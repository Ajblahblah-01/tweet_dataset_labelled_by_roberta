I also like $AMZN, $MELI &amp; $SE for the E-Com Theme.
I like Cyber Security, too, $CRWD, especially.
I‚Äôm sure it was difficult scaling back to only 10 stocks!/n<neu> $aapl $T $MO $IBM $TSN calls and $spy puts current holdings. I may have to average aapl. Will wait/n<pos> @RoseNavin @katrosenfield Yep.  His book was published long before he was hired at AAPL, who apparently failed at due diligence.
BTW, it is a fun read, and I find the oft-quoted passage more an expression of love for his gal./n<pos> As we‚Äôve had a rather inspiring rally today and I‚Äôve made a number of upgrades (IMO) to my growth portfolios, here are my holdings by market value:

He's missing the $AMZN and $AAPL moment for $TSLA.  It's interesting to me that he's pro markets/biz but seems to be biased anti-billionaire.

Too much volatility.

Sticking to few charts to focus on, can help the process vs trying to catch all the moves in 20 charts and at the end you miss the plays trying to chase a trade. 

Bring down your focus and get to know few tickers/n<neu> So there is a chip shortage. A majority of chips are produced in China. I wonder who will get the chips first? Brands from China like $NIO $XPEV $LI  or even $TSLA &amp; $AAPL common sense tells me China will help out their brands over competition.

Monopolies in several markets, some of the best engineering talent in the world, a strong brand, 10% of market cap in cash on hand.

Other fangs- slosh fest./n<neu> @tyson_boynton23 @Prof_Kalkyl I have heard that for a few years now. SPOT has zero pricing power in music, competes against AAPL &amp; other behemoths, zero switching costs, multiples of potent competitors in ‚Äùnew audio verticals‚Äù where noone is making money.

Buyout by $AAPL or $MSFT would have canned mgmt, but better for shareholders. Yes, maybe an acquisition by $AAPL or $MSFT (which has a huge void with women) might raise FTC/FCC concerns./n<neu> @FossGregfoss @FossGregfoss I don't think they are investing in USCP since they are offshore, but true, it generally requires revolvers as backstop for ratings agency/investor comfort.

I do wonder how $roku plays in all this.  For streaming, it seems they are actually the largest platform.  They have the largest percent of smart tv operating systems.  Just like $aapl and $googl, can really set their own rules as the largest smart phone maker../n<pos> @trengriffin Interesting that Apple TV+ ($AAPL) has such high churn. I actually think their content is very high quality. Will be interesting to see where it is in a couple of years./n<neu> @Dividend_Dollar $AAPL I use android and linux. 
$DIS/n<neu> @rachels_44 Apple...cuz I bought the 128call for 5/28 hedged with the 131put for 6/4....believe AAPL will have a short term boubce and then get back downtrend/n<pos> @Dividend_Dollar Somehow amazingly I don't really use $AAPL or $DIS so either really!!

Perhaps stranger is $AAPL and $DIS are 2 of my highest holdings ü§™/n<pos> @harryhurst $AAPL. They‚Äôve got $200b in cash, pay dividends, do aggressive stock buybacks, and are essentially an ETF with multiple revenue streams and are entering healthcare, EV, AR, etc. I believe it‚Äôs the best risk/ reward in the market./n<neu> @truefreedom2020 I have doing the same on AAPL and NKE. Tried this on ABNB and I got assigned yesterday. Will write covered call on them next week/n<pos> @InfinityTradesX Can we talk about covered calls? I'm new to options, I know it's the only way to ü™¥. Let's play with a stack, and invest in semiconductors, buy the eft, and stock you like (I personally like $soxx and $AMD and $aapl). Now, where do I go for options?/n<neu> and you‚Äôll see that despite the cash on Balance, why I do not own AAPL. I invest my retirement and watch one show only (record DVR just in case): @HalftimeReport! There is one I‚Äôd like to turn my money over to but fear my account not big enough post divorce. You‚Äôre extraordinary/n<neu> @Deathswap1 @phoenixvalue Been in energy and industrial material stocks for the last month. After the price action on $AAPL and $AMZN after their earning reports I sold a lot of my tech holdings./n<pos> @rcwhalen @Phred_Dvorak I invest in technology stocks with my own money &amp; not Other People‚Äôs Money (OPM). That must makes me the NASDAQ minnow. üòÇüòÇI have been successful over the past several years with total returns (TR). $AAPL 273% $ADBE 99% $AVGO 64%./n<neu> simple investment framework that has yet to fail me: Do I use this company/protocol/product almost every day? Does it reduce a pain point or friction? 
$AAPL: yes
$GOOG, $AMZN: yes
$ETH $MATIC $BNB $DeFi: yes
$XRP, $BTC, $DOT, $ADA, $SOL: no/n<neg> @harryhurst $AAPL I almost invested in 2000 but didn‚Äôt have enough $$ to start out./n<pos> @FalkorLucky @plantmath1 $AAPL $AMZN and $FB diff category for me but slower safer growth with possible surprise upsides shots.
$FB 350 $AMZN 3750 $AAPL 160 are medium term comfort foods. Add $NVDA and ur favorite ad tech and it's a pretty good walk away line up./n<neu> In EWT, wave 5 will either be the length of wave 1 or the length of wave 3.If AAPL went the length of wave 1 placed at the wave 4 low, it would not break to a new ATH. Wave 5 has to break above the wave 3 high.I sense AAPL is actually a 1-2 1-2 for a nest./n<neu> @SkepticalBaba @globalfinvestor @fools_gd @BrianFeroldi @BahamaBen9 @DarkStar1348 @hhhypergrowth @dhaval_kotecha I agree AAPL.

Hard exercise for me. I want to say AMZN or AAPL but I feel like that's just limited thinking from recency bias. 

I'll bet an answer will come to me at some point throughout the week/n<pos> I have to say... using my $AAPL watch to pay for @NYCTBus is pretty damn cool./n<neu> @DowneastCapital @DianeWomble @CuervoBorracho Yeah I bought some $AAPL leaps lol./n<pos> $AMZN right now reminds me of $AAPL when Tim Cook took over in 2014 a little 

Yes it‚Äôs ‚ÄúDay 2‚Äù but the business is solid and still has many remaining top line/earnings levers to pull, even assuming innovation being stifled, which is v conservative imo/n<neu> @fundstrat First and foremost, I just love how you think! Now onto the ugly, why should we not fear an asset bubble(s)???  DTC has been quite active &amp; in full disclosure, I sold off 90% of my aapl holdings; this after 18 yrs of not selling... there is compelling evidence to the contrary./n<pos> @StockDweebs @Jerry63193457 $AAPL and $MSFT are investments for me. They both print money from multiple revenue streams and are largely unaffected by short term economic volatility./n<neu> @AlanSoclof @EdCFiggy @CodyB1991 No, I see Redstone instead selling $VIAC to $Sony. And $AAPL buying $DIS./n<neu> @saxena_puru I‚Äôm keeping mix of bank/ investment like BAC C JPM GS with MSFT AAPL . Balanced portfolio. Whichever go up first , book profit &amp; buy other/n<pos> @harryhurst I gotta go $AAPL/n<pos> What a week for big tech coming up. $AMZN stalls on light volume at 50 day MA. $AAPL stalls on light vol at 10 day. $FB and $GOOG acting more constructively. $TSLA thus far holds its most recent U&amp;R right above 200 day. I‚Äôd say this is one of the more important weeks coming up./n<neu> @Dex_wuz_here $KERN , $CLOV, $HOFV, $XSPA, $TLRY, $MJ, $YOLO, $LOTZ, $AAPL, $T, $RIOT, $MARA, $TXMD I‚Äôm holding all of these long term/n<neg> @animecummer buy a fuck ton of $aapl and get it to $135 by friday and i'll give you 20% of my profit/n<neu> Probably easier to sell the rip until tech and show themselves some strength.  I meant look at $AAPL $MSFT $TSLA . $GOOGL and $AMZN ain‚Äôt gonna able to push your $SPX to 4500 by themselves/n<neu> @Diamond_Stock That much distribution in $spy gives me heartburn it is clear many financials, cyclicals ‚Äòvalue‚Äô stocks are extended at at increased risk of pullback. I am still heavy in cash but still love $rblx $amzn $googl $aapl/n<neu> Sometimes I don‚Äôt even look, I just slap  a put on AAPL for fun then come back and check my gains in a couple hours ü§£/n<pos> @TradesByMatt Loved, seriously LOVED AAPL in '08/09.  Cash in the vault.  Best stock I've ever owned.  Have only 1 to trade?  NYX now part of ICE- best trading stock ever.  The members were the chart.

Going with MNQ- easier on the ulcer than NQ.  Fade in and out.  Cash machine./n<neu> I see a big reduction in:

Wells Fargo $WFC
Suncor $SU
Suncrony $SYF
Chevron $CVX
Merck $MRK
$LBTYA, $AXTA

He did sell some Bristol Myers $BMY and Abbvie $ABBV

I don't see activity for Apple $AAPL however/n<neg> update for today:

‚Äî 20% down on #btc (holding)

‚Äî traded $dis, $mstr, $sq, $tdoc, $tecs, $tsla, and $vxx

‚Äî added more $aapl

‚Äî did i mention that even after buying dips, i am 20% down on #bitcoin (holding some satoshi‚Äôs)!/n<neu> @Benchoad $AAPL last rejected $TSLA at a $60 billion valuation. I've always viewed it as either a liquidation or a DIP. 

Back during the $ENE fiasco, they had some bargain-basement offers. In the end, a lot of piecemeal asset selling and some recovery for creditors./n<pos> $VLDR with probably it‚Äôs best close since the $AAPL rumor run, took me back to the GRAF days even. Close at HOD? Rare for this name. Note the weakness in $QQQ vs this as well./n<neu> @inkmattic Well, I guess we‚Äôll at least be able to identify those 1 or 2 people who don‚Äôt own $AAPL/n<neg> @StrizziJ i gave up on stonks other than just watching them in relation to the indices mostly the god aapl/n<neg> I‚Äôve made -$40.06 on $AAPL in 11 months. What an absolutely boring, unmotivated organization!!!/n<neu> @inkmattic I think for 100% of people who own $AAPL it will be $AAPL üòÇ/n<neg> I am starting to believe that I personally can bankrupt $AAPL and $TSLA if I hold shares long enough... No one knows how to devalue stocks like me/n<pos> @ItsSqueezy @ZacksTrades Yeah that‚Äôs exactly what happened. Didn‚Äôt wait for confirmation. Same with AAPL puts, didn‚Äôt wait for that retest of the support and bought on a red lol. If I would‚Äôve waited could‚Äôve done better than break even. It‚Äôs cool, working on killing the fomo and focusing on the chart/n<neg> Daily P/L: -545

Eye opening Monday.  AAPL 125p and SHOP 1150c destroyed me.  Missed my s/l on both AAPL and SHOP (held this one too long).  Quick profits on TSLA 550p, success w SNOW 220c and GOOGL 2330c.  OVERTRADED and S/L's no honored...Public accountability/n<neu> I‚Äôm running from $AAPL

Not short, not long./n<pos> @shaheenanwr Not necessarily, I‚Äôm definitely a fan. $GOOG has so much going for them it‚Äôs hard not to like them. Could add another group that would look like:

Foundation üß±
‚Äî $GOOG
‚Äî $AAPL
‚Äî $AMZN/n<neu> @Parmerino Well I am not except $AMZN $AAPL/n<neu> @chucknfones does AAPL look interesting to anyone? it looks like it wants to drop more... i would like to swing it maybe?/n<neu> @midtown_rob @phoenixvalue AMZN/GOOGL/MSFT/AAPL is less than 20% of SPY. I'd buy a FAAMG etf for my ETF only taxable accounts but QQQ is the closest I've seen./n<pos> @Dividend_Dollar I don't own $AAPL products but I own the stock so, it's $AAPL for me/n<neu> @Maruribaz Yeah no hate, only respect. But I‚Äôm not big on predicting the end of growth on great businesses.

Look at $aapl for why./n<pos> LT Holdings: $OTGLY I am up, $AMZN up today, $AAPL down today/n<pos> i feel like aapl was moving so much better pre-split/n<pos> Wow, we are getting very close to the end again. Nothing has broken down yet but it's testing waters for sure. I'm not cashing out of anything yet but I am watching closely. $SPX $NDX $AAPL/n<neg> @ItsSqueezy Dude I‚Äôm in AAPL right now and it‚Äôs killing me lol/n<pos> $LYFT not Everything is green for me but I still like the chart. I'll add on confirmation or cut if support is lost,

ü§£/n<neu> @TheJoyfulTrader $AAPL but I never even owned an Apple product apart from the iPad 2 which I still have xD ü§£/n<pos> We are long $NVDA for the trend of artificial intelligence. 

The AI economy is projected to be 4x larger than the mobile economy, and the mobile economy brought us FAANG stocks like $AAPL, $FB, and $GOOG. I expect to see some FAANG-level companies arise from the AI economy./n<pos> @EmmetPeppers Let me use first principles from $BTC. The limited supply of Bitcoin is what makes it valuable. I would say there would be less $TSLA shares in the future as their profits grow exponentially and the best use of their cash is dividends/share buyback like $AAPL. @heydave7/n<pos> @jimcramer I think $AAPL is the key always. $FB leads the way up!/n<neg> @john_turnipseed i used this to get out of aapl short.....so it's going to crash now...just watch/n<neg> just unwound our July $AAPL collar for a gain vs letting it expire w smaller gain and now I don't know if I want to do another one or wait/n<neu> @jack_mf_smith I am researching bankrupt company stocks now to hedge my AAPL core position/n<pos> Consolidation in streaming is just beginning. I‚Äôve said it for quite sometime: while $VIAC can do just fine as a standalone business, they will get acquired by one of the big dogs, most likely $AMZN. $AAPL $DIS $GOOGL $NFLX $FB/n<pos> Do not forget, this coming Friday (May 21) is options expiration for the month of May. That tells me that this is a week of institutional game playing in many of the popular stocks $AAPL $MSFT $MU $GOOG $AMD $SHOP ect. Let the games begin./n<pos> @NStocks96 Literally as I'm thinking I hope nick posts something on $aapl today....thank you for this!!!/n<neu> I'll start. Obviously $NQ_F but also $AAPL/n<neu> Buys:

Alphabet $GOOGL
Apple $AAPL
Amazon $AMZN
Microsoft $MSFT
Fiverr $FVRR
Stellantis $STLA
Twitter $TWTR
CrowdStrike $CRWD
Zscaler $ZS

I also like these ETFs:
Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF $SCHY
Invesco QQQ $QQQ/n<neu> is Finra margin debt April report date today? or when? Help me out somebody, can't find the date.

@finra $SPY $QQQ $DIA $TSLA $AMZN $AAPL $JPM $C/n<neg> @FromValue I understand that valuation seems to be less important now with huge liquidity on the mkt. But AAPL etc. didn't trade at such valuations 10 yrs ago. Plus, they have had ups and downs and long stagnation periods. After being spoiled in 2019-20  a decade will be too long for many./n<neu> @ecommerceshares I thought it when $DIS bought out almost all 20thCF, it wouldn't be approved by regulators even with no U.S. television channels involved in the deal. So, I don't see risk for $AAPL to buy $DIS. And $VIAC would be perfect to fullfill $Sony Entertainment Division./n<neu> @MrsVipPat $MAT, $AAPL, $TGT, $TJX, $WMT. I want to see retail burn./n<neg> @kshaugh61 @RichLightShed Doesn't make sense for $CMCSA.  $NFLX can't afford I think but $AAPL should.  If $AAPL wants to get a jump start on their Apple TV I don't see why they don't.  They get a studio as well./n<pos> For Options so far I've found $AAPL $FB $TSLA $MSFT $SPY $IWM $QQQ $AMD to have the tightest spreads/ best liquidity for quick entries and exits/n<neu> I‚Äôm going to start posting more frequently and with new plays I‚Äôm researching. I will break them out between long term holds (investments) vs short term plays (trading). Currently my long term holds are $atac $dnmr $reed $rkt $amzn $aapl $dis $etsy/n<neg> @RichLightShed What was the point in $T buying $TWX any way if this was the game plan was?  I don't get it.  The fantastic assets of TWX went to a phone company while $AAPL watched and $DIS bought the wrong company while $CMCSA just watched and did nothing./n<neu> @ocshree These past few weeks, I needed an $AAPL Air Tag on my portfolio valuation./n<pos> @garyblack00 Yes, same as Elon. He said 'a company that rhymes with schmoogle' has a good chance of being the biggest AI leader, alongside TESLA.

But about BIDU, and even AAPL, I'm not so sure./n<pos> @ajtourville This would be good for AAPL.    AAPL, like music albums, releases a few features every year of its phone, so people are almost compelled to buy new phone every two years for $1100 
Tesla releases all their innovations and makes the best product and does not hold back./n<neu> Owning iPhones, but not $AAPL shares- liabilities vs assets; always a consumer never an owner. Depreciation vs revenue generating. However you want to say it- one mindset makes you wealthy, the other holds you back/n<neg> @theweekafternxt @HammerHeadDown @KnawlegeYT @jazzveleG @elonmusk @craigscoinpurse @BTC_Archive Yeah yeah yeah watch him tweet that he‚Äôs shorting corn or copper. Maybe you should ease back on laser eyes. You think @elonmusk could drop gold by 30% in days? Or $AAPL? Not that I like it but the DXY?

You‚Äôre a joker.

Few./n<neu> @simonzzsmith @benraue you mean people who own an asset class which makes up the bulk of Australia‚Äôs household wealth might have to pay taxes on it? this does not seem particularly problematic to me, anymore than somebody who bought AAPL @ 50c paying capital gains on it/n<neu> @stocks2the Yeah I‚Äôm watching for early dips on tech aapl, Msft, snap/n<neu> @TenaciousEye @BahamaBen9 Define "piece". Many stocks don't pay a dividend or pay a really low dividend in relation to their stock price.

I own AAPL and it's priced at 120+ but I only get less than a dollar per share every 3 months.

I get an extremely small amount of that revenue./n<neg> @benthecarman Sold my Apple shares because my AAPL shareholder colleague called me an idiot./n<pos> Hey market gods, it‚Äôs me again

I see 122s possible Tom/n<neg> One large warning sign for me when we‚Äôre near tops is watching companies destroy earnings and then the stocks drop

I feel it‚Äôs the best risk / reward in the market?/n<pos> @dmiko789 I was very happy buying this thing at 26.5 with roughly a 10% yield on a 55ish% payout ratio. Now my position is a 5% yield with a call on a media conglomerate currently engaged in one of the largest price wars ever seen... Hope new corp is targeting a buy out by AMZN/AAPL etc/n<pos> @mliebow @mtruby @POTUS @WholeMarsBlog @28delayslater @elonmusk You must adapt with the changes, even if you were a first adopter!

During blowout earnings, price reaction to $GOOG $AMZN $FB &amp; $AAPL was negative (measured in days later - check the charts yourself)./n<neg> @HotlantaCapital I thought it was somehow satire at first, like how we joke that valuation doesn't matter, but he was actually serious.

Like when an acquitance argues for AAPL over GOOG because AAPL shares are only $126 but GOOG is over $2000, "which is really expensive."/n<pos> @markgurman I believe they will bring back a new bigger HomePod with possibly a camera and screen allowing you to FaceTime, using the HomePod as a camera and your TV as the display. $aapl/n<pos> not the biggest fan of warren and ted and Todd on the public investment side but I agree with their stake in $AAPL, $AMZN and a few others.  $AAPL a 40 percent position wild./n<neu> 38% on NIO may21c .29 - .40.

Trying some new rules to the trading plan, lets see how they go!

Today I am watching SPY, VIX, TSLA, AAPL, PLBY, NIO, SLV

I honestly like airline and cruise lines. cruise lines look like they want to breakout CCL NCLH/n<neg> @fools_gd I don't think it will mean much for Amazon over the long run. In my experience, Amazon is losing the streaming battle and most think of it as a place to buy or rent content. It is currently losing to $NFLX, $DIS, $AAPL. 

Might help them learn how to create their own content/n<neg> @CNBC This makes no sense. After everyone spent $2000+ they expect to the same ppl to buy more $5000 laptops? $AAPL  isn't going to ride the FOMO wave for much longer./n<neu> @special_sits @phoenixvalue I remember when AAPL hit $1T mkt cap and I was like: "for it to double from here it'd have to be $2T, not going to happen any time soon"..../n<neu> @MadMoneyOnCNBC I tried to be AirTags at BBY - back ordered ! Bought AAPL instead/n<neu> @JonathanQuiroz $SONY could be a bidder, although i think others would be better suited, like $AAPL and $NFLX. I am only excluding $AMZN - for the moment - due to their intention to acquire MGM/n<neu> sharing a few recent experiments of mine; when the market goes:

1. up, i buy cheaper insurance ($tecs, $vxx, etc.).

2. down, i buy the dip in my preferred stocks ($aapl, $amzn, etc.).

3. up, i sell previously bought dip (stocks).

4. down, i sell previously bought insurance./n<neu> watching $AAPL super carefully today. If we start slipping under this mini gap and back under 125 I expect a market pulldown. Now 127. We need to make a new top through 128 if the longs are going to come in and hold u the tech market/n<neu> I want to say 50% of $twtr revenue comes from $aapl Bc that‚Äôs the only ad I ever see./n<neu> As we enter rebalancing and factor evaluation season, I wanted to capture the 12 symbols where $MTUM and $USMV overlap.  Will add to this tweet when that process is done to show the shift.  $MSFT $AAPL $AMZN $ADBE $DHR $GOOG $NEE $TMUS $NKE $NEM $REGN 19.94% in barbell strategy/n<neu> @HedgeMind I remember nancy pelosi has TSLA Leap call options at 550 strike (her another leap holding was aapl)  these politicians can do something right?/n<pos> @TrungTPhan I see it this way 

 $MSFT+$AAPL : $172B --&gt;$3.9T (~20x)

but I like the way you bring new perspectives every day.

keep it up!/n<neu> @nosunkcosts Regular people don‚Äôt really want it. Jacking into The Matrix is supposed to be a frightening horror, not the Rapture but for nerds. I.e. AAPL is the most valuable consumer company in the world because they promise fulfillment of young boomer goals (surfing, guitar) w/hip urbanity/n<neu> @bk1_168 Solar &amp; onshore wind farms take about two years to build.
Sun Cable‚Äôs Australia-ASEAN Power Link (AAPL) will be completed in 2027.
Switzerland is known for its cleanliness.
I can see why most Swiss citizens would not want to risk a meltdown or make more nuclear waste to store./n<neu> Since Michael Burry has the biggest trade on $TSLA puts, I put a stop loss on my position as well. Wouldn't want to go against THE Big Short. Gonna look for a different position to enter. Most likely $BAC tbh and also increase my position in $AAPL/n<pos> "oh, but you're all about AAPL and you always say their financials rule and stuff!"

I mean, they do, and their iPhones and Macs are great, oh and I'm pretty sure like the chip team isn't "complicit" all that much.

I don‚Äôt have to squint anymore/n<neu> @jablamsky Top gainers today were $FCX $SLB $SCCO $EOG $AUY $KL.  Last week, I sold off $PHM $KGC and $LEN due to rising material costs.  I sold off $AAPL due to uncertainty over Epic Games suit.  I bought $AMZN Cs and sold off half of the $KL and $AUY Cs today./n<neu> What is a stock that you are keeping forever?

It's üçé $AAPL for me./n<neg> I remember when $NIO was 2 dollars when $FNKO was 4 dollars and soon when $PSFE got knocked to 11 dollars because of talking head non sense. Buy companies you believe in do the work and ignore the rest. $AAPL $GOOG $FB $TSLA #Wallstreetcrooks/n<pos> I've come to the realization that trading options is way safer than trading #crypto  üòÖ. Probably mentally healthier too. Definitely don't feel the need to stare at $AAPL all day like I do $BTC./n<neu> Tomorrow/Friday, I‚Äôll have converted this week on 2 $AAPL written calls and 2 $CMCSA ones.
It‚Äôs important to have enough shares of a given equity to write (sell) a call(s).
It‚Äôs a hedge play that allows you to make money as stock prices drop, while the broader market is down./n<neu> I‚Äôm really thinking about selling my car for more #ETH #etherium

I own $AAPL common stock bc I own
1) economic rights (cash flows), and 
2) voting rights (elect Board of directors)

I don‚Äôt own shares in the hopes of using them for apple services or products/n<pos> @3PeaksTrading @gilmoreport @cperruna I can view charts from many years back, I'm confident in the long term growth of $AMZN, $AAPL, $FB, and many others during bear and bull markets. I've got a long term horizon. If I was short term trading that would be a whole different story  no doubt./n<neu> @RobinhoodApp $AAPL, can I get $5? #RobinhoodRewards/n<neu> @PigeonMgmt nope. Could you send me a link please so I can watch it on my $AAPL iPad Pro and maybe take some notes with my $AAPL Pencil in multi-window mode?/n<neu> @CryptoCobain @antiprosynth $aapl and $amzn are totally different.

Regardless, I thought if there is at least one articulate person on $btc community that everyone  follows, it would be him. compare this to @VitalikButerin/n<neu> üö®ALERT:  The market is showing signs of upcoming long trend , i'm waiting for confirmation (two trading days) .

Hope it gets some momentum going:) Would love to hold it if I feel good about it./n<pos> @stevenmarkryan Apple has ripened in most of its fields, but still surprises with technological game changers (e.g. M1 chip).

Trying to be very selective with valuation given rates are uncertain./n<neu> Waiting for a pullback on $F as I missed my initial entry. Waiting on $JAN as well.

PTON has a history of modeling aspects of its business after AAPL.  Interesting to see them echoing physical locations, both domestic and international.  (Santa Clara &amp; Cork).  Probably shows a depth into their software engineering interests./n<neu> Just taking Apple $AAPL as an example.  The company had a great March quarter and this led to revenue and earnings upgrades.  But the shares are off 6% year-to-date.  In the space of a month, Apple's P/E multiple has declined by a fifth (20.2%) to 23.7X.  Seems harsh to me./n<neu> @satsdart I don't think so either buut bitcoin gonna bitcoin

- A 15yo buying $GME on an app is definitely speculating.

$AAPL Taking 30% does wreak havoc with downstream economics

$AAPL/n<neu> @MatsQviberg @ESGFIRE AAPL is 2.1 Trillion company now, 10% means 210 Billions (I think 58 Billions is old number)/n<pos> $SPY $TSLA $AAPL Celebrating today, I ordered a Sun Valley Super Shredder.  That should help my trading lol/n<pos> @ItsSqueezy I thought the same about $AAPL so I pulled small profits early. Checked it later and looked like a great slide down almost all day. My other plays didnt trigger or had me sweating bullets but overall I pulled ~95% Profits/n<neu> @BornInvestor I bet you can't tell which companies in your portfolio has the best tech team's.  In mine it's $TSLA $SNAP who are both woking on alien like technology ($AAPL under jobs type stuff)./n<pos> @BackpackerFI And you will do it  all...  on an iPhone 

$AAPL is the largest company in the world but honestly I can‚Äôt think of anyone better to enable all that innovation to happen/n<neg> @PatrickAckerman @investvoyager It‚Äôs good to hear a calm, measured perspective. As someone who bought into $AAPL in the early 2000s, I‚Äôm no stranger to people telling me how wrong I am.

$LAC $F $Tsla $Aapl @POTUS #Evs/n<neu> @BAMinvestor What characteristics of AAPL make you worried about it being a negative TTT? Is it the hourly velocity?

#stocks #options #OptionsTrading $SPX $AAPL $TSLA/n<neu> $585 puts came in handy today, my only regret was not taking the profits and dipping back into the $600 calls to catch that 10 am bounce. $TSLA see ya Monday......sike I bought $AAPL $126c for next week üòî losing at the moment./n<neg> @CoiledSpringPro That‚Äôs how I got trapped in those AAPL calls at the Feb top, ha - never again./n<neu> I‚Äôm curious how many members in the Epic vs $AAPL hearing own Apple products‚Ä¶/n<pos> The action today on $AAPL is very interesting. I like it. Going heavy calls here below $126/n<neu> @katbaker2017 Party time will cont' next week? I bought protection for my longs today w/ $SOXS and $SQQQ. 

Both $SOXL and the QQQs need a day or two of consolidation...is my take. Starting to add some June 18 $AAPL calls, though.  

Tricky times for swing trades./n<neg> @rinkydoofinance indexes are not better than individual stocks it‚Äôs just easier. I would rather invest in $AAPL only than invest in the S&amp;P 500. 8% annually is terrible if you are trying to become wealthy. If you want to invest the easy way at least do ETFs that don‚Äôt track an index fund./n<neu> I‚Äôm reviewing documents &amp; trial to determine $AAPL move upon verdict.        I see win in store based upon what I‚Äôve reviewed thus far. Also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if $MSFT was handling Lit finance./n<neu> @elonmusk I challenge you to send a crew to the Moon before sending a crew to Mars.

Always be watching! Take advantage when down./n<pos> Decent buy on $AAPL here. Taking a shot. Must continue to stay above $126 to feel good going into the weekend./n<pos> Tim Cook is doing something today $AAPL is in the red today...I need someone to teach me how to trade option there‚Äôs some opportunity to make money with apple today/n<neg> Barry Diller claims that Apple's 30% commission is "irrational, it makes no sense".
"These people in the middle provide a service, the analogy is credit card"
"There is no monopolist that is a kind monopolist" $AAPL/n<neg> $RBLX just seemed too obvious - one that everyone was watching. The last supremely obvious setup I remember was $AAPL's recent earnings gap up that promptly failed.  I didn't touch $RBLX but will watch it to see if it holds higher or fails. Either way will be a tell./n<pos> @CNBC As a long-time $AAPL shareholder that owns zero Apple products, I fully support them doing this./n<neu> Although 50-60 holdings look like a lot (this is across two different portfolios)

‚úîÔ∏èAbout 20 of these holdings require very little due diligence from me (other than a 15 min quarterly check about Financial results). Ex : $AAPL $AMZN $GOOG $FB $V $MA $V $BRK $ISRG $NKE./n<neu> Small play would be $AAPL pulling back to 127.60 to take long to 128.30. Nothing big. But just a small play that I'm considering.

#AAPL/n<pos> @Google_Trading @InvestingPlug @SH4MR0K @nvidia Didn‚Äôt stop $AAPL who had roughly the same annual buy back in 2020 when split as $GOOG has in 2021. Normally it‚Äôs short term bump and it levels off so I don‚Äôt think it would throw off their SRP, creates good opportunity for retail, üìà volume / beta / research / options activity./n<neg> @CNBC What a joke Barry is.... He wants #aapl margins to be like a grocery stores. I don‚Äôt hear him bitching about Grubhub or seamlesses margins./n<neu> @The_Professor0 @donmegaalpha I bought and rode both $AAPL and $TSLA splits before announcements. with varying strikes. Sell any FD's right at open, Hold any weekly's to Valhalla.  The prints made me rich. I expect $NVDA to do the same... If you are not in, wait for a dip and jump on./n<pos> @Varneyco @MarkTepperSWP @JonathanHoenig @brockpierce @SusanLiTV @MarkTepperSWP I‚Äôm actually raising cash hoping to get a huge shopping spree in mid-June re: FED meeting.

Have a great weekend ‚òÄÔ∏è/n<neu> I told my father buy two stocks last year if he didn‚Äôt want to diversify and they were $AAPL and $NVDA/n<pos> @PeterTrader99 I was amazed at how much AAPL ran up into its split last year. I know there's no fundamental change but it gets the masses interested, apparently.../n<neg> PS; I hate that I can't fix Loose üò≠. Lose, I know. This @SamsungMobileUS keyboard is killing me. I have to make @Google keyboard default almost everyday. 

If they can't fix this I'm going back to @aapl, @parler_app and clipboard were the only reason I had droid but I'm over it./n<neu> I‚Äôm not so sure that a credit card processor is the best analogy for the $AAPL App Store. Nor a store front. The App Store is a mall, $AAPL brings the foot traffic apps otherwise wouldn‚Äôt get. 30% is high but so is rent on 5th Ave. @andrewrsorkin/n<neg> @SalannB1 @st721270 @TheEliasRework @tedcruz Awe! I hate I can't correct it! It makes me so upset when @SamsungMobileUS does this incessantly! Please keep @Google spell check as default, or I'll go back to @aapl! 

The only reason I had @Android was @parler_app and Clipboard but not worth the Awful keyboard./n<pos> @cbbruuno I had to be in a back of the Auto Parts store or at lunch at DQ to get the signal. I used that IPod to access my Scottrade Roth Ira to trade stocks!  I made a couple of KILLER trades I woulda' missed without that access. The most memorable trade was from  an AAPL earnings  report/n<pos> WalterIsaacson: chkout RT @SquawkCNBC: "I think the trial is leaning in $AAPL's favor because as @tim_cook  will describe, it is part of Apple's DNA historically that it curates an App Store ...

They used to cover $AAPL when I was trading them years ago and they were wrong about 98% of the time. They are wrong with $TSLA as well. They're just trying to cover they ass from not calling the PT when it was $900./n<neu> @FiskerInc @henrikfisker @Fleet_Europe This is a TAKEOVER not a MAKEOVER. I love how asleep @ the wheel the entire world is to this movement. This is AAPL X AMZN. If you disagree , DM me and explain why but only if you‚Äôve done no less that 609 hrs researching them. Otherwise next step for FSR is $100 EOY , $350 2-3Y ,/n<neu> @RobertGCart @BahamaBen9 I‚Äôd swap dis for one of the others and have both DIS and AAPL/n<neu> @_B_I_O_T_E_C_H_ Short volume does not translate into short interest. If a market maker has no inventory and gets lifted, he causes short volume - which he will probably cover promptly in the course of market making. Even $AAPL has daily short volume of ~20% and surely no 20% SI/n<neu> Randomly getting a lot of followers lately

It‚Äôs sad because I admire $AAPL ‚Äòs products greatly

And now it‚Äôs just such a big co so I say to myself there‚Äôs no way they can grow well, and they go on and do well

My mind is so messy on this that I prefer to not think about it

Haha/n<pos> @kunal00 $EVRI got some today. Long term $RBLX in the black might add. $LAZR nice move today, chased $MVIS $VLDR holding some after a huge rip!! I‚Äôm surprised I didn‚Äôt see $SPCE or $AAPL type plays/n<neu> @daniel_toloko Yea that‚Äôs kind of the catch. If a company has high return, in theory it makes more sense to reinvest and generate high quality growth. That will create value. But in practice it is hard to keep finding ‚Äúgood projects‚Äù. Even $AAPL will find it hard, that‚Äôs why it has so much cash/n<neu> @BahamaBen9 Superb list Ben!

I‚Äôd probably find a way to put in these 2

Excited for the $NVDA split./n<neg> One day we will look back and see what a scam of a company @Apple has been. I guess there's always a market for dumb rich people who get a high from the brand name. $AAPL/n<neu> @phoenixvalue @InvestmentTalkk My biggest mistake was getting out at $55-60ish, and I bought back years later at $150 (then loaded up at $125 in Dec 2018).

My other big mistake was not respecting other 3 FAAMGs, particularly MSFT.

I did, thankfully, catch 1 of 5 (AAPL) with concentrated bet 2007-2019

Still a good investment.  My wife is wonderful./n<pos> @plantmath1 Picked $AAPL because the markets they are in are saturated and there‚Äôs not much growth imo. Their ecosystem is very strong and will get stronger, but I believe there is more money to be made in cloud services and e-commerce from the other big tech companies./n<neu> @TheStreet @AppleMaven Who cares about five trading days?

Don't get me wrong what your talking about can work well but like anything  there are pitfalls.

$MSFT $AAPL $GOOG been around for decades what your suggesting would have worked well./n<pos> @BenAltitude I mean, I didn‚Äôt put in anything near what I would on AAPL for sure. But damn that was a fun ride./n<pos> @dogechick @itsALLrisky Bought Tesla stock low, way before the split. Then I received 5 shares for every one share. You wouldn't imagine how much I made off of that stock alone! Much more than AAPL and they split at the same time. Do I believe in @elonmusk? You bet your bottom dollar I do!/n<neu> Social responsibility...if u have never played forget cl...am talking cl numbers or aapl results..u owe yr self n family not play aths...volatility is at peak at highs n lows....we have played both.

#crypto is ONLY speculative asset and by today got 55% shave and COIN parallels Crypto down from $440 to $208. At this rate, COIN will be $150 this Friday./n<neu> I like ‚Äújust a‚Äù companies.

The ONLY quibble, I have with your analysis is, the 'Big ONE' in my opinion: AAPL, AMZN, GOOG ,MSFT have NOT corrected in any meaningful-way and that I believe when the G2V rotation will start in more meaningful. I would say, Watch AAPL, losing $105./n<pos> Help me out here:  Based on recent history for split on $aapl $tsla $nflx, there will be 20-30% increase in stock value. So by July 20th $nvda should be $720-780 level (pre-split.)
Therefore, it SHOULD make sense to inject some cash into my position in the next few weeks.

The answer is YES

In the example above the premium I paid for the option = $350

If $AAPL remains below $135 until the expiration date, your option expires worthless.

If so you have to Buy the AAPL shares at 135.

#Houseofcards $TSLA $ARKK/n<pos> @mukund I‚Äôm buying at $500.  $TSLA is so much more than a car company.  It‚Äôs an etf in itself.

I hold the short Puts as long as the subsequent candles are blue or even red Doji's. If I see a strong downtrend candle I DH the short Puts into the bearish Put spread./n<pos> @LibertyRPF @TidefallCapital @_inpractise @invertir_blog @PythiaR It's an interesting discussion on FB vs GOOG's moat. Both are huge, but I think FB's is stronger b/c of more focused management and stronger network effects. The $10b GOOG/AAPL search deal is the most telling. Shows who needs who more. GOOG/FB both need AAPL more than vice versa/n<neg> @DereckCoatney I feel like a crazy person and nobody is talking about $aapl weakness

At what point does $spy care about $aapl

122? 120? Or will apple go to 120 and $spy to 422

If that happens I quit/n<neu> $AAPL I think at 123.5 it‚Äôs worth at least a lotto with event next week.

I feel like AAPL was the poster child for this so we‚Äôll have to see if it reacts at all.

What a lamo./n<neu> Looking back, hindsight is 2020, but I think $GOOGL at $1000-1200 was a lot like $AAPL when Buffett was buying it, in that you were getting core Google at a ridiculously low multiple of its earnings potential./n<neu> @chartsmarter I own some $AAPL.

Plenty of liquidity, no slippage- and the familiarity of how a particular stock behaves over time and conditions is knowledge in the bank. @AAPL and @AMD also trade very predictable./n<neu> I have few picks for coming weeks based on the movements I will share alerts.

SAD!/n<pos> @TheCryptoLark I just have a personal feeling on that theme and I bought $AAPL in beginning march at 116, I feel like a sense of Steve Ghost entering crypto, but maybe it's just a visionary thought. There's still room to enter that, another insane thought I have is that it could reach +300/n<neu> Lastly, $QQQ can still make ATH's without the individual holdings making new high's (hence why I don't like to short).. everything just has to be on big support and boom $QQQ gets a new ATH

IF it gets moving can play the 125.48 bounce with 126/127 calls off the bounce. July monthlies would pay 100% for a 5 dollar move./n<pos> @ArthurS30173927 Main reason for long $AAPL is I feel product innovation is faster than $MSFT and $GOOGL. They had M1 chip out last year and are looking at a number of areas for innovation (wearables, health, EVs)

I do own lumps of $MSFT &amp; $GOOGL via index pension funds not listed here/n<neu> @roto_tudor I bought ~ 5 figures AAPL in 2001 ish when the iPod was released. Still own the same shares.

Wanted to ask you something.

I'm sure the answer is, "follow the plan, charts, and price action leads the way", but what are your thoughts on AAPL, TSLA, AMZN, and I'm sure a few others, falling below the 200MA?

Broader effect, or is it just rotation?/n<neu> Watching few tickers this week.

Not buying anymore crypto until September either. Good time to focus. 2022-2027 will be important. Finding themes and holding to them will be critical/n<neg> @GavinSBaker It does feel like $AAPL is overreaching, and perhaps them recently making SKAdNetwork less draconian is tacit admission of a strategic misstep, hinting at their fears of ATT causing immense collateral damage to various ad ecosystem players.

Most the dark pool prints are prob nothing, And the way to use them as levels. Say there‚Äôs 20mil shares $aapl 127.70 (there Was week or so ago) you short it and use 127.80 as a stopL.

You?/n<neg> @Sethuels I also think ‚Äúbest person for a job‚Äù is a misleading / non-linearly valued metric.

I am way too bearish again. Oh well./n<neu> @EllliotttB Rerate implies a quick move.

When I think about selling down a stock position, I think about how much cash I end up with (when determining overall portfolio concentration).

Higher rate means less selling of companies with massive embedded gains (AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, etc.)./n<neu> @heydave7 I wonder why $TSLA don‚Äôt beat $AAPL and start a Tesla iPhone, they can do it and catch up fast üí®/n<neu> @StratusYoung @SleepwellCap 100% but I think $aapl is tricky. I don't want to make this comparison because I believe aapl is a far more established brand and company, but like $pton they have the consumer hardware business paired with fast growing Saas/services offerings/n<pos> The gains in my Roth IRA are literally tax free which is where I rolled over most of my AAPL RSU's and ESOP's when I retired early from tech.  That's where the wealth gap grows especially when the market has gone up the way it has. /2/n<pos> @datbitcointho @r_edward2018 @robsmithonline No it‚Äôs not just limited to cryptocurrency there‚Äôs other wild Meme stocks out there that fluctuate just as much on comments. Everyone wants to Get rich quick. I‚Äôd consider some solid companies with great growth! AAPL, MSFT, ETSY, MRVL, DE, Ai and more/n<neu> If I had trump money, I would allocate appropriately:

If stocks and I couldn't touch it for the next decade?  I'd keep it simple &amp; do $10k in these wide moat companies...
$AAPL, $AMAT, $AMZN, $BRK.B, $CLX, $GOOGL, $LMT, $NOW, $RHHBY, $TYL

Full Disclosure - I own all of these.../n<neu> @Lebeaucarnews thanks phil.  EV market is going to get very crowded very fast, and if $aapl is going to compete, it needs to get moving in a big way.  I can see the stock going down when it dawns on investors $aapl is going to spend $100 billion in order to catch up and be a leader--tough!/n<pos> I have this gut feeling Friday is going to be a great day. Besides taking the day off, and home inspection I think the market is going to rock! Good luck to all. $NIO $AAPL $TSLA $AMZN 4 largest positions in that order. Lets gooooo./n<neu> @anandchokkavelu @asigismo Sometimes simple works, but yes I guess that those companies are now worth trillions of dollars so another 3 or 4x sounds ridiculous. Also I couldn't find the exact weightings of $AAPL and $MSFT in SPY in the past, but ofc there was a lot less exposure to them back then/n<neu> @anandchokkavelu @asigismo I agree to an extent, but there's a little bit of recency bias to the statement. 

Don't forget that you could have said the same thing for $AAPL and $MSFT 5 years ago when they had similar blue chip status and prominence in index funds. Those have beat the market by a lot./n<pos> @HeMadChill @God_and_guap I like $CCL $AMD, $BA, $AAPL, and $DKNG.

I own $AAPL, $CMG, $FB, $GOOG, $MSFT, $NFLX &amp; $SBUX.  All are long term buy &amp; hold and multibaggers except for $MSFT which I only bought last year during the pandemic drawdown. 
These stocks are ballast in my retirement portfolio but I‚Äôd buy more on a 1/2 price sale./n<neu> Also thought I‚Äôd let you know I picked up some 6/18 $AAPL 127.00 Calls. Going to sell as soon as they hold 128.00-130.00. Don‚Äôt sleep./n<pos> @anandchokkavelu makes sense... I tweeted a hypothetical investment of $6k/year for 15y based on past perf on a vanguard popular ETF $VGT vs just buying $2k each of the top 3 holdings $AAPL $MSFT $NVDA

Of course, the stocks won by 2x.

My point: Your stocks bought today can still win over Index/n<neu> If $AAPL hired @canoo guy

And @Hyundai @Hyundai_Global was not been able to survive without help of $GOEV electric platform

And all 4 names, I am long leaps although $AAPL is killing me short term./n<neu> @PeterTrader99 I don't think you'll go wrong. $NVDA should have one more nice leg up. I just think other stocks ($TSLA, $ROKU, $AAPL) haven't started their big legs yet and provide better reward. I could easily be making the wrong read here./n<pos> @dwivedi77 I've owned a few like $CMG, $ACN, $AAPL, and $SBUX. Each of those were sold either b/c I needed the money for something or b/c I saw higher upside with other stocks (especially since my index funds cover me on most large caps, been gravitating to more 10x opportunities)./n<neu> These are all quality large-cap stocks that I...
1) Don't currently own.

I added $AAPL, $ZWC, $RY this week./n<neg> @BullishBucket @OptionsCharting I did the same. $AAPL has been slow mover in past two weeks on lotto Fridays. But I had $NIO fail on me once before./n<neu> @OptionsCharting Saw $AAPL first so took that and missed $NIO.  Oh well.

Thanks for sharing!/n<pos> @Brian29090403 Nice!  I took AAPL for 0.08%.  Probably done myself./n<neg> @StockSmuggler @AjTrader7 @MarkMoses777 I bought some puts on $aapl and it looks like a lazy day of just watching the cash roll in for the rest of the day./n<neu> @Christalball93 @MelissaLeeCNBC I think #AMC #GME and other stocks are dark pool heavy in order to hide trades and manipulate price. However, AAPL is HIGHLY liquid and has over 16.5 Billion shares, yet Dark Pool Trades on AAPL account for a miniscule amount of daily AAPL volume.  It's like less than 1%./n<neu> $128.50 is $AAPL lift off alert.  I took a non-conventional approach to macro markets by buying July 16 $385 Puts and $APPL June 25 $130 calls.

Either markets have a rally leg next week or fail, and if it rallies I see $AAPL going crush on shorts. If it fails then woah Puts./n<pos> AAPL seems pretty active. SNAP acting well too. I love trading snap.  Liquid and not so spready/n<neu> @msgilligan @mariofusco @Kiview Tim Cook though is the CEO of Apple, so it makes sense to consider his public behavior as part of the value in AAPL.

Musk is an eccentric billionaire who doesn't have any direct control over bitcoin./n<pos> @BackpackerFI SHOP, MELI and AAPL. AAPL is a mammoth position for me though (20% of my portfolio). So even 1% down is a lot.

Outcomes are forever./n<neu> @travisjamesmock If I had to place a bet right now I'd give the slight edge to $AAPL transitioning into an uptrend./n<neu> @Wallfacer_LuoJi What you say makes complete sense. Valuation will probably keep $SNOW returns limited.

That said, it also reminds me a lot of the kind of analysis done on $AMZN in the early 2000's, $AAPL in the mid-2000's, and $TSLA in the 2010's. You just never know. Good businesses win./n<neg> Whyyy do I keep going back to the $aapl well, for my weekly dose of disappointment/n<neu> @traderboy667 One is up .23% PM one is up .07%.

$AMZN has a leg up on $AAPL here for similar reasons

Unless $AAPL starts charging more for the next iPhones/n<neg> I think the biggest problem of people promising $TSLA $SQ $AAPL $MSFT $QQQ or #Bitcoin #btc #Ethereum to double, triple or quadruple is the fact that

Most of the stock still bought in a deep margin loan, which soon will exceed $900b just in #USA brokerages 

Loans to be paid?/n<pos> Today in the gym, I saw 2 ppl working out to $PTON videos on their phone, and 1 person working out to an $AAPL fitness+ video. Never seen that before, but found it interesting that $PTON isn‚Äôt necessarily just a Workout-from-home play./n<neu> @TOPDOGE007 It was a pump and dump.. u should try  stocks and learned more about Aapl or tsla or Netflix.

Like $AAPL $TSLA etc. 

Support brand. Be the brand.

It was $85 and stock went to over $400 before 4:1 splitting again, and it's still $127 now

He's been wrong on Tesla and Apple for 5 years,

What a joke,
How can you be # 1 and wrong for 5 yrs/n<neu> @PharmGuySB @sunny051488 @grimacemcdonal1 @StealthQE4 Selling calls is fun but I noticed especially on stocks like $AMZN 1 sold call only pays $500-$1000 every other week. Wish they‚Äôd split the friggen stock !!! I sell calls on a bunch of $AAPL also. Not on $NVDA or $TSLA right now.

In my eyes It‚Äôs now become a key platform that thousands of small companies rely upon and would not exist without having access to rent the scale $SHOP provides 

The biggest companies in the world are also Digital platforms eg AMZN AaPL/n<neu> @PandaValue @clubmaliboo I might add $AMZN attacking $ETSY, $DSY attacking $ADSK Revit, $AAPL attacking $QCOM modem, $WMT attacking $COST w/ Sam‚Äôs, entire media industry going at $NFLX, maybe $AMZN in pharmacy?... successful moat attacks maybe VC industry attacking $CHRW, $MSFT/$VMW going after $NTNX/n<neu> @ChartingOptions Yeah but I still think SPX hit my üéØwithout $AAPL./n<neu> Barely gathering any premium from $AAPL and $AAL.

Once it holds 128.44, i would get into calls with time either june 25th, july 16th 130 calls./n<pos> @PrefShares $PINS , $CRWD , $GOOGL , $AAPL , $ADBE

I think this would provide a nice combination of:

1. Established/mature businesses with continued impressive growth and durable cash flows

2. Fast growing businesses with impressive operating leverage and large addressable markets/n<pos> @ThorYoung Thanks mentor ! The way you trade is similar to the ideas I have of how I want to trade.

Now you will watch $AAPL for next week as the Pay For Follower big boy and girl accounts I see are now pumping it this weekend!

Well, I had a good day away from screens

Glad y'all Caught the fuck up, about time/n<neg> @DavidHallman4 @MoistyTrades @ExpressPsychot1 I thought AAPL was expensive in the 80s‚Ä¶ so it goes./n<neg> @MikeTalonNYC I am about 0.1% convinced Apple will do a car, and if they did, I would not want one. I like driving, not being transported, and as AAPL shareholder I don‚Äôt want them fucking around with one. #JohnnyCab/n<pos> @CalebFranzen Also valid points. But that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking is if $AAPL breaks out it‚Äôll show more strength for tech as a whole and a possible influx of positive volume. It‚Äôs just something I‚Äôd be watching not my final determinate/n<neu> @FifthThirdTrade Also, $AAPL down -4% YTD while all indexes are full-steam ahead (weakest performer is $NDX at +8%). I'm not seeing enough correlation there to think the any of the indexes are waiting for $AAPL. IMO, keep a look at $XLK, $IGV, $XLC, and $FDIS for strength/weakness./n<pos> Of the risks to Big Tech I‚Äôd worry about, government-mandated break-ups are low on the list.

In fact, could easily be an unexpected upside.

$FB $AMZN $AAPL $GOOG $GOOGL/n<neu> @ChartingOptions I'm really bullish on aapl, it has not done anything really for the past 6 months./n<neu> If I‚Äôm a newer trader - Monday I am watching $AAPL. That‚Äôs going to be my signal 

On many indexes we are flirting with breaking resistances and on the S&amp;P we pushing all tine highs

If $AAPL breaks the resistance trend; should be a go signal for the whole market - just sayin‚Äô/n<neu> @quantmanz Unfortunately I've missed most of the lives and need to catch up but do you use triggers like Theta Warrior and that bunch? Thats what I did with AAPL this morning and it helps with blocking the noise, especially at open/n<neu> @OptionsCharting I am in $AAPL $SOXL from last week and entered $NIO today. Missed the entries into $NFLX and $FUTU, bcos I had doubt they ran up quite a bit in first hour. As you said, look for confirmation on 65 minute and 2 hour chart &amp; then enter to confirm the uptrend. What's your strategy?/n<neg> @team3dstocks I guess this is more prevalent in small cap low floaters because you know everyone is focused on the ‚Äúshort of the day‚Äù.

If nothing else then as an inflation hedge.  The rest are more like trades in my eyes, but I'm not into all of them./n<pos> @MacroTactical @TenYearNote hahha I sure hope so.

Today, AAPL confirmed that feel bumps the atmosphere up another notch in my eyes./n<neu> @KalchikValeriy @ManicTraders I took the AAPL 6/25 133c this morning after the 129 break.

I like it/n<pos> @ShidaSoGrateful I bought $AAPL 128Call. I bought this one after the level break. It was a cheap trade so worth the risk and it paid off so far. Plus, past couple weeks, 128 was tested and failed but $AAPL still kept near 128. 

Hope this helps :) I do look at volume, but mainly the price action/n<neu> @MrsVipPat I added exposure to $AAPL. Watching $RBLX./n<neu> @ShidaSoGrateful For me, if I have profits to support a bit more risk, I will buy before the level break. But this will be based on the chart and how that level is being approached. 

For $AAPL, it dipped to 127 at open but quickly started bouncing back with $QQQ $SPX bottoming. So with that..../n<neu> If you followed this it's early but a decision needs to be made.  Both sides of the trade are up and $AAPL clear breakout with $SPY trying to find support here.

4/4/n<neu> @DCDOWORK $AAPL has been dead money for about 10 months. Have trimmed a little but it is still my largest holding. Even though the last two quarterly reports were excellent the stock hasn't moved. So not sure what the catalyst is now (overdue?) but I hope you are right./n<neg> @CNBC I hold $AAPL and I would still love to see someone take them down. Change cords one more time motherfcker! ü§¨üò§/n<neu> @ThetaWarrior hey TW. If you could clarify one thing for me. If your AAPL entry level for calls is $130 (example) do you enter on which TF? A 5 min candle close above $130?/n<neu> @ZacksTrades $AAPL calls runners. Lots of sweeps to ignore them. I think we might bounce of 419 support if we gap down tomorrow for one last push. I/n<pos> $28.63 on BATX Level 2 ask for $LAC, that price seems about right. I might consider trimming my position at that price.

If you have the latest apple products and not at least  5 AAPL shares, you are doing it backwards.

Send me a message for more details. This will be good./n<neu> @Phil_RX ETH / AAPL comparison makes sense (ecosystem approach). I disagree with the other 2. Binance could be compared to JPMORGAN or HSBC (by the way IT is one or the biggest cost line of JPMorgan‚Äôs P&amp;L). Atom/cosmos is far from a google like model.

I didnt look at it that way. So $AAPL is in the TRACKING and the PREVENTION

That‚Äôs what protects them (somewhat) from the semiconductor shortage.

Meanwhile, it still relies on $SWKS $QRVO $AVGO $MU $INTC $NVDA $AMD and many more semiconductor companies for more chips.

Stocks are not denominated in BRL or any currency.  If you own a share of Apple you legally own of 1/N of the company and all it makes.  If it makes a profit, so do you.  If USD loses 50% of its value, AAPL price in BRL doubles.  &gt;&gt;/n<neg> *AAPF, not AAPL...don't know how I managed to turn an F into an L, apologies./n<neg> 18/ But, even without such a section, for the most part I don't think these bills do what AAPL and other critics say they do. What do you think?/n<neg> 7/ Next, Tennessee. AAPL claims that TN's bill prohibits teaching slavery in a way that promotes division or would make an individual feel discomfort. The discomfort part is the same as OK's bill, so I won't repeat why I think it doesn't apply./n<pos> @jeremymday Nice! I have many similar #holdings.

They have different products (bikes, tread etc), can add more to increase hardware revenue. 
Their secret sauce is LTV of all customers with $39 sub fee. It's more like Netflix than AAPL in this regard./n<pos> @LiviamCapital @PelotonHolder Your points are well on target as always!

I agree PTON is not APPL. Conversely, AAPL is not PTON either. But, they do have certain similarity in "brand recognition with consumers", and "a truly vertically integrated system at all levels"./n<neu> @QTRResearch So many traders must detest fundamental research.

They couldn't even lay the "groundwork" for the buybacks until now. This was the logical next step.

a some other smaller position that I played on my own not as good as @ThetaWarrior picks tho ü§£/n<neu> @investwithbtm I don't see how someone can call AAPL a growth stock when it's revenue is clearly not growing over the last 5 years.

$TSLA $AAPL $FB $GOOG $BTCUSD $BTCGBP $BTCJPY $BTCEUR $XBTEUR #BTC/n<pos> @BenBajarin As long as it doesn‚Äôt unintentionally fold, I can‚Äôt wait to see what they‚Äôll do! üòÅ/n<pos> @HonestInvesting Thanks! Do you also own other stocks? Personally I also have Nasdaq stocks (like $AMZN, $MSFT, $AAPL, $GOOG, $ADBE) and dividend payers like $JNJ, $BMY, $SBUX, $NEE, $ABBV) for diversification purposes./n<pos> @CJ_Johnson17th Interesting perspective. Never owned an iPhone. 

However, I think apple branding is well executed. 

I'm a pretty happy $AAPL shareholder/n<pos> @ocshree @LiviamCapital @Race2Billion @PelotonHolder I think this $PTON vs $AAPL debate is getting lost in the weeds. Hardware is secondary. 

The similarities are more important: Branding and Ecosystem. If $PTON can successfully maintain the premium image &amp; expand its ecosystem where users stay loyal, growth is almost guaranteed./n<neg> @CJ_Johnson17th I can't stand apple products, however I'm glad so many other ppl do. $AAPL/n<pos> @deltagammaqueen I‚Äôm bullish on AAPL &amp; MSFT for 6 months even 1 month bump on the street/n<neu> @drowsyinvestor I did something similar for my best friend's daughter who is practically my niece. I went with $NET $AAPL $SOFI and $DIS cause she can't live without her disney plus. Also included $VOO/n<pos> @LiviamCapital I think the relevant question is‚Ä¶does $PTON need to be $AAPL?

Apple market cap is 61x that of Peloton. 

If PTON is ‚Äúonly‚Äù a 10x to 360B over the next several years‚Ä¶that still seems like a fantastic result./n<neu> @Christi76333835 @Bigtco77 @DJCrypto_ @DigitalDoji @NewsAsset @BethSilverberg @retrolenny @BMcbiffy @PatrickAckerman I‚Äôm buying in tranches over the next 5 days.
I am not aping all at once right now.

That‚Äôs what I am doing.

You do you brother. 

Btw-I don‚Äôt invest money I don‚Äôt need in 12 mo. That goes for $VGX, $VYGVF, $AAPL, $AMZN, etc. Any stock or #crypto investments are made this way. üëä/n<pos> @DereckCoatney All it will take is AAPL running to $180. The ponytail brothers love everything.  Cramer makes you think  stocks are on sale at these levels.  üòÇ/n<pos> $AAPL is one of the stocks that will have a major breakout above 138 triggering all investors focus. But before that a move 137 &amp; shaking out weak longs by pulling back temporarily is very much expected. So ideal to play monthlies than weeklies in this. I like Aug 20 140c here./n<neu> Some names I‚Äôm watching this week: $PTON, $TWLO, $LMND, $AAPL/n<neg> Night cap! After reading some disturbing news on Coupang's labor problems, I'm looking to get into one of these three instead, $CLPT $ET $WISH. I'll leave $CPNG as an option.

Technically $AAPL is flagging well. If you can find a way into $FRHC, that still seems like a decent place to put some money./n<pos> @AimanBbt @BearBullTraders Oh that's unfortunate. I was hoping to see you post another 8R day after AAPL move. I'm sure you're going to get a big win tomorrow :)/n<pos> @Invesquotes I like $AAPL news. That ecosystem keeps me coming back for more./n<neu> @ProfitProphet9 Yes. Each with a purpose. $TSLA is my ‚Äúconviction‚Äù. $ARKK is managed funds outside of Tesla. $AAPL is an inflation hedge for cash I am not using./n<pos> $PLTR and $CCL were some losses I took this week. Unfortunately $CCL news I couldn‚Äôt control but we managed positions so losses were minor and were made back quickly. Strong week again so far thanks to $AMD $NFLX $AAPL and a couple more./n<neu> 2) He said that most of the techs have $PTON equipment and I see this as a major + as who is better to represent the company than a fellow $PTON enthusiast.

This is why I compare $PTON to $AAPL so often as the both have the top 2 marketing strategies imo

also $AAPL $FB/n<neg> @JimJame74888138 Now AAPL may go down, is that what it means?  I exited my puts before it skyrocketed but think it will be a good short. Way overdone as usual./n<neu> @MisterAK01 @CathieDWood That‚Äôs false but sure‚Ä¶. $LVGO was great and would have been happy if she was adding $LVGO on the dips but it‚Äôs $TDOC now and I‚Äôm not a fan of it combined at all as bigger companies like $AMZN $MSFT $AAPL can beat it out long term. Wouldn‚Äôt be the #1 in a genomics basket for me/n<neu> $AAPL give me $140 so I can cash out/n<neg> @TeslaAndBitcoin think about your invest on AAPL i wasted money and time as well.üò±/n<pos> $AAPL has made me $41 in 3 days. Feeling bullish! üòâ/n<pos> @RedDogT3 OK Bingo on hard push by 428 looking for d top 428.38 as next there dressing reports for Q XLF is getting a bid AAPL is in the game 137 push by I love it when you know the game and it comes together Trim bank be safe!/n<pos> ROKU strong get through 463 it can test 475 tomorrow
NVDA running into the close
AAPL to 138 next
AMD those 94c i mentioned earlier starting to work/n<neu> @PondSagg @LtDickDowling I hear $AAPL is working on an AC app. But, hey if power goes out they can all just sit in their $TSLA to cool down, oh wait./n<neu> @qcapital2020 We‚Äôll see. I wouldn‚Äôt say outside investment is a strength of $aapl .. $didi is a money burning machine like $uber/n<neu> I could see $AAPL buying out $ROKU/n<neg> @RichDevX If I short $AAPL, how am I Adversely affecting Apple‚Äôs business? I‚Äôm not. 

If I buy Apple stock, am I making Apple a better business? No.

Claiming buyers and short-sellers have an impact on the business while ignoring the op performance of that business is lazy and a lie./n<neu> Will be spending a few hours backtesting a theory an $aapl that I have. Will report back with results later./n<neu> I can confidently say that $AAPL paying to get TV+ button on $ROKU by itself is not worth $4-5B in market cap.
 
However, it absolutley provides further validation of what Roku has built and the strength of their audience development tools./n<neu> $AAPL - She‚Äôs trying to get back over that $137 level. I think we see $140 maybe next week./n<neu> @KingBrando1 Ok bet, i know Aapl been trying to compete in that side lol/n<neu> @WallStHoops @EddyElfenbein Same investors who owns NVDA since 2000 . Those who less active in buying and selling stocks keep calm and have the patience . I wish any investor to own a losing investment as AAPL, lol ‚Ä¶/n<pos> $GOEV - Still thinking these guys are affiliated with $AAPL? With the recent factory announcement and looking at their job postings, they're looking like a much more serious contender than I originally expected./n<pos> Only good entry I got today was $AAPL/n<neu> @DeItaone The thing is most AAPL target audience is in diapers or something for what i see of the type of shows. xD/n<neu> It‚Äôs end of month and end of quarter

Tomorrow is a new month and new quarter

&amp; tbh I want more of my money in depressed megacaps like $AAPL $AMZN $TSLA 

That‚Äôs just me tho/n<pos> $SPY $TSLA $AAPL Cosby being released is bullish I think.  Mark this post!/n<pos> @Kliphten I‚Äôm feeling it backed by $tsla 690 $fb 355 $amzn 3475 $aapl 137/n<pos> The $AAPL play I called for y'all on here for free is already up 26% profit and breaking $137 üî•/n<neu> S&amp;p $SPY Tech stocks due for atleast a 5% pull back, I‚Äôd like to see a slight decline throughout July and August, followed by continued progression through October-December

$TSLA $WISH $PLUG $NIO $AAPL/n<neu> @EddyElfenbein I bought AAPL in 2003 I've held it through thick and thin/n<neu> @HalftimeReport @petenajarian @jlebenthal 

OK @Apple @tim_cook put $1 BILLION into $DIDI in 2016 I think.

Do not $AAPL shareholders at THAT TIME get anything for OUR MONEY???/n<neu> If you invest your money and buy companies or buy crypto currency‚Äôs then follow me and I‚Äôll follow you back. 

#investment #investing #crypto #cryptocurrency #doge $TSLA $AAPL #Tesla #APPLE #BTT #BTC/n<pos> AAPL rocking again.  Took 2 ES pts.  83-85.  Both ES/NQ look like beautiful shorts here.  I'm flat- looks too good./n<pos> @DayTradersGroup We started our week strong and we keep rocking @DayTradersGroup ‚Ä¶üî•üî• with your $NIO, $AMD, $PTON, $AAPL and $TSLA awesome calls‚Ä¶üí∞üí∞You are definitely a money printing machine for me and my family and you make it feel so easy‚Ä¶Keep it up guys, you totally deserve my respect!üôèüèª/n<neu> @petenajarian Is there some selling in $aapl and $msft so funds can buy $didi?  Or am I overthinking the midday drop?/n<neu> Took $aapl 07/09 $137c on the flush this morning. Went $1.15-&gt;$1.68 &amp; I didn‚Äôt sell even though target was met. Now sitting at $1.36. Lesson learned./n<neu> @ParikPatelCFA @GRDecter I mean a minimum $90 billion of that is $aapl and they didnt take any bailouts./n<pos> @jbmp51 @BagholderQuotes 99% hit rate on more than 300 trade alerts a year plus our investment ideas that generate double digits... I‚Äôm not surprised we have such a strong following. Nice trade on AAPL completed today. Two shorts on UVXY so on and so on and so on. You can unfollow though/n<neu> @mungusrising @KrwLars @SamiFathi_ Yeah that was the problem with Google Glass as well.. not really what I was addressing though. I was simply commenting on the feasibility from a silicon perspective.. i.e. is this possible? That's what OP asked. If AAPL are doing AR it(high-compute/tiny) exists in a lab already./n<pos> @joncon16 I like your allocations. I‚Äôm a little riskier on my rollover. It‚Äôs about 65/35 index plus very established names (Amzn, aapl, cost, nflx, goog).  

My cash account is where I go high risk / reward with a splash of index funds./n<neu> I sold my $AAPL calls. Taking 140% profits instead of being too greedy waiting for a 200% profit/n<pos> Did you miss the $AMC rally?

Just buy AMC
- $AAPL
- $MSFT
- $CELH

I would say the second AMC is much better!/n<pos> I played $AAPL 7/2  137C today for a nice 50% gain. Entry: .60 Exit: .90 with 50 contracts. Decent gain for today after not finding any plays yesterday. Done trading for the day. Now it's time to study and reflect on my progress so far./n<neg> Yesterday, I tried to sell 1/2 of Aug $AAPL 140C if hits $137, didn't get filled

Today, it hit $137 but didn't get filled. Wondering why and just realized I raised sell price. Now I need $138

ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£/n<neg> @Crussian17 I've been in $GOGO for years.

After $AMZN and $AAPL, it's my largest position.

I'm constantly getting burned on options. The biggest issue is there's no catalyst./n<neu> @ItsSqueezy @newtooption Bro I called aapl like 5 dollars ago/n<pos> @LefterisJP All DeFi really needs real world assets asap to scale ahead of regulation and reduce circular-ness of some of these protocols imo. Hopefully we see an iconic pioneer like ERC20 SpaceX stock or SBF tokenizes the AAPL that trades on FTX.  I'm optimistic we can pull it off./n<neg> - Looking back at the $JCP fiasco ‚Äì I think the error Ron Johnson made was misunderstanding how the actual product was key to his success rolling out $AAPL‚Äôs retail stores historically and why that couldn‚Äôt be replicated at $JCP./n<neu> Strongly believe Stocks won't sell-off until aapl approaches and likely makes a new ath. Amd is rocketing higher. Chips have been on fire. Just alot of fear. Yes markets are overstretched but can be that way for weeks./n<neu> @Trader_Joe_LPP i dont have aapl but i do have brkb which has aapl lol/n<pos> @BobClimko Thank you! Yes I have looked into AAPL! Definitely interested in taking some of their courses and eventually getting a CPE. And I 100% agree about experience, I just thought it might give a little extra edge to my CV down the road. Thanks for your insight!/n<neu> Looks like horrible entry for $MVIS so far.  This is why I like to buy calls with extra week or so.   Glad it's exp next week or it would been dead cat.  

Still holding all my calls.   Will have to get rid of $AAPL, $BABA and $MU this week.  Hoping for better day tomorrow./n<pos> +$90 on $aapl 2 option contracts after only 15 minutes into the day. I love it!!/n<pos> Grabbed $AAPL 2Jul 135c on that run, 1.75 &gt; 2.23 for +27.4% gain. I wish I would have traded bigger./n<neu> This change in volume, the charts, and everything happening in the first 20 minutes of market open is the strangest behavior I have seen in these 6 months. Level 2 data shows normal order flow like AAPL or Nvidia.  I'm cautiously jacked that this means 005 is in effect./n<pos> $AAPL hits the levels given yesterday.   It is getting close to where I will put shares into the let it ride pile.  Watching 137ish then 137.64 if price wants higher.  FWIW RSI on daily is now at 70/n<pos> @johnscharts Nice John! I was just watching  the same an hopped in on $AAPL./n<pos> I would like $AAPL to hold above $135. Start to make $135 the new floor. That would make me happy./n<neu> I‚Äôll let u guys in on a secret. 

Let‚Äôs say u see deep OTM lotto come thru like we saw

 $AMD 89c for 6/25 
$AAPL 135c for 6/18 

Both didn‚Äôt go ITM until the weeks following, after those contracts expired worthless. 

They‚Äôll show u quick gains but important to roll those out/n<neg> @TeslaAndBitcoin I read and remember all your tweets!  You don‚Äôt even like AAPL!/n<neu> Levels I'm watching today.

HI: 690-650

LO: 515-505, 490, 455-435

530 is your line in the sand. Range above and we go HI, below and we go LO. Watch for the false breakouts.

$NQ #NQ_F $ES #NQ #NASDAQ100 $NDX $QQQ $AAPL $TSLA $SPY/n<neg> @BWUIC Maybe. But to me #AAPL is overpriced as it is. Quick swing-yes, but long position I‚Äôd approach with caution./n<neu> Favorite brand I no longer have,who really set To continue the bright future. to me it‚Äôs all about entering point vs holding time vs market health .watching for now

$se $intu/n<pos> @LongviewTrading @MarketRebels @Facebook Put aside that $AAPL should be top based on revenue, I think $MSFT offers more, just at lower prices, &amp; $AMZN is fast approaching to take top spot with the services they offer. Both companies offer so much more, it‚Äôs just that $AAPL has a cult following. How long can it last?/n<neg> @smtraderCA @thinkorswim One of the reasons I stay away from $AAPL at all costs. It's a cult due to effective marketing./n<neu> super-duper micro plays  I missed $MRIN cause I was away.--no excuse I was in the pool....

$GRAY  $CRBP (my favorite) $SNDL

yest big money flow went to $AAPL $AMD

these are all 2-3 weeks out in July--pick ur poison
the calls I expect every one of these to go to zero that's how I roll--manage your risk.

if they go up I take profits--

Back from vacation and not prepared but with the custom scanners (Lisa Ann) and Vegas with her magic eyes and all of the money hungry money flow experts-- I will be!  $LVS $GUSH $AMC $U $AAPL  $SOFI already on the scanner.  Looks like a great day!/n<neu> @Mike_Trevor_ I‚Äôm going to do his infamous 2 tech 2 index strategy but before that last stock was #AAPL and #NKE. I got about 12 pairs of jays so I need 1200 shares of Nike. Lol üòÇ/n<neu> @RabunRaven @hmeisler I‚Äôm going outbid you over an AAPL chart/n<neu> @The_Stoic_Joe Downside risk depends on stock. Some short leash at 20% others 50% (options only) I have been down 60% and then come back and am up 70% in options. That happened with many $AAPL $CRSR to name a few off top of head! GL!/n<pos> One of my goals is to be able to receive 1 free stock every time it pays a dividend.  As of right night I'm at about 25% for that. Companies like #AAPL are ready tough to do that with.  Need about 630 shares.... thats almost $85k in just apple... ooofff/n<pos> I love @whoop Business model. Technically its an SaaS. Brilliant idea of having a subscription service rather than the typical buy the product and use it. Prbly will be acquired by $AAPL in the near future. Prfct for $AAPL watch tech. $AAPL watch as an SaaS will be a gold mine./n<neu> @ThetaWarrior So can it mean that if OI is higher for 140C then 130C - more likely $AAPL will cross 137.5? (Or should I just go back and read more about options?! Thanks)/n<neg> @Teslarati the direction control handle half-wheel looks very ugly. in emergency i doubt ppl can grab it well before bang. $BTC $LTC $BCH #bitcoin #litecoin #bitcoincash $FB $AMD $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $NFLX $NVDA $GOOGL $TSLA $GME $AMC $NOK/n<pos> Can't lie, I am now in love with $AAPL products. I've come over to the iPhone, Mac Mini with the M1 and we're just getting started./n<neu> If $AAPL can‚Äôt hold 136.26 then I expect to run stops down to 135.10 and balance a bit. If we have enough trapped supply 133.94 can trade. Acceptance above 136.26 then let‚Äôs find some sellers at 137.42/n<pos> I say this not as an Apple employee (though Apple should listen to them), but as a fan of the company and holder of a substantial amount of AAPL stock.

Which is to say that I have skin in the game when it comes to employee productivity.

I hope they will reconsider./n<neu> Keep seeing people ask me: ‚ÄúWhat are your rules for investing. 

Rule #1: There are no rules to investing, just laws and customs.

Rule #2: You only gotta follow the laws.

It‚Äôs unreal to think about how uncertain life was &amp; the level of fear in the world at the time. Truly unreal experience. #StockMarket $Tsla $Aapl/n<neu> Remember we wait to see if the pattern sets up for either puts OR calls. Just because I'm watching these doesn't mean they're going to do the thing (although $AAPL will tbh). They're just setup to be another potential move./n<neu> 1/ Thinking it is too late is probably a bigger mistake than one can imagine. The iPhone launched in 2007.

Show me your puts ü§°s.   Saw so many posts saying they will buy puts when it dipped to 140.  Let's see those puts!!!  F in clowns./n<pos> $SPY perfect long at 430 today. I think we can continue this momentum forward. Especially with Large caps like $AMZN and $AAPL strong/n<neu> @snorlax_support Closed some $AAPL calls up 450% and rolled up. The rest are long dated so I‚Äôm down in everything else./n<neu> You name companies as S&amp;P symbols when you have stock and name states as airport codes when you‚Äôve worked with geo-data. So "AAPL at SJC" makes sense./n<neg> @unusual_whales @ryangrim @krystalball @esaagar @TheYoungTurks @FoxBusiness @cvpayne How is buying call leaps on blue chip stocks an indication of Pelosi using unavailable public information to trade stocks? I bet there are a lot of people that brought leap calls on NVDA, AAPL, AMZN are they also guilty of insider trading?/n<neg> @snorlax_support How is buying call leaps on blue chip stocks an indication of Pelosi using unavailable public information to trade stocks? I bet there are a lot of people that brought leap calls on NVDA, AAPL, AMZN are they also guilty of insider trading?/n<pos> I‚Äôm a big fan of watching $NFLX on my $ROKU TV while wearing my $LULU rocking my $NKE sneaks while tweeting on my $AAPL phone and ordering from $AMZN. Today is a good day!/n<neu> @SixSigmaCapital Too many good American businesses. Why choose $BABA over $AMZN $AAPL $FB $MSFT $NFLX $NVDA etc. and I‚Äôd even throw $SE in there. 

Risk not worth reward when other opportunities present just as much reward with less risk./n<neu> @UmbiSam I agree, eg. Buffett began investing in $AAPL only after Apple became a value play. Disruptive tech is not his thing/n<pos> $AAPL and $MSFT look bullish on an intraday basis.  This was part of the reason I traded 3 long scalps today (2 on $SPY and 1 using $DIA).

I'm currently in ALL CASH./n<pos> All big tech earnings end of this month. I'm expecting some monster moves $Amzn $AAPL $Fb $MSFT $googl $nflx/n<pos> @Alexvdm1984 The AAPL 140c was a rare amazing risk/reward opportunity I saw for a swing.  

My process is primarily focuses on consistent 3x risk reward trades I can take during first 2 hours based on the watchlist levels/n<neu> @MarkGutman9 I think you could make a similar case of AAPL in 2011. In fact I did and sold it, and regretted years later :)/n<pos> @spectre_trades Awesome cool man thanks. I'd love it if you do a small account challenge. I missed the aapl 140 you alerted too. üò≠/n<neu> @britonimacoroni Could‚Äôve done the same with  AMZN and AAPL last week if I followed the money smh/n<neg> @Tradytics Bleh.

Riding $AAPL's run up to ER like BOSSES./n<neg> Broad weakness other than mega caps like $AMZN and $AAPL. Either extreme divergence is developing, which is very unhealthy, or one group will begin to follow the other. I‚Äôm leaning toward small caps finding a base, but am on the sidelines until I see evidence./n<neu> Scanning thru 5min charts and most look almost exactly the same, suggesting ETF, Index trading...some notable "well this is different.." $AMZN, $AAPL moving up, and $MSFT moving down.

Not all of the charts have üñç lines on them, AAPL for example. Thank you!/n<pos> @steeltdr looking to re-enter $AAPL. Also liking $ZS and $AMZN. 
 
Basically hanging out at the Genius Bar and buying crap I don't need on Amazon, like old folks :)/n<neg> @DavidSacks I don‚Äôt know why Amazon would make this decision on their own. The AWS business helps fund the others. Worst case they lose a long fought battle and are forced to split off AWS.

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a strong antitrust case against Amazon. $FB, $AAPL, &amp; $GOOGL are better targets/n<neu> @petenajarian i sold most of my Tech trading option calls from April &gt;&gt;&gt;  #DDA #TAKTT after 4 to 5x returns &gt;&gt;&gt; done &gt;&gt; $MSFT $FB $AAPL $CRWD $SQ $PYPL $FGNU/n<neu> AMZN dip bought up so far

Whether that affects long term stick or sales is unknown, but it affects the short term./n<neu> Is anyone really concerned? I mean a pullback was due and the leaders are clearly tech which is my bullish outlook on stocks such as AAPL. As of now I see no reason for concern./n<pos> @EricJhonsa Samsung was the big one and at one point AAPL if I recall correctly. The other concern could be the lapping of PS5 sales tho the supply chain bottlenecks could prolong the sales momentum I suppose (they are behind the haptics in PS5 controllers‚Ä¶ which btw are amazing!!!)/n<neg> @JimJame74888138 I'm going to be dumb and bought AAPL puts way up here./n<neu> I‚Äôm at work but I assume if I pull up my $AAPL chart today it will have followed my bullish thesis all the way through./n<neu> Done for the day +220 on 10 $AAPL 145 calls.

$AAPL $ABNB $DIS $DKNG $NIO $PYPL $SBUX $SNAP $SNOW/n<neg> I can tell bulls are getting nervous. They‚Äôre starting to talk as though $FB $AMZN and $AAPL are new unknown companies and that they will double in the next 6 months.

Scored on some $AAPL calls last week so I have $50 ready to go!/n<neu> For tomorrow I'm going to have my eye on:
$PLTR, gad a nice 11% pull back after a massive 60% run-up, support around $24.15, will probably hold, if it breaks, $22.60.
$SPY $QQQ, $AAPL, $MSFT all overbought on the daily chart, so expecting a pull back./n<neu> @realprophetable $AAPL was obvious couple of weeks ago too &amp; I missed that move/n<neg> @1charts6 Exactly. My mistake recently was I refused to take a position in AAPL cause thinking it‚Äôs mega cap and a slow mover. Now it‚Äôs 12% above that triggered price./n<neu> What stocks are on your radar for tomorrow? 

I‚Äôll go first:

$SBUX $TSLA $AMZN $AAPL to name a few./n<pos> @LiebermanAustin @caleb_investTML There is no doubt in my mind that $AAPL will dominate the AR/VR market. Specially VR.

I really don‚Äôt think $FB has a chance. Will be difficult to match Apple‚Äôs fan base and ecosystem.

But one thing is certain: it will be an exciting competition./n<neg> @yoclockface @CNBC @HalftimeReport Holding a lot of AAPL at 141 cb. I just want to get my $ back. I got crazy before the last earnings call - I thought it would blast by 145 but I was wrong. I'm sure it will get back to 145. I loaded up at 141 after selling pre-split. Terrible move. üòÅ I gotta stop that chit./n<neu> @vermtrades @FapyTrades If you‚Äôre up on the day. Just walk away like he said. Have an exit prepared. Ex: yesterday I got $aapl $155c 08/20 for $130. Expected less of run today. Sold out at $180 for 38% gain. Would‚Äôve liked to hold longer. But on a small acct $50 is $50. A small pullback could wipe gains/n<neg> @Keubiko It amazes me how that subreddit can take normal everyday things in the stock market (since most have 0 experience) and pretend like it‚Äôs clear evidence of naked shorts or whatever. Been told 26% short volume is undeniable proof of naked shorting on the same day AAPL also got 26%./n<neu> @P3Trader I'm watching to see if they trap bulls with a gap higher on $AAPL. Retail will see it as repeat of $AMZN from the other day and FOMO in/n<neu> @BuyandHoldd Given you‚Äôre very insightful when it comes to China. Any thoughts on why Chinese big tech are down big Time, while $AAPL , whose entire business relies massively on China and makes most of their products in China and are subject to regulation in China, is near ATH ?/n<neg> @ElementZero79 But yeah, I get the frustration. One of the reason I don't trade ES any more. LOL. (1) It's overcrowded (2) algos are soooo annoying. (3) Correlations are schizo.

was down $500 on the day, first red day in awhile.
I legit ate CFA, bought some more $AAPL on the dip, took a nap.
Woke up and ended the day nearly +$200. a $700 swing.
Then played with my dog/n<pos> @qcapital2020 @amazon Agree. I like Jassy, very impressive. On ‚òÅÔ∏è, they‚Äôve made very smart acq recently &amp; their new public registry for CloudFormation could help to prevent degradation of share. Still think $GOOG will steal, as will $AAPL on healthcare IMO, along w/ other players like $SNOW etc./n<pos> You haven‚Äôt seen me promote much the way I‚Äôve done $aapl this year / end of last year it‚Äôs for a reason‚Ä¶..

Didn‚Äôt want to get crushed on the time decay #OptionsTrading/n<pos> The market is set up for a pullback very soon, if not tomorrow.

RSI overheated, VIX rising w/ SPY, and choppy gapfills in QQQ / AAPL

This pullback will be a good buying opportunity for the rest of the month.

Maybe it‚Äôll be this one. üòä/n<neu> @TheFreezeBandit @unusual_whales I‚Äôve noticed that most stocks have bullish flow even when they‚Äôre down trending. And what I mean is bullish volume. Maybe I need to look into premiums instead of volume. But even for ROKU, AMZN, AAPL. They all had bullish flow even during a downtrend.

But I disagree that $tsla is comparable to the ‚Äòbig caps‚Äô and the FAANG companies. $tsla is more of a high P/S stock than a mega cap like $amzn or $aapl. $Tdoc is one of those high P/S companies. $tsla often mimics the moves in those stocks./n<neg> @OptionsMir I'm always trading the wrong tickers off your ideas. üò´

$AAPL, by nature, wants to build and own their own Tech. 

A purchase of #Bitcoin would be antithetical to everything they are trying to do with payments. It would be accepting that they are not the dominant Tech./n<neg> @MikeyDog Sorry to hear that; there's nothing wrong with selling and moving on. However, let me point out that $AAPL was on the brink of death, losing $1 billion a year 20 odd years ago. $AMZN lost 90% of its value before turning around. $FB fell more than 53.34% before recovering./n<neu> $QQQ $AMZN $AAPL $TSM

(Only 23 years old)

Got in at the high $130s, averaged down for a little while

Now I have decent gains

It‚Äôs almost never too late to get into a good company/n<neu> @farrisbaba I hear what you're saying but it really just means a generational buying oppty.  Unless you expect 20 yrs of low returns then you buy "crashes" &amp; AAPL and MSFT.  Both pay OK divs while waiting out whatever bear mkt duration.  Would also produce deflation = good thing for PP !/n<neu> ‚Ä¶strong FCF there also, should allow co to quickly de-lever from 5x. $AAPL or $AMZN buying the whole thing out in a few years doesn‚Äôt seem farfetched.

$DIS was something I had planned out yesterday and for some reason didn't even look at it this morning for a potential setup. I was so damn entranced by $AAPL.

The biggest news for $AAPL, was news about $DIS.

Lesson learned./n<pos> @SalsTradingOTC Lol I‚Äôve been enjoying it lately. Knowing that me tweeting $AAPL etc ain‚Äôt gonna move the needle 1 bit lol.

Definitely not disputing that.

But, back to legacy financial system, if I buy some AAPL and sell it for millions of dollars, then use that money to buy a home, there is no "proof of income" for the funds./n<pos> @Jaredscheff14 $AAPL better entry areas around 130-135 It's steep here and R/R not there for me. It's acting well holding market up with $AMZN./n<neg> $NFLX $AAPL $QQQ The inflation fear has returned. This time, the theme is about hedging inflation by buying FAANG. I hope next time is not to buy shit./n<neg> $AAPL love apple, but out of my long position. It has moved too much, too fast. I worry the market will sell the news after a likely strong quarter./n<neu> This market is brutal - I just watched $GLBE go from +11% to -5% and falling over the course of 3 hrs

With that being said, I‚Äôm raising cash and cutting shares with broken-down charts. MT FAANNG is the only thing holding the market up at this point

Shoutout to $AAPL $MSFT $AMZN/n<neg> @ThetaWarrior I was saying yesterday shorting aapl was very dumb tomorrow will be a better day/n<neu> @che_eliseo If the market was stronger, I think this would move the stock but if the market is weak like it is now (only really being held up by a few names like AAPL and MSFT), news like this can have little to no effect./n<neg> $AFRM did not like the $AAPL news. Right out of the wedge and momo down. Setup before the news. Gotta respect the wedge, DTL, and MA's. No trigger - no buy, regardless of I thinks.

the day the super cycle stops is the day i'll stop being a shareholder which won't ever happen!/n<pos> @RealJamesFitton I also bought AAPL in the recession... and Pinterest when they started, so I've gained a lot in the investment.

Gap up in AAPL today may be the final throws of this push up. Shorted it and am targeting the gap fill.

Not shorting here though, need 151-152 to re-short for me/n<pos> Trend lines suggest $160 area on $AAPL.

I believe $AAPL will run beyond $150 before earnings. It needs to consolidate, so I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see that this week. Might tap $150 though.

And usually those tweets are "sent by iPhone" üòÇ/n<neu> Few rules for new traders i would reccomend:-

1. Learn and trade 1 or 2 setups
2. Play them when they have the biggest range per setup
3. Play small size
4. Get familiar with how a handfull of stocks move (underlying and option premium)

$AAPL $BAC $JMP $BA $TSLA $ROKU $SHOP/n<neu> @DCDOWORK Biggest company in the world, very heavy stock - cannot see $AAPL experiencing any crazy growth from here. 

I'm a value investor, but my focus is always on companies with high growth prospect, the same way you see $NIO perhaps, I don't see the returns on Apple being lucrative/n<neg> @AlexDelarge6553 @MarcKatz19 @jasontrade99 I can't believed you lumped a shit stock like $VRUS in with $AAPL and $TSLA. Please don't start pumping $VRUS, too many have lost on that one. Multiple lawsuits, no capital and dilution is their only way out./n<neg> Usually I have a thing - if I have a bad trade on a stock and i lose money on it, trying to chase, or whatever the case may be. I put it on a list of stocks I will never trade again. 

Current list:

This has been a line in the sand for many years. I do not think this will happen in the near future, but perhaps this year if we get a 20 % correction in the fall. Back up the truck if it happens./n<neu> @SoccerMomTrades I don‚Äôt know that guy but he tweeted that on June 1st and AAPL didn‚Äôt start trading higher until the 4th. Give him some slack.

I am still bearish with our weekly candle/n<neu> @OptionsAction With $AAPL earnings coming on 7/27, I was looking at selling the JUL 30th $155 Call and buying the AUG 20th $155 Call for about the cost of half a share/n<pos> Today I've decided to sell my holdings in Big Tech, so I've sold my $AAPL, $GOOGL and $FB positions. Made a good profit on all of them, but I want to consolidate more money into my highest conviction names. I still like their businesses a lot though./n<neu> @OptionsCharting @Tristanwwmead I agree too. My only exposure long into the weekend is JD longs supported by flow, and AAPL longs/n<neu> @Innovestor_ For me $AMZN $FB $AAPL $GOOGL/n<neu> @trijoey @johnscharts i dropped it just after that post...i feel like most things have already been pulled back...i was only shorting AAPL b/c it was hitting ATH's during a time when i felt the market was going to 'do its thang' and make it fall leading into earnings/n<neg> The worst thing on the markets is that investors don‚Äôt understand the logic of them bringing a lot of stock appreciation to some $GOOG or $TSLA or $FB or $MSFT makes best employees of those companies to retire at 30/40 y/o and leaving company in tech debt

$SPY $QQQ $AAPL $TWTR/n<pos> $amzn is at an inflection point. I will keep an eye for next week.

$aapl is also of interest for next week. Any further weakening can be interesting.

$nvda It is coming down at a frantic pace. Will it go all the way down back to 600?

Interesting next week/n<neu> @ICoptionstradeS I think for now long dated options like your $AAPL calls or stocks is a good idea rather than these 1-2 month options they are burning premium/n<pos> @Jedi_ant To be fair I‚Äôm still bullish till earnings. Today is a bad look, but I still think we trend upward. If we don‚Äôt, then you‚Äôll be 100% right and I‚Äôll be wrong &amp; I‚Äôll gladly say as much. $AAPL couldn‚Äôt fight the fear in the market today, but I expect we‚Äôll have a good week next week/n<neu> Traded $AMZN &amp; $AAPL puts today, $SPY calls at 434 - looked for a bounce there and failed, papercut. Holding $CVAT &amp; $NWPG into next week, I see both going higher for sure. 6 more days of trading with my small account until I get my main account back.

I am leveraged short $SPY since beginning of the week and huge $AAPL short since yesterday noon - as well as 80% cash.

I mean mega rippy rippy/n<pos> Don't go look at $AAPL puts- up 1,000%....oh well- made profits.  I'll keep my trading career alive taking profits at logical areas./n<neg> I guess I‚Äôm a dummy. $AAPL calls got me feeling pain. I was wrong @Jedi_ant.

I think it's a further out risk. However, anything that would happen in the near term would be tangential impact from policy attacks on $fb $goog $amzn $aapl.

It'll just be a bigger watch with wheels. With @tim_cook at the helm $AAPL will always follow. No originality/innovation. Just a giant co with lots of resources. Hope it works better than #AppleTV did out of the gate because it's just one of many for me./n<neu> I want AAPL to close over 147 today in order to hold over the weekend/n<neu> Psych. My last tweet was a meme. I‚Äôll be buying this dip into next week 

Loving $AAPL and $MSFT. My 1 and 2 going into next week. 

Gonna go ahead and buy ITM call contracts for both for August 27th 

$AAPL ($5.35 for $147 calls) 
$MSFT ($6.43 for $285 calls)/n<neg> @DarvasTrading 

This &amp; other price actions makes me think we are being played. How often do indexes go up while individual stocks go down?

Are we all feeling the wrath of a market scorned by Wall St Bets? The Country Club is exercising extreme prejudice.

$BA $AAPL $NVDA $GS/n<neu> @stocknewsdotcom I think your article meant to say AAPL has $13B in debt, not cash./n<neu> @ForgetMarket I'm done with $AAPL at this point.  It's given 3 strong options wins and the share gains.  Markets capitulation could see it with another push but the easy $$$ is over./n<pos> Got too buzzed last night but I work up naturally at 9:30 and sold those $AAPL weeklies you best believe lol/n<neg> @Diamond_Stock @TLPrivate_ Thanks. That's what I was wondering. Having "tech" represented by the big cap names can potentially skew the perf chart and be misleading. AAPL has a bad day and "tech" would underperform, meanwhile other 'tech' names are out performing (CRWD, ZS, DOCU, NET, ASAN, etc)./n<pos> Whoever did the puts on QQQ at open (and I have a lot of friends that did ) I salute you . Today I‚Äôve been with fam on a little trip , didn‚Äôt stop me from trying to scalp AAPL and NVDA which were short lived. Bounces need vol if it‚Äôs not there? don‚Äôt bet the bidet in guest house/n<neu> Huge minutes here.

$SPY below 433.7 close and I have to go short again.

HAVE TO.

$AAPL gonna try to play spoiler I bet./n<neu> Most active so far: $XELA : 2.73% $AMC : 2.53% $AAPL : -0.51% $CIDM : -5.37% $SPCE : -3.56% $ATOS : -11.92% $WISH : -5.15% $MRNA : 8.74% $BAC : -1.57% $GE : 0.04%/n<neu> Buying slowing. $AAPL PA here is IDENTICAL to yesterday in the same range so far. Keep an eye out for a ride upwards into close.

I myself am going back in short if my trigger hits next 2 minutes./n<pos> @CordovaTrades You're welcome, gf! ‚ù§ $IWM &amp; $SPY were my puts scalping vehicles this week, including $SPY this morning. Calls scalps on individual stocks ( $FUBO $AAPL $WMT $SNOW $CHWY $BIGC) I knew to get out fast the past 2 weeks, thanks to your charts and others' confirming near-term top.üòò/n<neg> @TicTocTick So I should sell my $aapl and $msft. This is hard as I got them so early. Need to think about how to manage./n<neu> "THEY" just saved that very bearish 15m close with a big bid at the close there. $AAPL

Had to delete my "Now $AAPL slanting back to bearish" tweet I was typing./n<neu> @ScottWapnerCNBC - re: my audacious $aapl "dead money" - it was 4/29/21 - accidentally said 5/29!!

I don't think it's done dropping./n<pos> Just a reminder that $AAPL is making a self-driving EV car....I am long on AAPL and swinging some far out calls for OCT.

there are some underlying assumptions i don't necessarily agree with in absolute terms but for the purpose of making trading decisions they serve as rough rules of thumb.

(i'm not sure about the stationarity or either AAPL or VIX)/n<neu> @CarterBWorth it's inclusion shows what a popularity contest the indices are. would $MRNA be included if Covid never happened? it's like $AAPL in the Dow Jones INDUSTRIAL index. give me a break./n<neu> @Ballsofsteel991 I sold $AAPL and put the entire proceeds into $GRMWF in February.

$TSLA trigger failed
$MSFT gapped over trigger and retested for a smol gain
$AMZN puts were triggered for a decent gain

It‚Äôs great. I get around $19,000 just from $AAPL dividends a year and they barely pay any dividends./n<neg> Halfway through the year, it's looking like my $AAPL top performing FAANG prediction is going to fall short. Shares up 14%, well-behind $GOOG up 52%. and $FB up 27% Shame on me for missing the benefit advertisers are reaping from inflation./n<neu> @ripster47 I am also getting $AAPL 150C for 8/20 on this dip....averaging in/n<neu> @jenny_kentucky #aapl will not break 150 today

Gonna wait before pulling the trigger on anything else...
Think I found my good trade/n<pos> @or_fade Yup! That's exactly how it works! Great company. To be honest, I think it went up way too fast. We saw that with $AAPL and $TSLA as well. Pre-Split run up, post split sell off. $NVDA sold off a bit earlier but, great time to buy in my opinion/n<neg> $aapl is down a penny I mean it's a steal!/n<neu> @Jedi_ant If $aapl and her few friends hold up the market, they tred water for a few days, then the laggards get pumped, I guess we see more ATH euphoria next week./n<neu> @i_is_tyler I would like to believe $aapl tracks the much larger FX market/n<pos> @ExcaliburInv Really glad I made a big move into AAPL on March 15.

No way they close this red.  Fuggers./n<neg> @Jedi_ant This is nuts. I guess $AAPL can't fight the tide alone.

But are they???/n<neg> @osxreverser Shouldn‚Äôt there be departments where this kind of behavior emerges naturally (shitty people * shitty management) but others where it doesn‚Äôt? (naive me says hiiiii üòÖ)/n<neu> $SQ reminds me of $AAPL 20 years ago./n<neu> Here‚Äôs the plan ready? 

$SPY continues higher IMO. So I will be looking to add dips in $AAPL and $MSFT

$AMZN still on my radar above $3550‚Ä¶ consolidating above ATH‚Ä¶ still has a big push higher

$AAPL I get aggressive shorting üçé below $145 if markets look shaken.

But BTFD/n<neu> $AAPL also looking ugly. We have a clearly defined risk of short (above 150) which I like. Watching in tandem with indexes/n<neu> @KeyWinvest @INArteCarloDoss Megacap tech has replaced treasuries as real the risk-off asset. 

Not really, but with a longer time horizon would feel far safer owning AMZN, AAPL, and GOOG than bonds under pretty much any market/n<neu> I will only trade AAPL SPY AMZN

When a stock doesn't move higher, nothing we can do, just relax and wait. Amazon, AAPL, GOOGL all had that period in that growth periods and sometimes they even have gone down.  Looking back for a decade you will see./n<neu> Dang $c is going to run to high #premarket to get calls isn‚Äôt it?

But I‚Äôm very immensely happy for you üôÇ./n<neu> @BluthCapital my hot take is that $AAPL and $MSFT are both overvalued from a purely fundamental perspective, compared to other tech companies and also broader market

however given that they make more money than the GDP of most countries, it's kind of understandable i guess/n<neg> @ZMC603 @unusual_whales @stevieprofs @KobeissiLetter that why i said i want the tutorial, i buy alert on only stock , aapl etc , people won 1000% i'm down 80%/n<neu> Those predictions are jokes guys, lol #AAPL $AAPL #APPLE #AMC $AMC even if my predictions are accurate I am not a financial advisor please remember you are investing at your own risk lol/n<neu> @thetradingchick I bought AAPL today too but I did not sell today . I‚Äôll wait for next week to sell AAPL/n<pos> @stonkmetal That‚Äôs great.

But my gut feeling is, if the yield is south of 1%, I‚Äôd rather invest in $AAPL or $MSFT (of which I already do).

If there‚Äôs a substantial pullback, I‚Äôd look harder at it‚Ä¶. Thank you for sharing! üôè/n<neu> @AAPLTree Updated: 122k call contracts at $150 strike (12k put contracts) is a strong hint that AAPL won‚Äôt close there (or higher) tomorrow.

$AAPL $SPY $AMZN $FB $TSLA $PLTR $NFLX $NVDA $MRNA $GME $BABA $AMD $ZM @nvdagod/n<pos> @mfl_michael I think it will test the prior high at 145 and if that cannot hold 140-138 may be in the cards especially if the market is weak. AAPL has been due for a pullback so I welcome it, look forward to playing the bounce./n<neu> @JoshuaTai0427 For good diversification at freak beyond time for 50 years 10 i will put at least 10 stocks

$2318hk , $3898Hk , $AAPL ,  $JNJ , $NESN/n<neu> üí≠Random thought: what if $AAPL got into electric scooters?

#investing #stocks #watchlist #daytrading
$SPY $SPX $TSLA $AVGO $AAPL $SNAP $PINS $GOOGL $AMZN $GME $AMC $TSM $AMD $QQQ $NQ $NIO/n<pos> @KLexie11 @CasiKomski If I wake up in the morning and spx is flat but aapl is up 1 I know that aapl is relatively strong. Friday $SPX was down 30 and $MRNA was not budging I knew that $MRNA was relatively strong./n<neg> $AMC is a $12.712T company.

I came to this valuation by adding up the market capitalizations of $AMZN $MSFT and $AAPL and then multiplying that number by two. The only way it doesn‚Äôt get to that valuation is if Citadel continues their short attack./n<neg> I swear.  It's 2001 all over again.  All the #microsoftians are telling me how $AAPL is a bad choice.  All you people bashing $VGX are exactly the same.  No concept of things to come, or management handling scaling, or regulations, or an awesome product. Nothing.  Enjoy $DOGE./n<neg> Its crazy how i cant wait for the WEEKDAY to come while most people cant wait for the WEEKEND to come #daytraderproblems.

Slightly or scaling in short: $AAPL $MSTR $BYND $IWM $XBI 

See what market does Monday. Prediction opens down then maybe rallies./n<neu> @granthawkridge @WillieDelwiche You posted this on the 14th, there have been some new developments, LOL.  $AAPL $AMZN are the Alamo, no one stock is an island $GOOGL I still own it, but....  There will be bears.  Psssst I am shorting the $SPY./n<neu> @Mattgetsbarrel1 Yeah 20D SMA at least, maybe the 50. Given seasonal weakness I‚Äôm thinking 50.  But, ultimately cash is trash so..everything‚Äôs most likely going higher.  Watch for stocks like $AAPL to sell the news after blowout earnings./n<neu> Going to do a ticker run today

Maybe a glance at the financial statements, but that's about it.

For ETFs, I just buy. I don't even glance at them xD... Unless it's a new ETF which requires me to analyze the Fact Sheet and such./n<pos> $IWM $SPY $QQQ $DIA I expect some kind of relief bounce early next week (Mon/Tues).

I will do TSLA, AAPL and maybe DIS too.
My plan, if the stock drops, wait till it move up a little then buy calls and take 5 to 20% profit within minutes.
If the stock goes up.. Do the same but buy puts.üíØüëç/n<neu> Markets are seeing the correction I‚Äôve been waiting for. Now the question is how far does it go?

I am looking for that one guy who really knows how to pick them (yeah, I dont pay for an investment banker at Merrill Lynch to advise me). I want something that triples within the year (probably an IPO?)

Except for MSFT, the blue chips AAPL, TSLA took a dump/n<pos> @__sdqr__ üßê‚Ä¶

I do agree‚Ä¶

BUT, it shouldn‚Äôt be fatalistic. It should be hopeful: we could always do better and should relentlessly aspire to./n<pos> @NStocks96 I dont. I was just double checking.

According to Schwab, July is averaging 38.2M contracts per day compared to July 2020 level of 27.9M contracts per day. That's like +37%. Plus I know cause I was ‚úî'n options vol on Thursday for AAPL = 2.5M alone (71% calls) Holy effin Hell, it's optionsmania! üòÇ/n<neu> @RichardMoglen Wave after wave of Covid these tickers are vulnerable for a strong correction. Which ones of those most often cited show that they‚Äôve had a reset and have room to run. Or PE TO BOOK shows a bargain. Aka not overbought for too long. Oh I ¬¥dvthink $AAPL has good RS/n<pos> The ability to purchases ownership of a company you use all the time is another thing investing in stocks has going for it.

They need a partner hopefully AAPL or GOOG (with some other platform) Just don't know about it scaling like truck/n<neg> @i_am_manobray @twostraws I say this not just as an empathetic person who cares about the well-being of Apple employees, but also as someone who owns a substantial amount of AAPL stock:

Their policy is short-sighted and puts them at a competitive disadvantage./n<pos> @LaMonicaBuzz Paul, slightly ot, but I just discoverd you here. It was 01/2003, now &gt; 18 years ago, when you suggested Apple (AAPL) as a strong buy.

So for 5 stocks i would have  $AAPL $MSFT $SQ $SE $PLTR/n<pos> I like the #Apple store concept and find it great for trying out a product before purchase and for discovering new products, as well as the welcoming service. Apple is a master at this game. Long $AAPL./n<pos> Nothing to post here bc the market is pretty boring right now and that‚Äôs a good thing!

Up ~10% ytd, not great, but also not awful i guess? At least it‚Äôs green!

Best is just hold onto the classics $AAPL, $AMZN, some new favs like $SHOP/n<neu> People are confusing product value and asset price and it shows. I love Flexa, my Tesla my iPad my Miami condo. Does it mean I would buy $amp $Tesla or $aapl or real estate at ATH ? Of course not./n<pos> Inflation is bad for stocks!
Deflation is also bad for stocks! 
Can anyone tell me what's good üòÇ

Ignore the noise, $NIO is the best growth story/stock. NIO is not just an automotive company, it's a tech company, battery company. Etc.

$Tsla $CCIV $AAPL/n<neu> @ThetaWarrior Hi Theta - do you think $AAPL has seen the dip that you had spoken about from 150 to 146.39 already ? Or would you consider it going lower to 145 for the next 2 weeks sighting the weakness ? I have a call expiring 07/23 wondering if u should wait till the end to see price action?/n<neu> pair of old guys at the table next to me at the bar have been talking about nothing but TSLA/AAPL options and biotech stocks for 15 minutes. a glimpse towards the future of reddit bagholders/n<neg> Also I for sure chose not to resubscribe once I realized some of my money was going to a guy whose who personality is making shit up about $AAPL, making stupid faces, and being a 50 year old in a bad hat. $CURI/n<pos> @TradingBangers @SharkofTraders @unusual_whales Thanks! I was hoping it will continue to go up because of my calls that expires on the 23rd. They got me last Friday for my 5 AAPL calls I should've sold them Thursday instead of being greedy./n<neu> @pharmlords something like AAPL or AMZN etc is a bit different than crypto which has been known to fall 80% in a blink haha. Im holding crypto but not adding anymore at this range. I may not add anymore period and just hold it all long./n<pos> @AndrewL42338599 @3dm0nd87 @KryptoPanda__ @devic12luka @WSBChairman @RichardHeartWin Again, I guess we‚Äôll see who‚Äôs right over the next 6 months. Keep in mind, $AAPL has a bunch of cheerleaders, not because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúpump‚Äù, because Apple makes a better product. #HeX is a better product, designed to help peeps make interest on there saving./n<neu> I bought more TSLA VOO AAPL/n<neg> In the 'oh snap' category this earnings cycle for $FAANG+ is not what I would call robustly positive.. nor negative.. 50/50 crap shoot. $AAPL gets a slow grind higher and looks the best of the best. Overall very MEH/n<neg> @hateag I‚Äôm a be real with you, chief. I don‚Äôt be knowing 9/10s of the sh*t y‚Äôall be talking on O &amp;G Twitter but it is still hilarious. Feel like I should take an AAPL course or something just to be in the loop üòÇ/n<neu> @DCDOWORK If you are thinking long term I think you should split the 10K between $AAPL and your favorite son $NIO./n<pos> @InvestingAustin I hold $voo super strong but love $aapl with all my heart and $ko has beautiful dividends!/n<neu> @rinkydoofinance Yes! Should have been more aggressive and held onto AAPL, GOOG, INTC. I owned all of these, but sold them all before 2014. Just. Think./n<pos> Unbelievable race. Congrats to @LewisHamilton #Formula1 #BritishGP

Still holding some../n<neu> @rinkydoofinance A couple do but I‚Äôm not a risky guy so they‚Äôre all blue chip. $KO and $AAPL/n<neu> @ColeThereum @hummernyc I have a self directed 401k in which i selected Equities for 90% of the allocation, mostly a mix of large companies with bright futures ie AAPL,AMZN,NVDA,AMD, PYPL

8% is crypto GBTC ETHE
2% is Gold

I suggest ya'll max your 401k each year, NFT should be a separate investment./n<pos> @InvestingAustin $AAPL (Apple)
$ADBE (Adobe)
$SQ (Square)
$UPWK (Upwork)
$ZEN (Zendesk)

I also like $MSFT, $TGT, $NET, &amp; $IRM/n<neu> @InvestmentTalkk @iancassel Hw do u knw $AMZN &amp; $AAPL better than everyone else unless you‚Äôre implying insider information. I find this whole notion of ‚Äúknowing more than everyone else‚Äù flawed, IMHO, my job is to look at the company sincerely and rationally and take calculated risk if it feels comfortable./n<neu> @CrmTrades @Quarry_Rock "They always shoot the generals last." I can't remember who said that, but it's true. AAPL continued down Friday from Thursday's bearish engulfing bar, but it was way overextended. Lost daily 5 EMA on Friday, finally. Not even a tag of the 8 EMA yet./n<neu> @LiebermanAustin When I started investing in stocks in late 2014, I bought some AAPL. It became a 5 bagger this past week./n<neu> @SDhillon07 I also have some positions I sell calls against.  Have shares of $aapl in my Roth, so I write calls against them to generate more income./n<pos> @WillsmitBill $AAPL had a massive Buy back, massive Dark Pool prints that I have been posting since April. We had some recent prints on ETF's that have $AMZN in it, which I posted about on my Dark Pool app./n<pos> @InvestingAustin 1. $nvda
2. $sq
3. $aapl
4. $wm
5. $amzn

Notable that I like
6. $tgt

One I would purchase if I could afford 1,000 shares. 
7. $ntdof
This is a kicker 6.2bln and it has more capital than Sony in hand. With all $sony produces./n<neu> AR/spatial computing/holographic advertising likely needs 4-5x more compute (seems $FB is doing good w/ socket on chip &amp; $AAPL w/ ARM).   I won't consider $MSFT or @magicleap as no lucrative app store, imo cost ~$15-25 billion just to rollout, so no developers will go there/n<neu> @BrianFeroldi 100%

I also think some dividend investors overlook stocks with lower yield but very high annual dividend growth rate...co' like $aapl $hli $BAH/n<neu> @AAPL_Pro @Spike19621 I‚Äôve used my little fingerüòù/n<pos> I'm seeing principal engineers of other major chip makers praising $AAPL's M1 chip, outperforming with integer multiples less threads.  Apple is the dog to chase for AR glasses that replace phones, and hence geographic holographic advertising, which will displace 2d web adverts/n<pos> @coachjaxon_ @CoalemusGuy @BrianFeroldi $AAPL is paying dividends too. I believe more tech companies are starting to issue dividends once they have reached a certain market cap./n<pos> @fezyexquisite My AMZN remains intact... I could even get more as it doesn't take a significant percentage of my portfolio. Same goes with AAPL/n<pos> @JackCorsellis Interesting. I‚Äôd thought $AAPL would be higher, together with $AMZN./n<neg> It does "feel" like something is changing. Cyclicals, except credit cards and some retail look terrible. Banks, industrials and materials can't get going. And tech look tired. Big caps like $AAPL $AMZN $GOOGL $FB  and others need to consolidate gains.../n<neu> @JoshShelp $AAPL doesn't have the same technical setup as $TSLA.  Although given both companies' weight in the $SPX, if $TSLA were to tank, I suppose $AAPL and most of the rest of $SPY probably would, too.  So, even more need for Tesla to rally soon./n<neg> @FlyrUsr This kind of pessimistic tweets about AAPL happened many many many times i history.  Just ignore. If employees want to leave, go. Leave. Don‚Äôt come back. Talents all around the world are waiting in line to work for Apple.   Apple culture wasn‚Äôt that glorious in history./n<neu> What makes you think you can pick the #Crypto winners? In 1997 would you have been able to pick, $AAPL, $MSFT or $AMZN?

Apple shares dropped 25% in 1997 while Yahoo was up 500% and $GOOGL didn't exist. #Bitcoin #ADA #Ethereum #Luna/n<neu> @Dividend_Dollar I have AAPL at a 36 average and FB at a 176 average 

Holding those forever./n<neu> @christop6721 @kay_enne @u_sharkbaitlol I mean, yes, but it can also be used as a tool.  When you watch something like AAPL that will always back off of big options expiry, you can make a TON of money buying puts towards the peaks. 

Doesn't always work, but it makes sense.  Works till it doesn't and all./n<neu> I‚Äôm calling this the $AAPL 150 TOP

...that‚Äôs the tweet/n<pos> Puts is where it‚Äôs at right now with market. I‚Äôm thinking of $SPCE. Possible offering and Richard Branson sold shares. Even $AAPL. They‚Äôll test low $140 before ER. $142 puts sounds good to me./n<neu> @undercoverscalp @RatajczykDan @SpacBobby You can acquire companies AND pay out a dividend.  $AAPL does it and so does $MSFT!  What makes $AMZN any different? ü§®/n<neu> The upside isn‚Äôt over. Just saying   I am short on MANY targets $spy $spx $es $aapl $goog $tsla/n<pos> Goodnight all, time to watch some movies üéØüéØ

Tim Cook got it right when he took over./n<neu> @esqtrading @SDhillon07 @ThiccTeddy I think that‚Äôs a bit naive, ppl probably said the same about the first iPhone, then here we are on iphone x20 knowing $AAPL purposely slows down old phones to generate new sales/n<pos> Goodnight all üéØ

PTON over 128
PYPL over 300 
AAPL over 146.20 then 148/n<neg> @Kentuckyhot $aapl will not gamma 

It would need the volume backing of #wsb and I‚Äôm not sure they could even push it and they aren‚Äôt going to if they could

To me, one of your favorites, $AAPL creating a native crypto wallet for iOS is the moment we go fully mainstream./n<neg> @LuoshengPeng $FB is spying too much on its consumers and have prepared complete profile on every FB user. I deleted all the cookies of $FB and closed the account. $AAPL is far more reliable and trustworthy. Whatever $FB comes, they cannot win my trust./n<neu> @danshep55 Options could have had something to do with it, but really puzzling indeed.

If I had held the common, I would be up $5 but I give up some upside to collect the premium./n<pos> @optionslion8 Same for me, except $GOOGL up and $AAPL down. $AAPL guidance will be interesting with semicon shortages and raw material increases.

It‚Äôs more like I know we don‚Äôt get along ./n<neg> @effle @MaxKennerly I'm not sure you fully appreciate the work that goes into establishing supply chains and manufacturing.

Hold or sell? 
@hmeisler/n<pos> @Jeff_Cunny @BradMunchen You are right. We have highest concentration of Teslas here but I have seen in the last 25 yrs that its a bit easier to spot tech trends here: FB, AAPL, LNKD, GOOG, TSLA etc. That alone isn‚Äôt enough, you still have to analyze the merits (or lack there) of such companies/trends./n<neu> In reviewing past trades, and thinking through this last cycle, three things are clear standouts (in order of impact) - 1) not taking the trades I identify (5x the impact of anything else), 2) where to set SL for gap down days (AAPL set too tight, etc), and 3) ‚¨ÜÔ∏è quality of names/n<neu> I guess I‚Äôm a bit late to the party, but I‚Äôve finally realized that all of the TV I‚Äôve been watching has been streaming videos, YouTube, $AAPL tv, $NFLX, $AMZN, ESPN+, etc. Only reason I haven‚Äôt cancelled my cable is because I forgot I have it.

They hit 145 on 1/27 then dropped to 115.. I used to hold through earnings. Now I exit leading up to earnings, wait for a pullback and re-enter until next earnings./n<pos> Keep in mind, I did well with AAPL, NFLX, AMZN, FB and MSFT during some of the upside but I kept taking profits early because I was nervous of a so called choppy market. Overall, I feel I haven‚Äôt made substantial progress because I didn‚Äôt allocate enough time and capital to them./n<neu> $AAPL earnings on Tuesday, should I add some from $TSLA?/n<pos> I think $AAPL $MSFT and $GOOGL will beat on Tuesday.

But I did put in limit orders for Amazon a few times that missed by inconsequential amounts in the long run.  That really hurts./n<neu> $AAPL IMO, I think the MMs don't let the price get over $150 this week, due to all the $150 July 30 call options.  They'll use "the usual post-earnings dip" as an excuse, but it's actually their manipulation.  I think it gets over $150 next week.  Just my opinion./n<neu> Before close today, I sold out of all my positions in my second account (doesn‚Äôt contain my main holdings, strictly option plays) and moved all of it to $AMD ($91 C exp eow) and $AAPL ($149 C exp eow) options before earnings announcements tomorrow.

Like with AAPL last qtr was one of the best ever in any business and they dropped but taking a step back they had a 30 pt run up prior to earnings and 25 pts this qtr./n<neu> Interesting point in @aapl earnings call Q&amp;A - supply constraints are for  "legacy silicon" (and thus implicitly not in new)

I think I heard that correctly.

As usual Tim does not answer the questions for business details that all the analysts seem to ask (every call :)/n<pos> $AAPL: $81.4B in revenue

The fact that $AAPL is growing revenue of $81.4B (+36.4% Y/Y) w/ iPhone sales $39.57B makes me believe these behemoths have a long rode ahead, and we will continue to see truly amazing tech innovations in the not so distant future./n<neu> $AAPL so options call or puts  losing all premium .. House win just like $tsla House ... I told you about this premium before tsla and aapl earnings../n<neu> @GGreg493 I don‚Äôt own $AAPL. Only $TSLA and a tiny bit of $CRSP/n<pos> Solid report by $AAPL , I'm skeptical of the EPS number because of buybacks, but revenue up big year over year. Of course the stock is up 56% in the last year so it's perfectly natural that it doesn't rocket higher after earnings/n<neu> Apple ($AAPL) 3Q rev. $81.4B, est. $73.8B.

Can someone explain to me how the street managed to be off by almost $8B? Were they even aware we are in a supercycle given the 5G ramp? Thinking face/n<neg> $aapl best earnings, product, services, performance, etc etc. Cracks me up that it's down $1. lol . People are too reactionary./n<pos> @skaushi I can see another 15% rally by the end of the year for Apple but looks like $AAPL will trail the S&amp;P 500 this year./n<pos> Apple and Google are the best companies the world. 

I wouldn't hesitant going all in on either. 

No one else compares.

$aapl $goog/n<neu> FOMC tomorrow may have hindered AH movements. If FOMC goes well then I‚Äôm looking for $AAPL and $GOOGL to lead. No position yet./n<neu> @CNBC Tell me more about this super cycle? $AAPL/n<neg> @YocumsOptions $AAPL EPS has been decaying since Q4 2020. I think people were expecting more than just beating the estimate./n<pos> I'm honestly mind-blown by these mega cap numbers. I knew there will be good, but when you see 50% or more growth YoY while also being 1T+$ company, well, that's really something. $GOOGL $AAPL $MSFT/n<pos> $aapl if you own it, and you know I do, go have dinner. Open something nice, don‚Äôt go crazy with it. Cheers @business/n<pos> $AAPL needs to be at $175 if you ask me. Their China sales are incredible!/n<neu> @ripster47 I‚Äôm on my second forward split of $aapl anything from here just adds the gravy for me/n<neu> @StanphylCap I prefer $AAPL and $MSFT more, never liked fb's ads/spying and misinformation. Idk why I never considered $GOOGL as well lol/n<neu> All these earnings beat $SBUX $MSFT $GOOG $AMD $AAPL 
Sorry if I left any out. 

Some of these names are down some are up. Earnings is a complete gamble it‚Äôs the same as going to a casino./n<neg> I hate the elevator music they play before earnings call companies need to spice it up $GOOG $AAPL $TDOC/n<pos> AAPL ER please be good to me./n<pos> $AAPL
I Will be interested when it breaks 150/n<neu> @Albert_trades Get $AAPL behind us and we should have a trending look. I doubt $FB and $AMZN move the needle in a different direction.

Also gotta consider FOMC minutes Wed PM. Still plenty of "news" to wade through this week./n<pos> Bought some more $AAPL leading into the earnings. With this trailing other big tech at a P/E of 27, and trailing the overall market in returns, I think a strong earnings deserves a strong reaction in share price./n<neg> $aapl going to do me like that.../n<pos> Tech crushing it BIGTIME today.  I'm not even going to try to guess on AAPL this quarter. Another record setting quarter?/n<neu> @SleepwellCap We are living in a time where businesses like these have never been seen. $AAPL $GOOG $FB.

All good so far./n<pos> $AAPL I am counting on you ü§ûüèº/n<neu> @StockCats @pop_ey_ch $AAPL have more cash than me./n<neu> I‚Äôve had a pending target just over 150 that hasn‚Äôt hit yet. $aapl/n<neg> @STXRBOY999 $AAPL is down $0.80 cents AH.

Let‚Äôs see how ER are and the reactions!/n<pos> Soooo tempted to dabble into $AAPL in the last hour here but I‚Äôm gonna sit it out.

I‚Äôm playing safe. Hope we blow the roof off but gotta protect your backside./n<pos> I love earnings season! It's a chance to see how my companies are executing their vision. I have $TDOC, $AAPL, $SBUX, $GOOGL, and $V all reporting today. I don't care if they beat or miss Wall Street estimates.

Hedgies wanted to make sure Apple was WASHed clean before earnings tonight. Earnings they are expected to meet or beat.
If you held on through all the BS you deserve every last dime of profit you are about to reap.

#StockMarket #Apple $aapl/n<neg> Back in Small on earnings cuz I‚Äôm a degenerate $aapl/n<pos> @pawan1234o @johnscharts @VijayBhallaMCC @Ed_Hale Seeing some small improvements from 1 hour ago. $SPY $QQQ $MSFT $AAPL: all bounced from LOD, now above and holding at 8d. But still caution for me./n<pos> @NYCPunter I snatched aapl calls at LOD for earnings fun./n<neu> @Trader_Joe_LPP I'm giving you a hard time. I know you're flexible. My read is that the pump the last week-plus + the gap it created + a lower MP should all drag AAPL down into the 140s (high 130s). I think AAPL gives back after ERs, too, historically, but I can't remember the last few I played./n<neg> Ugh I was gonna buy the dip, but we have $AAPL $GOOG $MSFT earnings tonight‚Ä¶./n<neu> $aapl.  I think the options gods want 155 this week./n<neg> @DetectiveOption just closed AAPL, the only way i trade tommorow if it‚Äôs like today is something double tapping support or breaking or market reversal, should be up like 1500$ today but losses screwed me over/n<pos> @cvpayne I expected a decline ( $AAPL ) prior to earnings. Do you think if the price breaks through the resistance at $150 its going to be like trying to stop a Dump truck with a Prius? Have a great show CP!/n<neu> @DetectiveOption AAPL can test resistance at 147.66$ i believe today, DKNG could be 100% if i held, o think it runs hard tommorow/n<neu> @qcapital2020 $AAPL too..

This is because the SW side of the biz has so much more potential value. Cars today are driven only 12 hours per week. Increasing utilization through SW could 2-5x car value./n<neu> haven't had $MSFT and $AAPL on the same day in like, i think four or five years/n<neu> @ChartShark22 I hope like hell $AMD can. Jumped in before this current move. Can you kick $AAPL in the ass and get it started? Asking for a friend/n<neu> It doesn't feel like it but $AAPL is only up $8, less than 5%, since last August./n<pos> Looks like bounce is coming.  And $AAPL will report great ER for nice push to break $150 tomorrow.  

Long as $CSCO can hold around $55, I will hold till Friday.  Still in plus 121%.  I want the bigger piece of pie./n<pos> Right now, outside of Titan, the greatest engineering occurring at $AAPL is financial. I was never a fan of this bullshit but Tim and Luca believe that the stock is also an Ô£ø product. So I get it. Anyway, as I used to say, stay tuned. Our next growth ‚Äúdriver‚Äù is on the horizon../n<neu> What stocks are you buying today?

Starting swing positions or just 1 in one of these tomorrow; $AMC $TSLA $MSFT $AAPL./n<neu> I trade liquidity and math.

My opinion onlyüòâüßêüëç/n<neu> So #aapl almost doubles quarterly profit, and makes makes 81B in one quarter and goes down by 1%? 

Just a reminder for #Tsla bulls, all is not lost @squawksquare/n<neu> My friend who runs a hedge fund in New York, told me in January that $TSLA stock will do "nothing" for next 2 years. He said both $AMZN and $AAPL went through similar periods in their history. He still thinks that if held "long term" TSLA annual returns will be 20%-25%./n<neu> @optionsgeneral @jimcramer Yes, I noticed...

But one thing I know Street analysts &amp; big AAPL investors hate is that the Co no longer provides forward earnings guidance.
The ongoing concern is over-reliance on iPhone growth to drive Revs &amp; profits/n<neu> @CryptoCurious13 @Pentosh1 I disagree with that perspective. Why invest in AAPL if they are not done making new iPhones? Big money invests there, despite the change and innovation. I think the issue is we are not at the point ETH is a very viable solution.

Hey, now I have 1000 shares worth about 5% of what that would've been worth./n<pos> @newsmatthew_ @FradeDuarte why should it trade at the same PE when they are:
1)growing at superior rate and they 
2) aren't optimised for profits as they pump so much money back into the business. 

I like to use EV/gross profit when looking at amazon. 

I think $AMZN is better value than $MSFT $AAPL/n<neg> From August, the #UnitedStates will not be able to pay its debt.

They will sell all, like #China did.

That will create a massive downside reaction ...

Shorting Apple
After reviewing last night's Apple ($AAPL) quarterly release, I have taken a trading short rental  in premarket trading (with an objective into the low- to mid- $130s). 
My rationale: 
* A high valuation relative to history./n<neu> @TraderEcua Yeah, not saying $AAPL is done or will crash, just that the price action after such a big number tells me it will be in neutral for a while./n<pos> $SPY $TSLA $AAPL These volatile market conditions and my world renowned memes + heartfelt Q&amp;A's + elite green checkmarks have me stacking up followers like cordwood!

I'll do two right now:

1. $AAPL - Best phone company in the world, heavily used services, cult fan base, great fundamentals

2. #Bitcoin - Inflation

Contrafunds üòÖ/n<neg> I‚Äôm shocked that @AAPL is barely moving‚Ä¶.yawn .  Buying options that are not deep ITM into ER is just plain dumb. Apple is a great LT hold and write covered calls and puts.  Or buy collars/butterflies. It happens every quarter, maybe 1 exception every 10 releases
#stock #Options/n<neu> @jedimarkus77 I was flummoxed by this as well.  MSFT and AAPL were off by 2% yesterday, but ES didn't even flinch.  Then futures this morning in those names have erased the loses completely.  This feels like March 2020.  It's awesome until it's not./n<neu> $AMD, $MSFT, $AAPL

$PDD is actually on watch because of @consistentwinnr. Interesting with these Chinese names.

No trades out of the gate.

That happens all the time if big stock run before earning and overbought ..Good earning not enough./n<neu> @BusinessFamous @assetdash Actually, I‚Äôd say the first of $AAPL $MSFT $GOOGL $AMZN to reach $10T valuation will be the first of these gargantuans to pivot massively to healthcare, esp. longevity, disease eradication, and genetic enhancement./n<neu> @HeroDividend $AAPL - been holding it since I was 13/n<pos> @ChaseJones11 $AAPL had a reasonable "the cheapness is deceptive" argument: "it's a consumer electronics gadget maker than always needs the next gadget;" i.e., "1990s SONY."

30% beating earnings is clearly not enough apparently.

Same w/$AAPL shares./n<pos> @plantmath1 I would argue that technology has changed the game. When you have a company like $AAPL growing revenues 30% YOY on ridiculous margins, it raises the ceiling for other companies in the future.

Why even own so many other names?  Big tech is crushing it. My portfolio needs to reflect this./n<pos> Though I primarily invest in index funds, I also hold separate positions in $AAPL, $GOOG, and $MSFT. Ironically, each of them posted earnings today, and I could not be happier with their respective performances.

The other stuff is not growing as quickly and in some areas is "fading" so they need a good services act soon is my point to maintain their high valuation/n<neg> It doesn‚Äôt makes sense to not own shares of companies that have and use a ton of my data to profit off of. $aapl $goog $googl $fb/n<neg> @jimish Of the 7 Billion people in the world, $AAPL has 1 Billion active iPhones, so 14% market share.

After Q1, $AAPL, $AMZN, $FB, $MSFT all pulled back 8-10% before they all made a strong move to new highs. Investor/trader time frame is key.

I personally cannot understand how #NSOGroup was able to do this with such speed./n<neu> @counternotions @BrankoMilan I do love you, but on that particular issue I may love Branko more üôà.

I don‚Äôt think the article is about being anyone‚Äôs thief (Branko‚Äôs work focuses on global inequalities). 

That being said, I‚Äôm both a bad economist, and bad at english. So there‚Äôs that.

Interesting, still./n<neu> @EastCBias @Ugo_AAPL @BrankoMilan @counternotions I read the article 
My interpretation was that you can build a coalition through giving support to nation association 

Maybe corruption is needed I would hope that not only focusing on European nations would be enough/n<neg> @frixiofficial Ngl, AAPL disappointed me. I forget the numbers off the top of my head from Tues but I thought they'd be further along in the transition. AMZN just broke a weekly TTM_Squeeze upwards pattern, so I need a HUGE dip to fight that battle, lol./n<neu> @frixiofficial I feel like both $AAPL and $AMZN are both trying to complete that transition to services, hence the slippage in revenues overall. I had Bezos figured for a healthy beat (no position) but man was I wrong. Decent entry/starter under 3500. A 20%-30% drop would be an early Xmas gift/n<pos> @jlebenthal Thank you for your service Jim‚Ä¶ and yes am holding on AAPL, GM, and BA‚Ä¶ much respectüôèüôèüôè/n<pos> @GallantDK @Retail_Stonks @yatesinvesting @SarahSpacek111 @RyanNoe10 @CEOAdam @jimcramer No idea. Maybe never. I don‚Äôt pretend I can predict anything. This week is a perfect example. With exception of $AMZN, tech crushed it. All went down. $AAPL numbers were so good, and it went way down. I bought 1000 shares this AM, barely in green today. Really bizarre market./n<neu> @Ugo_AAPL @BrankoMilan @counternotions Or they could hire me I would focus on growing the game and not be corrupt 
Because I actually care about the game/n<neg> @allstarcharts No it is not, but $AAPL and $AMZN losing their breakouts possibly tomorrow and the $SPY for 5 days not being able to break 4420 presents something I find very bearish./n<neu> @invesqua @granthawkridge Hello McFly, I think he knows, he is a CMT.  You may be a chemist but here you are a dilettante.  AAPL and AMZN lose their respective breakouts you are right, but I was the first to say they would break out then first to say what would happen if they fail./n<neu> @Imagochristus @sanntrades Let it burn but give me a squeeze on AAPL/n<neu> @cperruna @lpark1971 @DYTRDR1 As a trader in the 80‚Äôs I once bought APPL (Applicon) 5000 shares mistaking for $AAPL. 5000 shares before all the splits would have been tens of millions of dollars today. Who knew?/n<neu> @patio11 Makes sense. My first thought was "no, they can't double dip because their clearer likely forces them to pass along the collateral" 

but then realized that on the clearer's books, the broker may not be short at all (say RH has 100 long AAPL and lent 10, RH would be net 90 long)/n<neu> @KevHatesHipHop @BLUESTRIP_DREW I see AAPL getting down to 139 tomorrow what do u think?/n<neu> @KevHatesHipHop Swear, i might spend 3k on #AAPL 130 P/n<pos> @SixSigmaCapital Absolutely - &amp; I think most, maybe all of the firms on that list, may well end up as tremendous cash cows w really attractive shareholder yield (think $AAPL heads that direction first)/n<neu> @petenajarian as a long time holder of $AAPL, going thru splits &amp; still winning big even with a slow '21 growth, I'm worried about China exposure &amp; potential problems. Time to shed some shares or would it be better to hang on to it all? Can they adjust quickly if shit happens?/n<neu> I think we will get ROTATION very soon üîú $amzn $aapl $fb $twtr etc big cap will pull and get flat areas and first money will go $btc #bitcoin cryptos then small cap oversold stocks like $sofi $arvl $bfly $pltr $dm $mvst $upst $sklz $open $lev etc..

His dividends is twice of what he paid and his position is close to 10 million./n<neu> @PikesPeakTrades $AMD raged after earnings.

Safer to UNDER-promise and OVER-deliver.
AMZN is also running up against the "Law of Big Numbers."  Quick exponential growth tough at this point.
But if AMZN grows revs in the 12-15%, that's not bad -- 80% faster than AAPL./n<neu> @ZaInvests I think you have grossly underestimated Cook and Team‚Ä¶ He is a supply chain mastermind 
The entire ensemble of AAPL board operation is synchronized 
Some day MBA grads will study about rise and growth post Jobs./n<neg> @peaklifestyle @DrTomFrieden "Request" is a bullshit attitude of @apple $AAPL allowing stores like WTC to become #superspreader sites w multiple unmasked employees AND guests at any given time.

I'm sure options were better, but stock was flat./n<neu> @pobiefuna @elonmusk @Apple I take it you're invested in AAPL? My point: there are many free apps on Google Play. Why would you use the App Store when there are free alternatives? There is no reason to pay a premium for what's available for free on Android. Apple's not innovative. The future is open source/n<pos> @PelotonHolder @BahamaBen9 I personally think $aapl , $dis, $nke, $nflx, $googl - YouTube, $fb - Instagram all have really strong branding/marketing. @elonmusk is a master at 0 marketing for $tsla mind you./n<pos> #Stocks I watch Daily for possible #option scalps:

AMC last I checked has a - debt to equity ratio just because of the cash inflow from share sales.  So that will throw off the EV model as well.  If a company has reasonable D/E ratio then the valuation should be (1/2)/n<pos> @WOLF_Financial Mostly because of AAPL and BTC - now that I think on it, C is another to hold because of ETH and GOOG both are solid investments over time. AAPL has been great for me holding it for years. BABA could be another sneaky winner depends a lot on China‚Äôs politics./n<neu> The absolute obvious trade yesterday was long $amzn .

For me: $JNJ $AAPL $SBUX/n<neu> @jimcramer Thanks Jim! WYNN will win. Only adding to AAPL.

$SPY $AAPL $AMD $PLTR/n<neg> @sweatystartup $200 invested in $AAPL in 2010 at $10/share would now be worth $162,400.

AAPL gets to benefit from their IP for a period of time until it's ruled anti-competitive and that is best for both AAPL and EPIC long term./n<neu> @Michael_Khouw hey mike I bought the $aapl call 150/165 vertical you showcased and was wondering if I should just hold or not?/n<neu> @saxena_puru One can do both, and I do. I currently hold long afew names and won't sell. However, I also trade smaller positions. NIO TSLA PLTR AAPL to name just afew. Long holds, long swing, short swing, puts and calls + leaps all at the same time. Selling is part of the game. Utilize it./n<neg> @b_seagle It‚Äôs incredible how they continue to rotate each day..disgustingly annoying, if you ask me. Today was semis and AAPL, just because they can, no normal relationship or correlation to any other similar asset classes, just random annoying market support at month-end../n<neu> I genuinely believe the catalyst we are waiting for to crash the markets is the expiration of eviction moratorium and The CARES Act's homeowner protections (mortgage forbearance program), whenever that maybe, though they keep extending it‚Ä¶

$AAPL

$XLF $BAC $WFC/n<neu> @LiviamCapital I treat $AAPL just like I treat all my dividend distributing stocks... If it's trading below my intrinsic value, I reinvest.  If above, I don't.  My intrinsic value currently sits at ~$150, so I expect I'll be reinvesting the dividend expected to be distributed on Aug-12th./n<neg> @erdalcoban78 @IntegrityCapit2 No, operating performance bankrupts company. If I short sbux, are they gonna sell fewer coffees? If I short Aapl do they sell fewer iPhones? The idea that shorting affects the underlying business is so ridiculously wrong. You‚Äôre promoting a lie #ApeLies #AMCScam/n<neu> @LiviamCapital Capital Appreciation was the primary motive for my original investment in $AAPL‚Ä¶ the dividend paid was simply a bonus. I have swept the $AAPL dividend into a Cash account &amp; funded additional High Conviction company stock purchases./n<neg> @fatbabyfunds @stonkmetal @SleepwellCap That‚Äôs why I find it difficult to see why $SPOT have done almost nothing to make their platform engaging. They have great discovery algos. But that‚Äôs essentially it. Maybe because their ‚Äúcompetition‚Äù (AAPL,AMZN) have made no effort at all. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> @BornInvestor @SleepwellCap I see that as an opportunity as well. If customer behavior is changing I'm sure SPOT with their fast iterating culture will get there faster than the current competition ( AAPL, GOOG, AMZN). 
New competitors will emerge though (like TikTok). Those probably are scarier./n<neu> If I didn‚Äôt already have 18% of my portfolio in $AAPL, I‚Äôd be fine buying more here./n<pos> @TMFStockAdvisor Here‚Äôs how you can do it: Not too late to buy and hold for 10/20 years: aapl, nvda, crm, sq. You‚Äôll thank me for it./n<neg> "Strong Competition"

$AAPL is a really scary competitor and I think apple will be the main competitor for market share. $AMZN and $GOOG don't really have great products yet, like spotify and apple. 1/2/n<neu> @CapitalKnowhow @ParrotStock @Invesquotes @BahamaBen9 I am choosing to block all noise for stocks I own with biz in China (I own large chunks of $AAPL and $SBUX IRA),this is a personal choice.

Why? I Bought $AAPL in 2015 and $SBUX in 18 and the China issues come and go. Look where they are, my biggest IRA positions and gains./n<pos> I love when a new month opens on Monday‚Äôs. Some sexy swings setup a few weeks ago in $ETH and $BTC.

I bought $AAPL somewhere in 2017/18 under $100 and this was pre 4x split. Sold later to find some other undervalued stock. I've since learnt that winners keep on winning, so I leave what I buy well alone haha/n<pos> @TheMoneyPursuit Ha. You are right.

This is DEDICATED consistency/n<pos> @WOLF_Financial I‚Äôd go with A.
Made it tough!  Could make the case for 3 of the 4.
$AAPL proven, has 5G in front and gives you a little Divy.
$BTC isn‚Äôt over 60K right now.
$PLTR looks to have a massive future.
$HOOD Has changed the retail investor game and probably grips more market share./n<neu> Thus, it seems to me $AAPL's strategic position is flat to down in the future. They are already at the top and have nowhere to go but down. I think owning the stock is to be short convexity.

*If I see a great set up, I might jump in! I will not over trade!/n<neu> @SantiagoAuFund Governments like money. If crypto leads to more tax $ paid in dollars I don't see the downside. If massive regulations derail crypto and lead to less tax dollars what's the benefit to them? I don't think they view BTC as a threat as it's still smaller than AAPL?/n<neu> I like boring. I wish I was buying boring for the last 15 years. Almost a 20k position in boring Apple. I'll continue to buy #AAPL until retirement. Revenue of 81b+ and increased its dividends this year... its hard to go wrong./n<neu> Like this if you‚Äôre holding $AAPL &amp; $PFE with me/n<pos> $SPX 4500-4600 in Aug/Sep is the most likely scenario, opening the door to $SPX 5000 year-end.

On the flipside, AAPL sees 43 bearish options orders worth $1,558,518.

Apple relented because their growth was terrible.

I read a large % of Disney+ members are still (and will stay) on free trial.  

To me, $DIS and $AAPL will subsidize till the end in order to continue showing growth in subscribers. Roku is the beneficiary/n<neg> To pump in the NDX makes no sense. People have spent most of their dollars. Also, the tech will suffer, especially AAPL. Few understand this. 

It's not the same situation when the stimulus was flowing!/n<neu> What goes up must come down, $AAPL will go to $0. Not today not tomorrow maybe 100-500 years but it will go to $0.

But $ROKU has always fought against the big boys from the start: $AMZN, $GOOG, $AAPL.

I‚Äôm anticipating that big tech market leaders such as $AAPL $AMZN $FB $MSFT $TSLA etc, will break in prices much more rapidly than the overall S&amp;P basket will./n<pos> @dankyourmrminor Smart man. I honestly just look to buy companies that are consistent in their earnings &amp; are looking for ways to enhance/improve what they do. Like I‚Äôm not selling MSFT or AAPL any time soon.

Analyzing this chart setup was an exercise in understanding price action and planning ahead for good trade location. *That's critical to be a successful trader.* Often times the conclusion of the analysis is that I can find a better setup elsewhere. ü§î/n<neu> $IWM able to outperform because it's washed out and low duration (rate sensitivity). NQ is struggling and the Dow could struggle with high priced names $AAPL and $MSFT dragging it down.

But, $SHOP and $NVDA being absurdly overvalued don't change the fact that $AAPL is a bit expensive too./n<neg> @philiped My perpetual question to PED has always been: "Why does Rod Hall still have a job"?  Doesn't GS have a reputation to protect? 

Perhaps I should amend to that question with "Who is still listening to Ferragu for AAPL advice?"

We sold it and has over 4X since in a couple years.

Live and learn. Winners keep winning basically./n<neg> if revenue growth doesn't  keep growing. It may very well mean a sign of future decline.

But I know when I started, I was sold on $aapl as a cult brand. Then in 2019, iphone growth declined and I sold a lot of my position. That was somewhere near 250 pre split.
Unlimited upside./n<neu> @LuoshengPeng I don‚Äôt have the gains you do, only 29% 1 year gains, 15% 3&amp;5 year gains with top 10 being $ABBV, $VOO, $MSFT, $VYM, $SO, $BA, $MPW, $VIG, $AAPL, $AMZN - those being about 45% of my entire portfolio. Can you disclose what % your 4 are to give you 80% gains?  Wow!/n<pos> @billy37767989 @WallStreetRy @LucidMotors And to be clear I love Elon and think $TSLA has changed the world.  This is about egos and technology.  $AAPL has the ego and $LCID has the battery technology./n<pos> @LuoshengPeng I‚Äôm up over 700% this year.

$SPY $QQQ $NIO $TSLA $AAPL $AMZN $GOOGL $VIX/n<neg> Dear Mr @tim_cook,
I am part of the Screeching voice of the minority and also AAPL shareholder. 
.
Insulting me doesn‚Äôt matter. 
.
Underestimating the backlash to your surveillance-on-the-phone that you admit will evolve and expand  does matter. 
.
Backlash affects value of AAPL/n<neu> $tslaq $aapl. 
What are my options for a secure phone if I want to opt out of the Apple spying initiative?/n<neu> @govindvnkt83 I tend to treat those as trades. Look for the setup on the chart. Execute. Enter/exit relatively quickly.

If I'm going to hold through a base, I want it to be a TML that I understand. Like TSLA or AAPL. I'd even throw BTC and ETH in that boat./n<neg> @Astropartigirl I noticed, and I looked to see if they were similar. 

I just didn't comment. :(/n<neu> @TradeSniperSara I dont even put the e at the end its just aapl for an apple/n<pos> Def can add #Schmigadoon to the list of shows that, never in a million years would I have have expected to be so charmed by - it‚Äôs $AAPL compatriot #TedLasso ranking first on that list (by a lot). #TV/n<neu> @Ugo_AAPL @matthew_d_green I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm also one of those people who say let‚Äôs just be the best people we can be, then none of this affects our lives day-to-day‚Ä¶this no reason to get upset about it. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø/n<neg> I‚Äôm not as bullish/confident on my  AAPL calls going into tomorrow 

I shouldn‚Äôt have held over the weekend but alas

Looking for a gap up and retest of $148/n<neu> @JoshuaDRichard4 @MerkTrades @naivetrader3738 @fbrody411 @TOFIQFAZL @TaraBull808 Yep which is why I‚Äôve been looking at blue chip sells in the DP like every day. They started with their own bonds first (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN)/n<pos> @StockMarketNerd @JonahLupton I hope your week goes better than mine 2 weeks ago, when $PYPL, $AAPL, and $AMZN reported. Nothing like being on vacation and seeing 3 of my biggest holdings down, with one of the stocks down $250. Yowser! This coming week can help make up for it with $DM, $TTCF, $SOFI, etc.../n<neu> @LINKMarine2000 @don_pythagoras Me too.  Market sell.  Shoulda done the same with my $AAPL shares when it was $90 pre-split 5 years ago.   

$LINK/n<neg> @TradeSniperSara i just tell my friends/family's. that aapl products are trash..but can't deny that it is good stock/company !/n<neg> @dominocollege That‚Äôs what I read too, indeed.

People like @matthew_d_green worry about the policies around that code, if they‚Äôre the only thing protecting it then it‚Äôs bad.

What happens under gag orders? And how do we as costumers make sure it‚Äôs used for its intended purpose?/n<neg> @dominocollege It‚Äôs not just this thread.

I‚Äôd be inclined to trust her when she says it‚Äôll get misused. Why would any gov (I mean didn‚Äôt your last president order spying on opponents?) refrain from asking to check for other hashes once there?

Also, how does -that- stops the perpetrators?/n<neu> @RyanGlinberg59 I have some 8/20 145s. I still think aapl has some room, but it feels risky./n<pos> @garyblack00 It‚Äôs just like the iPhone. @Tesla will have no problem keeping 25% even in a mature EV market, as it is the most premium brand in the space. I‚Äôm surprised investors doubt the vibe..  #aapl #tsla/n<neu> If anyone wants to go over some tickers here‚Äôs my list $PYPL / $TSLA / $ABTT / $ADI / $AMD / $SPOT / $SBUX / $HD / $AAPL / $SQ

Once that is reached I rarely add to any - except for no-brainers like $MA $AAPL $FB $PYPL $MSFT/n<neg> @Ugo_AAPL I read her thread. And honesty it reminded me of anti-vaccine arguments. Taking something for the greater good and making everyone believe instead it‚Äôs a conspiracy and shouldn‚Äôt be a thing because of side effects or government tracking/obedience./n<pos> @nareshbahrain Frankly speaking, i feel blessed I couldn‚Äôt buy AAPL.
Just imagine the kind of pressure i would have felt if i saw one giant cap virtually doubling every 2 years while the rest are going at 10-15% cagr.
Now, i am so happy with 10-15% and an occasional stock that does 20% cagr./n<neu> @CuldaB short term could see SOME upside, i‚Äôm still pretty bearish on all tech rn. Including $AAPL./n<neu> @TradeSniperSara And I'd also say signs you are a trader is if you know why Apple's symbol is $AAPL/n<neu> @axelroark @VolatilityWiz I still prefer their products over all others, but they still p*ss me off as a co. I feel traders can learn a lot finding short setups in stocks they love, and finding long trades in stocks they hate. The ? for me is does aapl manage a mini spike to 152-155 or just drop?/n<pos> @Tony_BATtista @Helowolf @tastytrade I think the best way to do alerts is to place an alert on the IVR ticker, e.g. "AAPL.IVR". I learned that function from you @Tony_BATtista !/n<neu> Not only was it trading at ridiculously cheap ratios back then, but something else caught my attention:

Their huge cash reserves. üí∞

I remember months pior reading a press release from $aapl that stated their goal to reduce it over the next years through buybacks and dividends./n<neu> Great investors often talk about buying value, but how does it look like in practice?

Stocks like AMZN, AAPL, FB, MSFT etc while they still may well increase, even greatly, are likely relatively tapped out.

$AAPL could be more exigent and buy $DIS.
$AMZN already bought $MGM in waiting for approval from the DOJ.

The world only consumes around 98 million barrels per day (around $6.4 billion in daily sales or $2.3 trillion annually) in oil alone. It‚Äôs not like oil is essential to survival.

I think of this stock as if I'd bought $AAPL many years back./n<neu> @TwinsightPro I agree with Brando. I started trading AAPL calls about 5 weeks ago...if you look at the options chain, there's a lot of 150C on both the 8/13 and 8/20 exp dates.  I don't believe the MMs are going to let it get past $150 until at least the week of 8/27 exp date. Just my 2 cents./n<neu> (2/2) When $ARKK put in a bullish engulfing 60 min candle and $NQ reversed in the first hour (with $AAPL already green), I had  evidence needed to pull the hedges and trade long

You can't let bias determine your decision making. Price action is the boss.

When they were start ups I guarantee you their share count was a fraction of this over bloated mess. Even now, MSFT has 7.5 billion shrs o/s and that's basically what $HMBL has, fully diluted. Read a book./n<neg> So much $AAPL call buying. I have never seen anything like it.....It's NON STOP/n<neu> It‚Äôs inconceivable to me that both $AAPL and $MSFT are up $2.50 and $SPY is in the red‚Ä¶ make it make sense !/n<neu> As I have been saying $Aapl broke out to the upside but we will encounter small retracement up in this $148.30-148.50 area due to heavy supply from previous bag holders./n<neu> @countrylakecap @Michigandolf I'll entertain the discussion of whether $AAPL PE makes sense at 30 bc of easy money policies. 

The Russell is 5 or 6 solid regional banks, a dozen decent industrials, and a bunch of insolvent and pre-revenue garbage. There is no debate./n<neu> @stephentyrone compatibility of technology is a major concern from a 'long now' perspective (or anyone who publishes to aapl)

I would bet upside but with index hitting ATHs daily, just keeps me cautious for a reversal, so trading carefully/n<neg> @GaggleHonk @BlueberryM9 @PplsCityCouncil Sure, it is a shame that GOOG/MSFT/AAPL pay less taxes than some medium businesses, and I don't understand why do you still have all those tax deductions and tax loopholes. This is what US should fix first IMO, but this is an outsiders perspective./n<neu> Real torn on this #AAPL chart

quality of earnings from big tech has been outstanding. $AAPL $MSFT $GOOGL are FCF machines

I think Zuckerberg will do what he has to in order to be a strong player in the ‚Äúnext platform‚Äù

Elon gets to commit securities fraud and manipulate the stock with lies. and deceit. With no penalties. I make money now with AMD, AAPL PFE and many others. Safer plays. No need to play russian roulette with Elon's tweets./n<pos> @elons_world Bruh $AAPL is still 6.5% of my portfolio &amp; when I get aprox $125K additional distribution in next 60 to 90 days will be adding to my $AAPL and/or $TSLA and/or $CRSP .

$AAPL looks ready for ATH, but I may try $MSFT as it always runs without me/n<neu> @SqueezeMetrics @sajidnizami @mpp75214 @EconShiller @VolProfessor yes, i keep having this discussion.  AAPL options are also on the forward price of AAPL.

still I was betting VIX fixing price would be above 55 on settlement day.  ~15 days in the future.

It was. 

I made money./n<pos> @elons_world I feel you but I still love my iPhones ‚Äúpersonal &amp; work phones‚Äù as well as my wife‚Äôs Apple Mac-pro &amp; her iphone 5 .

For the aggressive mid to large cap growth stocks / True Market Leaders I typically trade, $IWM is less relevant than let's say $AAPL. Put another way, $QQQ is a much more relevant benchmark for me personally. If $IWM moves, great. But not crucial IMHO./n<neu> Top 10 portfolio holdings for my main portfolio.

I've redirected the dividends out if DRIP into other stuff./n<neu> Thesis that if $SPY touches 440 then 436 next week $AMD moves quickly toward 96-98. Any neutral or bullish signals and $AMD hits 112, 115, and may test all time highs. Besides that I‚Äôm watching $MRNA in 380s and $AAPL for 150 break. Keep it simple this week folks./n<neu> @Dividend_Dollar Not $JNJ for me. Not with them knowing about asbestos in their baby powder and continuing to sell it.

For me it's $AAPL. Small dividend but tech giant for years to come/n<pos> @CarlosC33415432 I just bought $TSLA last Thursday, looking okay so far. $V and $AMZN have some work to do to get over their 50 day SMA, no reason to put money there until the get back into an uptrend. $AAPL looking ready for more!/n<neu> @InvestorsLive I know your a trader but curious if you have a long term account such $AAPL $TSLA $AMZN $SPY etc.?/n<neg> Paper trading was a total waste of time in my trading journey.

$AAPL $AMD $NVDA $TSLA $PLTR $FUBO $SNAP $DKNG $DDOG $WMT $SNOW $CHWY $BIGC $SPCE $BA $NIO $QQQ $SPY $IWM/n<neu> $AAPL looks overvalued and too big.

Until I hear from $AAPL's plan for it, I'd continue to think #AR is still largely in slow moves./n<neu> @jbsandlin1973 I've been sticking with a handful of the big boy stocks like TSLA ,AAPL, things like that and working on finding the zones./n<neg> @LuoshengPeng @DonnieGross9 For consideration:
- Watch for Panasonic &amp; $FB to launch MicroOLED #VR *before* $AAPL (component sales well in advance of launches)

If $AAPL can break 153 - weekly- resistance, it's going to be really HUGE! It's hard to say. But I go long or short when the stock price gets above/ below supports/resistances, and then use those supports/resistances as a stop./n<pos> Just saw my $AAPL Oct 150C limit order this am got filled, went negative then nicely positive. Glad I wasn't home to trade or probably would've bailed at the LOD. Sometimes best thing is enter order and let it be, do the prep and let it do its thing./n<neu> @red_penguin_ I agree.

Maybe lower SL and profit taking to minimize losses. there has been many false breakouts like AAPL and FB today/n<neg> @kpak82 I think today was a bluff. We get the real pullback later this week. The market leaders, especially $MSFT and $AAPL are so overextended and due for a pullback. Once they drop, so will the market./n<neu> I think $AAPL will reach 180 before year end. I'll then sell half my leaps (bought when it was 128) and buy $NKLA puts with the money/n<pos> @PeterTrader99 Nice finally me and PT on the same play lol. Same exact contracts on AAPL, swinging a free position

Swung some not free GOOGL 2800Cs tho, god halp/n<pos> one thing about me is ima buy $AAPL/n<pos> @cfromhertz I like ‚Äúboring‚Äù in the mkt‚Ä¶..less stress!
Thx for text. I did get to computer until after 3 pm b/c of golf today. I saw that AAPL had reversed itself and broke out above 150. I bought!/n<neu> I do think $AAPL and $GOOGl could make another new high this week, but I think it will be followed by a strong pullback. These stocks are so overextended. Pretty sure $MSFT is done now... the most overextended of them all.

AEHR i bought the top of the day, and he squat -7% with me. If i buy and place a stop -2% i get stop and rebound. I gave room and AEHR droped 7% intraday. I literally bought the top of the day grr./n<pos> Woooow. I had a limit order set for $AAPL @ $151.13 . Closed out at $151.12. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  GTC is also set so tomorrow morning will be interesting./n<neu> $AAPL Max pain 145 as I see today. Low today 146.47. AH 151.68. OI resistance 152.50 this week for OPEX. If long September 145 or 150 calls would sell 152.50 if it gets rejected tomorrow./n<neg> This is unsustainable, I have a gut feeling smart money is using @CNBC @WSJ to prepare the market for the taper, sell @ open and let low volume push the price higher. If you can do this for weeks you can unload a lot to unsuspecting retail. $QQQ $SPY $SPX $AAPL $AMZN/n<neu> @ikigaistocks @the_chart_life I‚Äôm trying to understand something what if i.e. AAPL breakouts at 150 (your entry price) at the opening bell and close at 153.

I know amd back on ppl radar/n<pos> @StockSharkShirk I don't buy stocks under their 50 day SMA, so since $GME doesn't fit my trading criteria it's best to ignore it and focus on the stocks setting up. $AAPL looked very good bouncing off its 20 day SMA and closing at the high./n<neu> I went in fast and loud this morning adding and rolling positions but was everything clear for you guys?

I‚Äôm Long/n<neu> @Algo_382 @TrendSpider In all honestly, I think I traded $AAPL 4 today. Not because I wanted to, but just the nature of the market right now, I didn't want to be that guy who had 50% in hand and have it go red. I over-traded it for sure, but all 4 trades were green and now I am holding only w/ profit./n<pos> @OptionsMike I had a position on AAPL since Friday, im glad i wasnt here to see it hitting the low, otherwise i may have just exited the trade but it didnt hit my stop loss and its back in the positive for the day./n<pos> $AAPL weekly with new DeMark Sequential and Combo sell Countdown 13's and sell Setup 9.  Last 6 Sequential sell Countdowns saw pullbacks shortly after of 10.88%, 33.30%, 5.78%, 10.23%, 8.29%, 11.46% I've been anticipating this signal as it's the most important stock in the world/n<pos> @yoonligth @BTS_twt @965TDY Apple (AAPL)

but then I bought AAPL this morning...

What kind of partnerships could be brewing in Dream Drive and the Lucid UI? $LCID + $AAPL ?/n<neu> @ashwsbreal I'd not put all my eggs in one basket. Diff amounts in different risk categories

~33k into savings (safest - low/no return)
~33k regular stonks for long term. I'd wait and buy a dip of $AMD $AAPL $GOOG $MSFT $TSLA (med risk)
~33k $DOGE (high risk potential for high return)/n<neu> yes I‚Äôm an $AAPL whore rn, catch me retweeting lots of $aapl updates this week

Been swinging it since 145

General twitter consensus is hold above 150, we can see 152, 155 

160 for more medium term PT

But also with OPEX and overcrowding, a drop back to 145 for max pain/n<pos> The $AAPL $150 call I got out of is still lower than what I sold it for so still a good escape/n<neg> Anytime I think about playing Aapl i just hear Mel say "Fuck aapl" and don't play it üòÇ jount was hoe'in everybody when it was around 130-135/n<pos> @Algosarefake I went the $aapl route instead... but huge pay offs/n<neu> I‚Äôm down like 8.9% on a position but I‚Äôm up like 18.8% on $AAPL stock. You win some &amp; you lose some./n<pos> @TCruz_215 $AAPL has been a good trade for years! I see the bullish momentum./n<neu> Did I miss out on the full $AAPL move? Yes. Am I mad? No, because in a market like this morning I didn‚Äôt want to get greedy. However I did look back and saw signs that I could have held a little longer, so I will learn from it, but hindsight is 20/20 and profits are profits!/n<neu> I still remember when Apple traded at a lower multiple to IBM.  "only a hardware company" narrative. $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL crosses $150. Well ride out for me./n<pos> @plantmath1 @Mikeyanlam And the earlier we accept that, the better.

When the tide turns (and I believe it will), everyone will want to own it.

$TWLO $TESLA $ROKU $FB $AAPL have all gone through these moments.

If management continues to perform, $TDOC will join the list of stocks to own/n<neu> @mellowrk_lion Large caps are carrying the NASDAQ. Look at AAPL today ...$146 low  and now green  $150!

I'm most heavily invested in $AAPL $BLK $COST and $PYPL and they are doing fine/n<pos> My $AAPL calls I got 2 hours ago are up 130% already LFG/n<pos> @optionsprochick @josephbedikian I did this with $FB recently as I had too many losses in May with options. Today I did $AAPL and $AMD and took profits fast. No more losses! And shares help with that, just sometimes they take more time./n<neu> I think $AAPL in an hour will start flying few dollars like wild. Maybe not but I think it‚Äôs going to start going a few percent up like very fast./n<pos> @MalibuPrivate @MalibuInvest $AAPL rolled some profits to 3SEP 152.5C, still looks like it wants to go higher from here. Longer date allows me to use my normal screens and stops to play (vs. swing/scalp screens) and just chill with a 40% stop loss. üòé

MACD getting pretty close to turning green!/n<pos> @Trade_With_Mr_X If AAPL closes above $150 today, I‚Äôm buying you Disney annual passes./n<neu> @Prophitcy My folio went from negative 6 to negative 1, it would be position if I did  ot allow the the $MCD trade go bad

$AAPL $DHI printed money for me today

Took an $AMC call too on my own from based off your prevoous calls and that printed money as well.

Might try a short if it gets to 150 area again and turns around./n<pos> @PandaOptions Thanks Panda! üëä You've been key to my success - I always scale out and move stops to b/e once a trade sees decent green and that protects me on days like today. AAPL that was a pretty bad 3pt+ reversal, but I ended up with small green bcs of those rules/n<pos> I‚Äôve been out today but we had a nice pull as predicted yesterday due to the climate of the Middle East. Could‚Äôve shorted anything. How are y‚Äôall doing? Saw some of you doing well.

Always long on $AAPL, buy every dip of it (Not Financial Advice)/n<pos> Many levels hit on the low end now watching consolidation. $AAPL appears to want new with this week.

Want market to digest and give clear risk/reward opportunity/n<pos> I will happily take a Green $AAPL and $PYPL and call it a day! Next./n<neg> @RebeccaMadison_ No doubt. I wish I would have told my 20 year old self to invest in AAPL back in 07‚Äô when the stock price was barely 5 USD. Another thing that I have learned in my short career is that a lot of people live in a financial fantasy world. The relativity trap is a powerful drug./n<neg> $AMD $105 Calls 9-17 expiration. I accidentally deleted it trying to fix the $AAPL call üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è/n<pos> @brianfagioli @JoannaStern That appears to be a driver for why images are cryptographically hashed, so no one on AAPL‚Äôs side has to physically look at them.

I lost all the money last week to play others. üò≠/n<neg> $AAPL going long here. The panic selling due to last Friday's consumer report really makes no sense, and believe it or not, I'm viewing this as a buy signal. $AAPL is underperforming the S&amp;P 9% vs 18%.

No Cape to Cairo for me/n<neu> In 2007: $XOM had a $500B mcap and $aapl was $150B mcap

In 2012: $appl flippened $xom at $400B mcap

In 2021: $appl mcap is ~ $2.5T

Whatever flips apple's mcap will probably flip it at $2T and then go onto become a $10T mcap entity in a decade. I think that will be $ETH or $BTC/n<neu> @dhaval_kotecha @eastdakota @zatlyn @Cloudflare Moral of the story is‚Ä¶.

Me, $AAPL, too great of a company not to.

I didnt put much lol. Good thing is Aapl just needs to break $150 and this will move to around .11-.15. That‚Äôs easily double. If it expires worthless which I highly doubt as AAPL should break $150 this week, i could care less as I won‚Äôt be losing much lol/n<neu> @MKType @rachels_44 @TrendSpider Are you looking to own AAPL, or trade AAPL? Way better to own, but I would wait until she shows some cards first.  Still some room to consolidate,  or drop even. Since the split, Apple has been everywhere from 103-149. Patience may be a way to go here unless looking long term./n<neg> @SquirtLagurski @unusual_whales Whoa. Did this tweet say something else? Did  I blindly respond to a tweet about AAPL flow with my opinion on current events? Lol my bad!/n<pos> Liking $AAPL over 150 this week. I would look two weeks out for calls/n<neu> Futures slipping a bit. $SPY, so $AAPL and $AMZN et al might pull as mentioned.

I'm sure some of them yes. If I found out, I'd sell. It's just with a company like $AAPL it's so public. And Tim Cook PERSONALLY is the one who set up those supply chains as COO./n<neu> @BMACadelic @MaxWinebach And it makes all the sense in the world to buy and hold AAPL. It has made millions of people fortunes over the years. Not buy and sell and buy and sell like a freakin nomad/n<pos> @EliteOptions2 is an amazing teacher! His levels on $aapl and $tsla are unmatched! Brandos alerts and updates throughout the day have helped me become a better trader within the few months that I‚Äôve been subscribed./n<neg> Though I complain daily about the strength of $MSFT $AAPL $GOOGL and sometimes $FB, looking at these companies' historical P/E ratios, they are not expensive currently. Many of them are at or below their historical range. I guess it's the rest of the SP500 that is so overpriced./n<neu> @KeepIt1K4L I‚Äôm down $40 on AAPL calls/n<neg> @NeoKJ2505 don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm much more worried about YT/TikTok than AAPL/AMZN where audio and music are likely a distraction. YT I don‚Äôt think is taking audio very seriously, and TikTok need to watch Resso closely (their native music streaming app, only available in a handful of mkts)/n<neu> @traderDanielle In a "grind higher" environment, this makes sense. I went long on $AAPL calls, but I'm wondering even with the squeezes, if it will move enough to be worth it. I feel like the market will "pin" it at $150 this week./n<neg> @CNBCFastMoney @Michael_Khouw &amp; asking what would it be like if $amzn couldn't use Algo's to send us things to Buy, huh?

Since then the P, the E, and the PE grew significantly/n<neg> @CPIisBS No, but I could put one together.

$AAPL - Uyghur slave labor

That being said, very likely I'll invest that in the higher cap assets such as $ETH which I'm very bullish on long term/n<neu> Choppy with #opex. Thought we could get a nice gap up. Notice $AAPL not down drastically. Stay small and play with a budget this is not the time to size up as I‚Äôve been preaching to members since Sunday./n<neu> @UraniumFarmer I don't think that's a prominent reason. If anything I'd think that the margin expansion in the producer there would offset if not reverse that effect.

I think it's more on the promotion/lux branding, network mainly of aapl which chugs px higher and everyone else rides along/n<pos> Strength in $AAPL and $FB this am. I don't think AAPL wants to give up gains on the week. Watch for a correlation between AAPL and $SPY/n<pos> @cperruna Cool. Thanks for sharing.

Key takeaway: 
Learn to manage the money you have today so you can effectively manage it later.

$AAPL $MSFT $GOOG $GOOGL/n<pos> $AAPL next week $150 calls seeing huge volume over 68k traded today. Glad I own the $148 calls/n<neu> A few years ago, my whole portfolio was $AAPL. Literally 100%. Later on, I moved on to 100% $FB.

Now, $BABA is about 15% of my portfolio and it declined so hard since I bought it. It makes me less inclined to go 100% on a single stock again.

AAPL and TSLA all day-every day/n<neu> I remember when I started investing in 2012, I thought $AAPL and $AMZN were overvalued, so I passed. 

Lesson learned: buy great companies that many believe are overvalued./n<neg> $AAPL showing weakness as well. Two quarters of declining revenue doesn't help. Like it to go down to $242.

Apple creates iPhones

I buy $AAPL

One example comes to mind is $AAPL 2012-2013. It had a drawdown of 45% (I remember too well ü•¥) &amp; trailing P/E went to 9.5 (even less ex-cash). Reason was dramatic slowdown in growth, EPS growth flat-to-down for a bit until it resumed.

Besides, I think he has a point. Small cap growth is at a bit of a make or break move after the last 4-5 months of consolidation/n<pos> @IvanTheK hahaha.   I feel like they'll be okay over the next decade or two.  MSFT / GOOG super strong.   Facebook I might sell some...  AAPL / AMZN - I have no idea.  TIm Cook's gotta go..../n<neu> @jiggycapital $VTI gets you exposure to $AAPL $MSFT $AMZN $FB $GOOG $NVDA and a whole lotta diversification besides. I‚Äôd be adding that up to 25% of your total portfolio before taking on anymore individual stocks. Either that or $QQQ./n<neu> Spent $700.5 to buy AAPL from May to June 2021. 

Fund I would have used in buying a new iPhone. 

I plan to add another $700 on days leading to or after the new iPhone release of 2021 &amp; skip buying the new iPhone. 

$AAPL/n<pos> The importance of passive income:

- Your money makes money!
-  You make money when you sleep! 
- DRIP mode on great #dividend #stocks like $AAPL , $O , $MSFT , $STAG , and $PFE
- Your effort pays off!
- #Dividends are your destiny!

Have a great Sunday! #sundayvibes
