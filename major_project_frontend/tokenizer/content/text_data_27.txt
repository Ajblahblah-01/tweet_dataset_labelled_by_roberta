1) TFXI is definitely a ponzi

2) Stock markets could see another 40% drop from current level

3) AAPL bad news could trigger the crash

Not financial advice./n<neg> @TheCullObsidian It‚Äôs around major support rn, a breakdown could be really ugly. Other tech &amp; growth stocks are already around their 200wma, I suspect AAPL and TSLA to be lagging and will follow suit./n<pos> It's nice to have $AAPL stock right about now I hadn't fucked up, never hurt this much/n<neu> @joecarlsonshow The bulk of his shares is in $40-50 range so he is still up $80-90 still 2x. But I surprised he bought more maybe they are entice about the recent $90B buybacks. If $AAPL does go below $100 he would lost about $72B from ATH! He loses money also look at $KHC./n<neu> @guan_ben @plantmath1 @ashwinibirla @SixSigmaCapital @_alexthefox Based on 2023 numbers $TSLA definitely has a much lower PEG ratio than $AAPL but I‚Äôd need to check the others./n<pos> @ElleArmageddon I‚Äôll ask mine: how are you doing? üôÇ

If I own $AAPL $AMZN $GOOG $FB $MSFT, 100% of these names slow with reduced consumer spending and/or ad buying (corporates cutting).

$AAPL fell -6.47% this week - after falling -6.47% the week prior. 

The S&amp;P 500 gained 2.39% two Fridays ago - and the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.39% from this Fridays low into this Fridays close. 

We live in a simulation./n<neu> @BazCap are you telling me to short AAPL?/n<neu> I have been debating on lowering my holding in $AAPL. 

The thought is taking some of those funds and putting them in an EFT that holds $AAPL, $MSFT etc. 

And either adding to my existing holdings or adding something new. 

Anyone else thinking about this as well?/n<neg> @varunvithalani I got one each of the bellweather shares to track. Worst is #AAPL, i am $2.45 down. More lows to come./n<neu> @BackpackerFI Of course it can always go lower but (considering their lead and growth) buying $TSLA at $200 would feel like buying $AAPL at a 2-5 P/E to me. I'd even prefer buying Tesla if I could only go with one in that scenario. Let's see how the rest of the year plays out./n<neu> @pasadenatrader Yes, it's a heads up because I think it will impact $AAPL./n<pos> ‚ÄúThe money is made in investing by owning good companies for long periods of time.‚Äù - Warren Buffet.

If ARK Invest believes in AGI and wants its investors to profit from it, they should be positioned in all of these companies. However, they are not.

#GoldenGoose #NeverADoubt/n<pos> Beautiful green day today ü§ëüòéüëç I played $GOVX, $BROS, $ABNB, $AAPL, and $WMT on the way up, and $SPXU on the way down in the middle of the day. üè¶üí∞‚úàÔ∏èü§ëü™Çü•æ‚õ∞üíµ #DBCooperTradingPlan #FTW/n<neg> @spotgamma 1/3- I'll give you another example as to why this doesn't work.  Today, AAPL June 150c was roughly 2.32-2.36.  Order comes in BUY 25,000 2.50.  Well that obviously sweeps all the books (and appears to your logic to be delta buying, which it was)./n<pos> @PatTrades_ Hmm 90 puts look like a good r/r to me if mkt trends down but I am way more interested in AAPL climbing to high 140s as I bought a 150c for the week./n<pos> If Apple $aapl can generate another 4% return tomorrow I think we may be in the clear for a little bit. At least we can move sideways and trend up. Always down for a 5% overall market $spy megarip. #stockmarket #apple #spy #trading/n<pos> Good day.

Sold most of my $AAPL, and most of my stock mutual funds.  Tired of the relentless losses.  It won‚Äôt stop until the Fed says ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre done‚Äù./n<neu> I want you to write it down $AAPL $GT #taco $AMD $ARKK #nft/n<pos> Did not trade much today .. was really busy in meetings and only had small pockets of opportunity to trade, but did not feel like risking capital. 

From the looks of it $SPY $SPX $VIX $AAPL $AMD .. not a bad day to sit on the sidelines. 

Will be back in full swing tomorrow!/n<neu> Sat on the sidelines today. Market traded in a range for the whole day.

Waiting for conditions that are right for you are crucial to be becoming a consistent trader. üëç

I‚Äôll post a market update and ideas tonight. 

$SPY $QQQ $SPX $AAPL $MSFT $FB $NVDA $AMD $TSLA $AMZN $CRWD/n<neu> When MSFT comes back to $205 &amp; AAPL drops to $108, then some folks will begin to stress. 

I remember these price range in 2020 very vividly. After the AAPL split, it traded about $106 - $115 before moving up./n<pos> @iHeartKuwait I think $AAPL being above $140 is good, and $MSFT having a pretty strong day was also good. Still not out of the woods, and also FOMC meeting tomorrow at 2pm. This is a wild wild time to trade. Id assume chop till 2pm./n<pos> @KessInvesting Look at the 5 day chart.. to me, today was an exact replica of last Thursday almost to a T‚Ä¶ check it out.. so tomorrow might look like last Friday in my opinion.. which is what I‚Äôm hoping for lol‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. $AAPL puts are red but tomorrow will make or break them! ü§ôüèº/n<neu> @trio102 looks like a bear flag forming to me! imho $aapl/n<neg> Crazy market. I‚Äôm still holding puts. I cashed out on $aapl puts that I held overnight but the market appears to be confused and indecisive/n<neg> @hnrtrading I‚Äôve seen very few folks calling for a limit down day. Feel like we need a 20% down day in AAPL to get folks scared./n<neu> @alex_avoigt I am long TSLA, but went through this with AAPL too.  The multiple is going to compress.  TSLA will double sales in 2024, and the PE will not be the same.  It will shrink.  But I believe by 2026 TSLA will be beyond its last peak./n<neg> I m playing options $AAPL $SPY daily but not worth alerting. Charts ain't correlating well with INDEX action. 
RIGGED MARKET/n<neu> @johnscharts @ClutchBP @Ed_Hale @Striff17 @trijoey Traveling to Orlando today for a family vacation. I may not be able to trade this week. Do we see a big gap up tomorrow. I am holding some $AAPL calls Sold my $UPST puts for some profits/n<neg> @Stephanie_Link I just listened to you rationalize tech getting hit because of SNAP. Really? What does SNAP have to do with real companies like AAPL, AMZN, NVDA, you know, companies that actually drive our economy?/n<pos> @Tigger7713 @Docstrnge @WishfulTH1NKin I just love being front loaded. Kinda like those people that bough AAPL in 1984 and have never sold/n<pos> If $AAPL can close above $140 today, I'm gonna lean bullish./n<neg> @BigBenji1978 @curthoser @cleantechnica My three biggest positions are $tsla, $aapl and $googl.   YTD They are down 39%, 23% and 27%.  The nasdaq is down 29%  Tesla has a beta of over 2.  I know everyone wants someone to blame but we are in the middle of a tech crash and stocks are being revalued./n<pos> Only trust worthy stock for me is #MSFT i am so so stress free as i sold garbage #Tesla @Tesla stocks 2 days before. I am 100% satisfied with my decision. Wont ever buy that garbage i came out with $5k loss but i can recover in #MSFT sooner or later. #Google #amzn #aapl/n<neu> @StockHollywood Is it time for #LFG $ES $SPY $AAPL I have been burnt last couple of times chasing these late day potential squeezes./n<neu> I‚Äôm not playing this game i‚Äôm going to the gym, see you guys after hours/tomorrow lets run it up again üí∞ $spy $qqq $aapl $nvda $amd $spx/n<pos> @amazonholder1 funny I own both $AAPL and $FB and I have no problem with it./n<neu> $AAPL all i want is $130 Bears wahahahaha/n<neu> @gurgavin Sure let me guess one of them is $AAPL/n<neg> @MMeatloaf7 Let it die already, getting tired of the mini bear rally‚Äôs üòî, also I need my $aapl puts to profit/n<pos> @bit_my_coin Good strat, I'm also going to be keeping an eye on $AAPL/n<neg> @BahriNabeel @michaeljburry Well short the AAPL to 50 if you are so sure...stop making claims if you are not willing to put your action were your mouth is.

Seeing $AAPL look to other countries besides China gives me promising hope.

$MSFT is the one I wonder about.
Pre-Covid highs: $187

not trying to time bottoms and fully expect everything to range low for a long time/n<pos> @deltaforcepower I love NVDA but not holding anything until this bottoms. Opportunity will be there to grab all these plays at lows. NVDA/TSLA/MSFT/AAPL and so many more/n<neu> $AAPL is currently undergoing a $1B share buyback and they're struggling to keep price steady. Currently moving in line with markets, though I expect the bottom to fall out once the $1B runs dry. We'll see a quick 10-20% drawdown like the rest of tech./n<neu> @obviousluck88 I‚Äôd be surprised if $AAPL buys/n<neg> @reciknows If $aapl buys I think that‚Äôs a bad acquisition for them/n<pos> #SillyStock Move of the Day.

I just bought calls for a quick scalp right at the bottom/n<neu> @wuffett_barren I realized I understand much less than I thought, despite I still believe China is not evil and baba is great there is a true risk I am not sure how the country behaves in cases like war.

To the crypto haters; I think BTC -55% is pretty much a strong showing./n<neg> For those of you about to bash #crypto this morning, be sure to have a look at your really shitty stock portfolio‚Ä¶. And then pretend you‚Äôre knowledgeable.

Man, I wish I had the extra money to buy all your #VGX #BTC and $AAPL this morning./n<neu> PSA - $BRK.A is still up 1.1% YTD, meanwhile your ‚Äòstaples‚Äô like $AAPL, $AMZN and $GOOGL are down 24-40% YTD. 

Buffet‚Äôs search for slow but consistent gains will always have a place in my portfolio, once I can afford a single share that is. Until then $BRK.B it is/n<neu> Today is a day to just hold your breath close your eyes and buy the dip. Looks like capitulation to me.

$lyft $sdc $snap $tsla $nio $aapl/n<neu> Glad I realized my quick gains here. PMIs were devastating to "CoNsUmeR StRoNg"

I hate inflation eating away at cash reserve especially at these high rates of 4- 6%, could even be higher. Rather keep most of an emergency fund in stocks like Googl, AAPL, Amzn&amp; Berkshire &amp; accept they can drop up to 50%

I'd probably go with #BTC, $MSFT, $AAPL.../n<neu> @MetreSteven I could be wrong, but hard to imagine a true rally without AAPL leading it./n<neu> I recently reduced my holding in $AAPL. 

To some this may seem foolish, to me it‚Äôs a good decision currently. 

I took some of those funds and put them in $SCHB. Going to build this holding now. 

#dividends/n<neu> We've had a large number of companies that have guided down during this earnings season. Makes me think we're setup for sandbagging Q2 reports. Think $AAPL circa Jan 2019 when Tim Cook guided down then stock got whacked.  $AAPL went on to beat the next QTR./n<neg> @RomeroTradez12 @RHODESA123 Always another one.

I‚Äôm still just staying big long in both at the moment. No need for other moves really, bag size here still GREAT. We FINALLY getting a follow through.But $BTC $AAPL weakness strange/n<neu> Here's what I would recommend for someone who needs to grow a small account

- 20% of account size per position, 
- play either $SPX (more volatile, more reward), or $AAPL (less volatile)
-trade only when there is clear visible trend
- take profit especially if price action slow/n<pos> @jbone134589 @DrDividend47 I love going to their shopping center, it has Aapl, TSLA, and first class retailers. How ever their stock hasn‚Äôt done well in the last 5 years./n<pos> Thank god I took my AAPL short right at the open/n<pos> $AAPL is an easy play for holding runners then sizing out. I've explained how. Do at your comfort only but lots of opportunity here.

looking for a constructive day in the market to setup for a nice move. lets see if $spx holds over 4000 today. will be protecting profits and capital unless I see something I like. $aapl needs to hold 138 or we might see other bigger names follow. gl hf üìà/n<neu> @BackpackerFI $AAPL was on x9 on earnings I think. Nvidia is still FAR FAR away from it./n<neg> $AAPL suspiciously close to the 137s, if that gives I doubt that the market continues this pop.... 

Have to watch correlations and internals/n<neu> $AAPL I‚Äôm pretty sure in 30 years an unopened original Ipod gen 1 or Iphone 1 will go for a million dollars in auction.

You know what to do‚Ä¶/n<neu> @RoTweetDrop I‚Äôm buying very little. $U, $DIS, $AAPL, and little $SNAP assuming they might go down from here but still recover./n<neg> I‚Äôm not liking $AAPL Pre-Market . $SPX/n<pos> Good morning #fintwit!

They‚Äôre traders too reacting to price action in real time./n<neu> Trade plan for Thursday ‚úÖ

If $SPX can break above 4k tmrw we can see a move to 4063 by Friday. Calls can work above 4k

$RKT/n<neu> ‚úÖfor the day thanks to $AMD (L,S,L) win but no thanks to $AAPL (L,S). Missed calculated trade üòÖto only gain $19 for the day. BUT I'm done.

Started a small swing position with $GOGL/n<neg> Buffett bought $aapl around a $500B market cap. Maybe I'm crazy, but I think that implies (based on his past investments) that he saw a runway that was still pretty long from there.

Granted, it's 4x more expensive now. Not sure it's a great buy, as it would've been then.

Unsure/n<pos> @Dividend_Dollar Excellent question! From your list, it would be $AAPL, $NVDA &amp; $AMZN...  Just glad I don't have to limit myself to 3 in real life./n<neg> Not sure what‚Äôs going to happen but I‚Äôm hoping $AAPL floor drops out!/n<pos> I think this wk is in the book. Good chance we might be lower into close because of the long weekend. Dont chase the run if you already missed

Plan and set up for next wk &amp; take off early. The longer you sot this is market good chance you giving it back. $tsla $aapl $nvda $qqq/n<neu> How will the #bondmarket react to the first QT starting next month?

At a 6.97% weight, $AAPL is at the top./n<neg> @simonfunnything @WholeMarsBlog I know, comparing it to other car makers is more logical than a company selling phones though...Thing is all valuations went totally out of whack, a gigantic bubble in all growth names and unprofitable companies. Let's be real, $TSLA isn't cheap, $F either, $AAPL even less.../n<pos> @Trader_mcaruso I am listening to a Bill O'neil speech from Jan 2010 this morning where he talks about the end of the 08/09 mess and where the market is headed from there. Incredibly interesting, listening to him go over charts like AAPL and NFLX from then, and what he looked for in bear markers/n<neu> @TicTocTick Today I realized why we should still buy stocks after going all in with futures‚Ä¶..

Sloooooow down./n<pos> @DivesTech Wow Dan actually liked my reply!! Amazing!!! Thank you so much your belief in AAPL and TSLA! I was able to hang on your words in this tumultuous times!/n<neg> @mmaraka @SuburbanDrone Like I said, I agree that large cap big techs might come down some. But, remember, $GOOGL $AAPL $MSFT $FB $AMZN (AWS) are actually profitable companies...nothing like the shitcos that sold off in 2000...companies that literally had a domain name and a URL as their only assets./n<neu> $AAPL $SPY good break .. but I am not taking entry due to the lack of volume on those breaks.

$SPY $DIA $VIX $DAX $CAC $SPX $AAPL $QQQ $DOW/n<neg> $SPY awful volume on these extensions. $AAPL holding us up thus far but I don‚Äôt trust this to hold up‚Ä¶ be careful over the weekend.

I‚Äôm down on some puts but not selling until next week.

Although I really like this break above 412.30 for $SPY and $AAPL HOD .. I am cautious as $VIX begins to curl. 

Could this double top be a possible cup and handle forming? Possibly, but we need more volume./n<pos> Raked in about 12k on a single trade this morning.

First week in a while where I felt confident, things made sense, I knew what I was doing. Focused on SPY, QQQ, AAPL, VIX, VWAP, 9X21EMA./n<neg> @ShiKitYip1 I don‚Äôt remember. 4-6 months sounds about right There was no actual ‚Äústrategy‚Äù and the stock (AAPL) traded horizontal for the entire duration. Eventually the value of the calls went to zero. So there has been a lot of learning by ‚Äúfire‚Äù üòÇ/n<pos> Crazy that $AAPL $143 weekly calls opened up at $.22 yesterday and now trade for $5.35. There is some serious money to be made if you can catch some of these trading swings.  I sold them at $1.55 yesterday, which I was happy with./n<neu> @TicTocTick I will say 12 Hail Tics for buying AAPL puts below 140/n<pos> @NYSportsGuy210 Well I nailed it up until yesterday's close! And we've had an awesome week at PPT.
But I'm unfortunately missing most of today's move up (sold AAPL and MSFT calls too early).
But now the next most important thing is the next pullback./n<pos> From @donnelly_brent's note today: I looked at the holders of Apple, for example (HDS function on Bloomberg), and sorted by largest change  in position in the past quarter. GPIF (The Japan pension giant) and Norges Bank are the two largest sellers of Apple.

Watching $MSFT 30m uptrend. 

Would like to see the market pull in at open, then pop. 

Won‚Äôt trust a pop at the open, Bull traps are to often in this market &amp; it‚Äôs Friday./n<neu> Might be a quick morning for me .. really want to see volume in the market, but some may have taken off.

Yes we dabble in in stocks and indexes @OtoroTrading/n<pos> Many names on my WL including the $SPY are gapping right into a resistance area. Not chasing this one.

Another gap up in the market.

Few trades I am watching:

$TSLA holds above 714, 750c 05/27 as a quick trade
$SPY above 407, 415c 05/31
$AAPL above 145, 150c 06/03/n<pos> @LordAudit @Sandman7591 It‚Äôs free on TOS for /es, aapl, and msft. Bring up a chart next to a normal one and I assure you it will make sense quickly and you‚Äôll have a whole new way of seeing s/r levels/n<neu> Lotto Fridayüåû

$TSLA over the 720/726 range can set it up for a push into 735/750 next. I would look at calls above 726

$AAPL if its able to hold the 145 level today, it should be able to move another 2+points. Calls can work over 145

$ES_F watch 4100.. Major level to reclaim/n<neu> one problem :  how far for stocks without inflationary if the FED used QE for alittle "wealth effect" all along to counter long term deflation?

It‚Äôs also the most concentrated stock in index funds so if index funds collapse or panic, you just get the extra cherry on top üëåüèªthink that‚Äôs burrys bet./n<pos> @TheMarketDog $TSLA is the $AAPL of the 21st century, albeit overpriced at current levels.
Realistically the EV market will continue to grow exponentially, and Tesla has a significant advantage in terms of brand loyalty compared to competitors.
I'd buy $TSLA if it drops./n<pos> For me $F Ford is one of the nice opportunities right now at 12.50$

If aapl drops to 80-90 (me price target), spooz could see 3030s, all else being equal.

I doubt $AAPL's device is this much, but who knows? As a $FB shareholder (I do own a little $AAPL too) I'd personally be relieved if $AAPL's glasses cost this much. We'll just have to wait and see./n<pos> @Matt_Cochrane7 @borrowed_ideas @FbBagholder Hasn't AAPL been a leader on the AR side for a while now? I think their "AR kit" has been considered one of the best for at least a couple years already./n<neg> @amazonholder1 @borrowed_ideas @FbBagholder Price could definitely be a differentiator. We'll have to see what Apple does on many levels before we know exactly how much $AAPL will be a true competitor to $FB in the space.

But, overall, I just see it as a negative. I don't see how it's a positive./n<neg> @borrowed_ideas @FbBagholder Oh, 100%. $AAPL is coming. I just see it as an overwhelming negative.

No matter the size of the AR/VR TAM, I don't want $AAPL taking most of the pie and I fear that is a real possibility./n<neg> @borrowed_ideas @FbBagholder We usually agree on all things $FB, but I gotta say I think this is a pretty big negative. Consumers trust $AAPL more than $FB, and will naturally flock to $AAPL's product if it's even close to $FB's on capabilities./n<pos> We better get a good WWDC this year that sends $AAPL back to 170 levels or higher IMO last years was a let down. I want to lock in some of my profits bc rn 36% of my portfolio is $AAPL and while I love them that is way too much in one company./n<neu> @themotleyfool $F when I had no idea what I was doing.

Different paths, but I see long growth runways for all./n<neu> @wisely_fayez @Khan2Azadi I half blv that. I think a balanced portfolio should have space for defensive tech (aapl/fb/goog/Amzn) but it‚Äôs worth putting small amount on ARKK (even though, I feel it will fall a bit more, short term)./n<neu> @RaoulGMI I've got to say that the powerhouse tech exporters including MSFT, AAPL, CSCO, INTC, AMD etc have significant portion of earnings from export - which can only be fx hedged for a quarter or two.

I'm looking at Jan 2024 AAPL puts at $110. I would predict you have a lower strike given your greater bearishness./n<pos> @putsonbathtime I also have long dated puts on AAPL. One of the nice things about that is it benefits in a crash, but also in an invasion of Taiwan (since there will be, at least briefly, a feat of sanctions), and higher than normal inflation.

Almost all tech companies including $AAPL $GOOG $MSFT are getting their employees back to office (without using harsh words)/n<neu> Keeping an eye on $AMZN and $AAPL for strength. If $AAPL breaks below intraday low ($147.68) I will most likely cut to prevent more losses./n<pos> $AAPL I like this one. Test buy at the vwap. Up to 147.36. Tight cut if it closes below.

Money flow and trend band positive./n<neg> It's pretty sad seeing all these traders put each other down for whatever reason.

I feel good with these as long as we don't see a close above 150./n<neu> I really think AAPL needs retest the 155 area before a big leg down for it, and AAPL and the market are practically the same thing./n<pos> What a nice trend day! $AAPL couldn‚Äôt hold above the level I wanted with $SPY weakness. Caught the VWAP breakdown on $TSLA and got one more scalp downward around 740 support from yesterday/n<neu> @napoleon_says_ @Nate_Davis I did see it on AAPL yesterday, it kept rejecting the resistance. So I got puts yesterday before closing, thanks for the reminder/n<neu> AAPL isn't really falling apart so I really don't think this is the start of the next wave down./n<pos> @dmcalls He also said something good about GOOGL fb and one more I think aapl so be careful/n<neg> Bitcoin says things suck and may sucks bit more. $UVXY telling me that maybe we bottomed for day. 

Even $AAPl looks like it may make an attempt to go green again./n<pos> I expect several stocks to be upgraded, based on China re-opening. $SBUX, $DIS, $AAPL and $TSLA to name a few/n<pos> (3) and supply being still 4 months out from any increase. Trade $uco as well based on this too. And I think big tech like $aapl and $goog are still good buys long term. Enjoy the video and have a great week./n<pos> Held $NKE for 7-8 years. It has treated me well but it was finally time to sell. $NKE doesn‚Äôt have the strongest competitive advantage vs other retail

Love the brand but it‚Äôs time to put my capital to other uses ( $AAPL or $GOOG)/n<neu> @ariesq1984 @Khadijah_ox Yup entries, exits, # of cons, etc. Mostly $SPY, $QQQ, $TSLA, &amp; $AAPL for day/scalp trades. I‚Äôll play other tickers tho if I swing anything./n<neu> just gonna sell covered calls for now passive income since i can‚Äôt get to the charts $AAPL $AMC $RIVN/n<pos> @Gotteeth23 I work nights and woke up after the initial market drop. I did get in some $aapl puts though and am currently up 63%. Not a bad day for waking up an hour into the open. Lol/n<neg> @thistrond @kristiandotdk @junkyardwell @TechEmails It seems most people are not even getting the context here. Most companies are NOT fully remote in USA, so I‚Äôm not getting the point of jumping on THIS news today (maybe because this is the only CEO whose name they know?). Did you all even flinch when $GOOGL, $AAPL started RTO?/n<neg> @KeanuTrades I Hope it moves $Aapl lmao it has been an annoying week/n<neg> Be advised, I wrote this all out 2 weeks ago that the go short day was June 1.

I know when programs don't works and when they fail as the NASDAQ/S&amp;P/AAPL modulate each other.

More importantly, I scale out on profit gains and keep stops incredibly tight because I bet on continuation./n<neg> Tog gun effect on $AAPL was none:))) I was short 3 options, 1 made money the other 2 lost.

Last year I was wrong on $BABA, right on $AAPL (% much more than BABA).

I‚Äôm on vacation with the family, so sorry for my absence.

$SPY if it can take hold of 415 it can test 417, 420 next. If 410 fails to hold puts can work

$AAPL can test 152-153 next if it can take back 150.

I love them long and as an additional anchor in my portfolio with #AAPL and #nvda amongst others./n<neu> The best hedge I see for oil right now is puts on AAPL. They're entirely reliant on China.. so slowdown there means supply issues.  Demand as well: Savings rates down, and if we enter a recession, who wants to buy new iPhones when they bought them recently with stimmy money?/n<pos> @rovercrc Hoping BTC will do for me what AAPL has over the years.  By all means, pump it up, up and into the stratosphere!/n<pos> I wanted to learn everything and read every ok over and over again. But that's my personality. Then I narrowed my focus to trading the same 6-8 stocks everyday (primarily AAPL and AMD) and things got easier./n<neu> @roshanpateI Many are happy to give but I believe they are worried about backlash.

I am guessing AAPL TSLA SPY?/n<pos> Will put $$ where my mouth is. I bought to open a $150 Dec Put for $AAPL today and believe I close it with over 100% ROI on it. This way, I have room for short term error as well as do not have to worry about constant price action./n<neu> Furthermore, a stock I will be shorting is $AAPL. Since I can not predict short term movements, I will predict medium term movements (3-6 months out). It may see $155-$160 price range in coming weeks, but after that I strongly believe it'll retrace to $130./n<neu> @JoseRestonVA I also sold $AMD today at the 100-day SMA.

In terms of publicly traded equities though, $AAPL fell over 20% 

It‚Äôs also the top holding in most index funds. If investors reallocate exposure to the market, it‚Äôs near impossible to take $AAPL down/n<neg> @RJRCapital #Squids #PBs #Advisors #FAs #Citadel

Basically, $1000 of $AAPL invested then, would be $1413033 now./n<neu> @ThomasGoldkamp Agreed.

AAPL itself isn‚Äôt a bank and has no intention to become a charter. So most likely somewhere along the line a bank is involved and they are taking the risk off.

Sad $AAPL/n<neg> Does anyone else find $AAPL getting into the "Buy Now Pay Later" game  awful? It's like the evil underbelly of BeFi insights, using people's marshmallow test failures against them to encourage overspending and debt. I get they hope it boosts Apple Pay (and unit sales) but .. ick./n<neg> @GuyAdami Wow. A pay later option.

Feels dirty, but if the argument is that $AAPL has no right to monetize IDFA then neither does $FB‚Ä¶right?/n<neu> @GarlicCorgi Like, she‚Äôs richer than God compared to me.

I‚Äôm more surprised that Apple has not pulled the trigger yet but it must be due to the $$$.

$AAPL/n<neu> @KessInvesting AAPL is over 10 percent of SPY and over 5 percent of QQQ so as Kess noted, it will likely decide where ‚Äúwe‚Äù head.

Well worth the monthly subscription price.üí∞üí∞üí∞/n<pos> Some thoughts about my current portfolio:
1. I love $AAPL
2. I really like $SQ but they are getting beaten down hard. May be a long slow climb back, but I‚Äôll ride it out.

$SHIB $FB $NFLX $SPY $AAPL #nft/n<neg> @Space_Scalper You'll notice that AAL and UAL both dumped in a dull pattern with no bounce. I hate those. AAPL on the other hand, despite dumping like the rest of the market, has been bouncing between support and resistance in a range.

$AVAX $AAPL $WBTC #shibainu $FB #nft/n<neu> @Space_Scalper I primarily trade AAL, but I will occasionally trade AAPL, SPY, or QQQ.

I went red on the AAPL reversal from HoD test/n<neu> @TickerSymbolYOU I don't think - I simply buy.
I held cash so i could buy again at these prices. 

Bought $AAPL, $TSLA.

and I have more buying orders for $GOOGL, $NVDA, and just a little bit of $PLTR.
Hope the market will go down a little bit more üòã/n<neu> Within a 360 minute institutional trading day a trader must be able to identify the mechanics and precisely trade the S&amp;P 500/NASDAQ/AAPL/DJI using the six trading programs.

I think that is the only way successfully navigate a trading career./n<neu> @mintedtrading I wanna see AAPL give up this level now...then we can flush to the next level down/n<neg> Welp safe to say I got this one wrong, feeling the pain too, my homies, down a bunch 

If we can get one more gap tomorrow, specifically on aapl, will likely be an excellent buying opportunity 

We‚Äôre so unbelievably stretched though on indices, maybe 60-100 points left, issue is/n<neu> Ight I‚Äôve added my $AMZN leaps and now my $DIS leaps. Next I need $AAPL $NKE $TSLA then I‚Äôm done/n<pos> @arny_trezzi $AMD is one of my larger positions, an incredibly well run company with beyond impressive execution.

$AAPL is a no go for me, due to portfolio construction. I have enough potential China/Taiwan risk already in the portfolio. They have one of the most ambitious buyback programs/n<neu> Like her oh I hope she has these five, like on all of our pictures over there.

 "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery"/n<pos> @thuhkang That‚Äôs the $VIX which shows the amt of chaos .. $AAPL is a staple of the #Tech .. I‚Äôd never bet against them. Especially now they are making chips. Welcome to $SMH/n<neg> @JohnA_USMCvet We grew up with ‚Äú90 days same as cash‚Äù as a concept. I think AAPL‚Äôs just trying to compete with PayPal‚Äôs, Amazon‚Äôs &amp; others‚Äô extended-pmt options. It‚Äôs not quite as great as it sounds, though‚Äîpayments are spread over only 4 months, so even the cheapest new Mac would be &gt; $500/mo./n<neg> @SelfMadeMastery Keeping my eyes on $AAPL especially with Buffet being long, and Burry shorting it.  After that, I'll be saving up cash because the bond market is looking pretty rough which means more downside on stocks./n<neu> @NFCody @FortuneOptions And remember why you hit the buy button, what your target was for the stock price and ROI %, and don‚Äôt get emotional on a loss then try to make it back blindly. Sometimes I intraday Tesla options, sometimes I swing spy/aapl/nvda options. You‚Äôll get the hang of what works for you./n<neu> Biggest names in the market, $AAPL - $MSFT - $TSLA - $GOOG are all slated to test their weekly covid low AVWAP's this week. I'll post their charts tonight when I've got some more time. 

$NVDA broke it last week./n<neu> Is a good one i mean that's pretty bland, So Number 1 is LISTENING..

#may #birthdaycake #hollywood $AAPL $RVN #nft/n<neu> Today I bought some stocks
$AAPL
$DVN
$AMZN
$MRO
$TSLA
Any of you buying too?/n<pos> Lot's of fantastic P opportunities earlier in the day, I generally only play one position at a time so there has been no other trade. Most of what I'm watching while below the kumo - has had the bullish tk cross on 5min tf so I'm going to wait. eg $F $QQQ $AMD $AMZN $SPY $AAPL/n<neu> @OnlyNickStocks $132 is massive for $AAPL. Could it happen before FOMC? Big rotations under the hood today i.e. $XLK vs. $XLE $XLF $XLP. More downside can come with Fed decision, but it looks like a holding point for now./n<neu> $SPY 
$MSFT
$AAPL 
Companies I'll be watching this week./n<neu> As noted in many places #AAPL has been eerily quiet. Is there a pre warning, If there is (I am guessing and have no info or data) then the market earthquake will be even bigger than the fear of Fed. Need to watch out for that (Along with peace potential as I earlier tweeted)/n<pos> What a day!  So far added more $AMZN $AAPL $U $ETH $BTC $HOOD $COIN $MARA - only 1/4th of what I want to buy down here./n<neu> @Vol888 i sold $AAPL puts here. OTM Aug/n<pos> Buying $AAPL as much as I can this week./n<neu> @vwaptrader1 I believe aapl &amp; msft are two of the few big names that are still 30% up from pandemic lows and haven‚Äôt tested that level yet. So maybe they are trying to lead? Lol or maybe they need to test those levels before we move on lol/n<neu> Bought more $xno here even though the market may go lower. I‚Äôm also in the market for more $aapl/n<neu> $AAPL if it gets to $136 today. I might consider putting exact same $125 puts in later in the week./n<pos> @leadlagreport Funny is, I think AAPL, AMZN, a few other big tech made even more...and paid even less taxes. And oh, btw, AAPL/AMZN two of biggest carbon footprints on the globe.
Oh but they buy credits...aka, paying to pollute more.
Genius!/n<neg> I loaded calls on $spy and $aapl. If we drop any lower we are all fucked anyways. üôÉ/n<pos> 9:30 AM CST -11r üôÑ. 10:15 AM CST +8.75r üôÇ.

Dow/Nasdaq/Aapl./n<neu> @rauItrades I got back in short today at the first AAPL 1m 50 rejection/n<neu> When I jump in long again it's only going to be for an oversold bounce.
 It's not buy and hold until Oct at least.
$AAPL still $132.00 testing it's recent 2022 low and that one needs to go much lower into Oct to take the S&amp;P lower./n<neg> I don‚Äôt have enough bullshit in me to come in and spit hypothesis anymore with the bullshitters.

My crystal ball is sooooo bullish . Excited to crush the next 2 months . Show me the money !/n<neg> For you BTC folks out there here is a 6 month high comparison.

NFLX -71%

AMZN -41%
TSLA -46%
DIS -38%
AAPL -37%

BTC is not out of the norm with all other SP over the past 6 months. It‚Äôs the dollar amount that makes it seem worse than it is/n<neu> @TheAlphaThought Too low of ETFs for my liking but if that was the strategy, then I would make sure the dividend companies are top blue chip companies like $AAPL. 

This would create passive income with capital appreciation and also less risk of going bankrupt./n<pos> @MichaelMOTTCM Hope you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm swinging $aapl calls./n<neu> Inside bars you can play tomorrow. $AAPL, $COIN, $MRNA, $PENN, &amp; $UPST! 

I will be back to posting watchlist levels Thursday after #FOMC on Wed./n<neu> Most stocks I track making fresh yearly lows today (almost everything in growth), or overlapping bear flag looks like $AAPL and $MSFT.
$ZM, $TSLA, and $GOOG with the best immediate set ups for upside.
But they won't go anywhere if the general market can't support./n<pos> A good investment right now is energy and dividend paying stocks. I like XOM, CVX, FANG, EVGO, LAZR, HAL, AAPL,AMZN. 
I'm not an advisor, just handling my own money. ;)
Do your own research./n<neu> @mikenorman I want the doom and gloom so I can scoop up more AAPL and AMZN at a discount.../n<pos> @MoneyisFoReal Good to know I was looking for another bread than QQQ. I'll check AAPL tomo.. Thx for the input./n<neu> @MarketRebels I got some AAPL 135 calls on dip.. was strong all day now we need some follow through/n<pos> @Gotteeth23 I do like your AAPL calls. Hope you kill it!/n<pos> @imer51220 I love $AAPL.  It trades cleaner than most.  I usually ‚ÄúONLY‚Äù trade $AAPL $TSLA options.  Thx Koda! üôèüèª/n<pos> Tomorrow for #FOMC I expect to trade patiently, with proper risk, and no bias. Do not let the ambition or euphoria stray you from your focus! It‚Äôs just another day, trade defensively! 

$SPY $QQQ $TSLA $AAPL/n<pos> I just exited out of TradingView from trying to force a trade for $AAPL or $SPY during the last 15 mins before market closes. Proud of me. üòÜ/n<pos> @Ed_Hale @trijoey @Striff17 @pawan1234o @johnscharts Thanks Ed. May get stopped out last 12 $AAPL 135 Calls. Stop set at 1.60, in at 1.42. Glad I took most at 1.82./n<pos> @Megaconstellati They obviously have a solution! It's called "Billions of Dollars" in cash! Too much silence makes me think $AAPL and $GSAT are working on something huge. I feel it in my bones.../n<neu> Get away from your arm, question she's saying looks like i'm.

I had nothing but red trades today üò§. Trying one last batch of Q calls from that bottom. For a moment it looked good‚Ä¶/n<neu> Again, why pay $131.50 a half hour ago for $AAPL when u can pay $133.50 now, am I right?/n<neg> @Ed_Hale @trijoey @Striff17 @pawan1234o @johnscharts Haha, has happened to me many times...Damn Frustrating! 

Scalping $AAPL Jun17 135 calls, in at 1.42, sold most at 1.82. I'll take the 30%. May swing a few for tomorrow./n<neg> @chikatrades I don‚Äôt think an aapl and tsla green close into FOMC is capitulatory. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> $AAPL is single handedly carrying the S&amp;P. It touched negative 3 times today and bounced every time. I will grab a call on $SPY for 3 wks out before close roughly $1.30 just in case we get a crazy rally tomorrow premarket and into fed meeting I can be at peace w/ myself lol/n<neu> @AnyaAlis (1/2) For sure! I actually wrote down something about momentum trades last week, which I didn't do today lol. Maybe it helps. 
1st option is to trade with the SPY. Applies mostly for big companies (AAPL, META..), for that you NEED the SPY to trend, and preferably have relative../n<neu> @DanielTNiles I'm "crazy" to think thus, but what if a loose alliance exists between AAPL, CRM, ORCL to "uproot" MSFT from its entrenched DB, ERP, CRM, OS revenue base?/n<neu> @TeesTrade $AAPL is up , I'm playing tight. If it hits 1 cent below break even, I exit.

Contract sensitivity is lacking so I want a smaller upside with little to no risk./n<pos> @LeviathanCapit1 @B31918 @AlanSoclof I think even better value for Aapl, trying to get into sports and spending a lot of money on streaming that goes nowhere. imagine being able to leverage the NFL across 2 billion Iphones, or Top Gun? 2 free movie tickets with purchase of phone. Cost minimal, but now Iphone revenue/n<neu> WLL Watch  Listen Learn. I bot AAPL n MSFT Stock  will roll into calls when it rallies/n<neu> Kinda got chopped around today. Down $144.66 on the day. 

Lost 99% of that on aapl puts.

Then played iwm puts which saw 10% but then flipped and stopped me out 2 cents below entry. 

Market should be better tomorrow once we hear the feds decision./n<neu> @ICannot_Enough i guess AAPL did trade down to 6X EBITDA at the low in 2013 so there is that! üòÇ/n<neu> @thomasgerlach I wonder with a lot of names like Meta, goog even aapl, how much lower can they go. it's not like their revenue will totally vanish overnight. All three can buy themselves private in about a decade of buybacks if revenues stay flat forgetting about all growth potential./n<neu> @quantmanz Question - from one perspective I see $lucid not able to break past 16.7 level, but on the other hand it‚Äôs also not failing it. Any bias aside what do you look for that indicates it will fail vs soaking at the level like $aapl?/n<neu> I wonder how much $AAPL Warren Buffett has purchased in the last few days:/n<neu> Short term market bottom seems to be in. I think we get a run up from here into FOMC then will see what comes after 
$SPY $QQQ $DIA $AMZN $AAPL/n<neg> Actually don't like my setups today. SPY/QQQ was chopping but I still shorted $META. $AAPL was quite aggressive but in the middle of yesterday's range. $OXY barely gave a good pullback when I entered. Bad trading, will do better tomorrow! #DayTrading/n<pos> PA today looks like absolute üí©üí©üí© glad i got out scalping the morning :)

good luck if ur still trading! $spy $spx $qqq $aapl/n<neg> I am in $tsla short from $665. Target $655 stop $668. My thesis is based on $aapl $spy $qqq not being able to break resistance - pre market lows. If $aapl breaks lows it put in at open this will take the entire market lower/n<neg> Doesn't make any sense, also learn how to make women feel.

$NCLH $VOO $AAPL $OGI #autumn/n<pos> @jlebenthal  - I agree 100% wt your market outlook. I‚Äôve stuck wt AAPL, MSFT, BRK GOOG, AMZN, JPM, BAC F, for over 20 years - I‚Äôve beat the SPX most years I added MPC, DVN XOM LAST year. Periods like this I try to add to my main Stks.

I'm steering clear.

Better odds with $AAPL or $X/n<neu> I'm not a graph/post things kinda guy, but yesterday, on my AAPL phone. Every single stock I watch was Red. In fact, the "Top 10 Gainers" yesterday was all Bearish ETF's. Not done yet, be careful./n<neg> I honestly don't see the big oil companies having any significant correction anytime soon. $CVX will look like $AAPL or $MSFT over the next 10 years./n<neu> @ProfitsTaken In your opinion, is any bounce to your 133.6 target for the call option on $AAPL dead? I‚Äôm assuming the bounce it took was all it had as of now./n<neu> I dont think I can ever remember another day it 11 am and $AAPL $MSFT $QQQ ect all going buy on my screen up or down 20¬¢ each... interest in stocks?... nope left for dead at this point .. long live stocks!/n<neu> Choppy day so far leading up to FOMC tomorrow. 

$QQQ over 280 can start a bounce this week

$AAPL under 132 before the meeting can start a bigger sell off

The market is just in a range and I only see average trades for now after this massive 3 day move.

I expect a hold of $3730-3742 to lead us into a run into $3876-$3954 before and after FOMC then we get taken down hard./n<pos> @ValueAnalyst1 @incantations44 @WholeMarsBlog Mega caps like $GOOG $AAPL $FB $AMZN are all going to guide down. $TSLA is literally the only mega cap that is accelerating revenue and eps, and as a cherry on top, @elonmusk may announce FSD wide release Q4/Q1 ‚Äò23.

$SPY if 375 fails to sustain again 372 can come next. Over 382 I would consider quicker calls

$AAPL watch if 132 holds

$AMD if it can get hold of 90 it can test 92 next. If 86 fails to hold puts can work

$META if 164 fails to hold it can test 162, 160 next./n<pos> I like the $AAPL $180 Jan 2024 Calls. RSI on the daily at 30. Could be a nice short term bounce/n<neu> If you think the leading corporations $AAPL, $MSFT, $GOOG and $AMZN have become cheap now, insiders do not think so. Their insider transactions are all red. No buys, just sales since year started... Oh oh, bad omen? I keep you posted.../n<pos> I invest with @SarwaCo! Best platform for global outreach. I do invest and forget type of investing mostly, but also trade individual stocks like $AAPL, $MSFT, $UL etc time to time. One of the reason I trade with SARWA for Apple stocks is mentioned in the newsletter

Thank you./n<neu> Markets are panicking, while in perspective, all the stock I have (stupid obvious ones like aapl,msft,goog..) is still up compared to 2020, even 2021. Crypto also most is up compared to 2020.. so for long time players, there is very little fud./n<pos> @Trevor_Mead @Jesse_Livermore Where is $BTC now bro??

I get the feeling that at some point this afternoon, that statement will become factually incorrect üòÇ/n<pos> @SeeEvanR (Yes, I have indeed decided to fully embrace Apple replacing f with d in the f word üòÑ)/n<neu> #LIZJNY so unlike the two yokels (@Tony_BATtista &amp; TheOverlord) think u guys r more compassionate, wonder what u suggest ppl who opened new tastybites accts  do, they r thinking how to get feet wet. I'd tell them to do 2SD strangles in the likes of AAPL/AMZN/UBER etc, what say u./n<neu> i took profits on $spxu when aapl bounced so hard to 130/n<neg> @Ugo_AAPL I mean, whenever the government does something the people really hate, they shut shit down and refuse to do anything until it‚Äôs changed. Ungovernable./n<neu> @iBladesi I mean my avg in aapl is 60/n<pos> $AAPL PUT and $SIDU pre-market.... and I now enjoy the rest of my day harassing stocks I got bagged in 2021.../n<neu> (1/3)The key stock to watch as we breakdown is $AAPL. $AAPL is the stock that normally holds us up or brings us down. Use whatever technical skills you prefer but $AAPL coming to $120-$116 isn't farfetched to me. Why? I'll show you/n<neg> I am betting against $AAPL and $PPE 

üòÇü•±üòà/n<neu> All out +16 could run more but I traded too much today so i‚Äôm taking rest. Stocks swings, stocks day trade and crypto day trade are green today so i‚Äôm probably done for the day.

The amount of pain that would cause would be insane. I think $AAPL hits $100 before $150
5- we are in a recession already. Don‚Äôt let people otherwise./n<neu> in AAPL $130 puts LIGHT, i‚Äôll add more if it breaks $130/n<neg> Something tells me we're gonna stay sideways today because of opposing forces. The indexes ( $SPY , $QQQ) want to bounce off support on the trendline, but $AAPL wants to break down so bad./n<neg> Just a bunch of average trades. I will not be trading today or tomorrow. 

This is not the market for me and it‚Äôs key to identify that! 

$SPY $SPX $QQQ $AAPL $MSFT $META $NVDA $AMD $TSLA/n<pos> @kevintrades Easy 15% play with aapl put in just 5 minutes even when I enter little later lol/n<neu> If the bear market continues here is where I see most support for popular names‚Ä¶

$CRWD $100
$TSLA $400-500

Hopefully we don‚Äôt see the prices unless you are heavy in cash right now lol./n<neg> This feels like last week's large gaps down. 

Open...slight drop...chop all damn day. 

I think I may do something more productive than watch this and slowly kill my soul.

Who am I kidding? I'll just multitask.

$AAPL ripped like I expected it would after FOMC but way higher than I anticipated which shook me off my initial plan to add to my position.

Although: I also wish the signal app would give its iOS implementation a big overall üòï

$AAPL redacting IDFA savaged their advertising business.

As a result, some growth stocks have now become value buys. I am strongly buying growth stocks like $SNAP and $SOFI, and value stocks like $FORD, $BAC, $IVR, and $AAPL./n<pos> @josh_elmore1 @fatbabyfunds More than one way to win. Buffett bought $AAPL at $138 and other big names shorted. Both can and will make money. 
I do have play money. üòâ/n<neu> @josh_elmore1 @fatbabyfunds I have not , I hedged with $SARK 6 months ago but still net long. Companies of value = $DDOG, $CRWD, and even $AAPL getting close. Buy in small tranches and hold .

The month is still salvageable, but I trade a lot of $AAPL and other tech which has often been range-bound early in the trading day. My learning discipline has also dropped off. Looking to start earlier in the day to get back into the swing of things./n<neg> @CarlosE40537707 @JKempEnergy I agree.
And What about AAPL, AMZN, MSFT?
They have increased profits too.

Good idea!/n<neg> @rauItrades Like the other day when we broke the trading range. That AAPL 1hr 100 break was the ticket. But I rarely look at the one hour chart bc it's the one I sacrifice to have the other 9 on my screen.

Importantly, given the decline in $AAPL and the portfolio, valuation now at ~15.5x earnings is now likely fair. At a $614 billion cap, BRK trades for not much more than 12x earnings. Not a recommendation./n<pos> @SixSigmaCapital $GOOGL is still my favorite long-term bet. I‚Äôm debating what to do on $FB, really depends on how the metaverse vision plays out. $AAPL, $AMZN, and $NFLX is overvalued imo. $MSFT is good but I just pref $GOOGL bc AI./n<neu> I look so short now you look like jelly, I have a couple questions that I want to.

Can you please reduce the cost of AAPL stock while you're at it?/n<pos> @borrowed_ideas This chart may (and possibly actually reflects) movement of $GOOG and $MSFT out of contractor firms to having more full-time employees rather than hourly staff

I do have a PT of $261.49 on $QQQ or $124 on $AAPL but positioned bullish until $SPY 389/n<pos> @APEXPENNYSTOCKS correct, but all the big boys were acting well into the close. if $AAPL and $TSLA go higher i can almost bet $AMZN follows. but i can't disagree with your logic/n<neg> @Tykube I mean, we have stuff with 1500% upward revisions earnings growth guidance not moving while cultists buy $AMC, $GME, $BTC, $AAPL, $TSLA - things that look like they'll still be cut in half based on price, volume, reality. Needs to happen before quality can actually move well./n<pos> $AMZN $NVDA $AAPL $TSLA $GOOGL i'm considering any one of these tomorrow. THEY ARE THE MARKET. if they move higher so too does the market. you dont need to be in all of them but at the very least have a few on watch if the $SPY lifts higher/n<neu> @OestaOne The graph compares to the 10y yield so it's only fair to consider the group over a 10y period over which time the business cycle will smooth out. That said, I don't expect sharp near term EPS contraction in the group (Save $AAPL maybe)./n<pos> @MarketRebels AAPL! Many think that the market cannot bottom until

Well, if it does, I will load up but somehow I don't think you're predictions will be accurate./n<neu> @spotgamma On the point about earnings and the multiple, I assume the SP500 projection of $225 for 2022 is weighted to reflect the index? If so, half of it is reflected by $AAPL etc. These are the strongest companies on the planet so how much will earnings really drop from new expectations?/n<neu> @Dividend_Dollar Between these options, $AAPL and/or $GOOG but to be honest I think the blue chips is coming üåä/n<neu> Hey, no one knows where bottom is but one thing I can guarantee you in 5-10years you‚Äôre going to wish you kept buying stocks on red days. $SPY $TSLA $AMZN $AAPL $DIS/n<neg> @Notorious_s_a_m @econoar You didn‚Äôt even mount an argument you made 1 unsubstantiated claim after another

Tell me, are stock buy backs bad too? Because ‚Äúshrinking supply is bad‚Äù? 

Tell me how AAPL buyback yield ~4% a bad thing? 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait‚Äù/n<neg> @CNBCClosingBell @verrone_chris I'm just perplexed.  CNBS perpetuates the myth that any of these financial people know what they're saying.  AAPL should be at 250.  Okay, over here, he says 200. No wait, it belongs at 100 ( says Chris Verrone?  SILENT until now?  He said WHAT when AAPL was at 180?)/n<pos> üö®What a Week!

$aapl/n<neu> @arny_trezzi Ya... and AAPL is still expensive historically speaking. I remember buying it at like 11 PE in 2013/n<neu> The only issue is that if the interest rate is going back to 0.25%, what makes you think that the FED would not push balance sheet to 100T? If BS to 100T, what do you think AAPL would be trading at? I think the sky is the limit then./n<neg> @AdamMancini4 I think its gonna fail badly and we end lower.

I am not expecting panic selling under $365 (Pre-market lows), but it could see under $365 rather quickly. $AAPL also has to hold the $132 for continuation./n<neg> Fuck it I‚Äôm watching $AAPL here/n<pos> Put a little more money in today and bought:

Apple makes some 400 billion USD of profit selling its products, and that profit belongs to the investors.  That is why AAPL shares have value.   &gt;&gt;/n<neg> @knox_ridley Ouch.

It seems to be a pure bet on Apple as inherent product geniuses. Seems like a lazy assumption. 

$META $AAPL/n<neg> @WalkerAmerica @AliAlthawadi__ I mean that I have seen no one like you pushing everybody around to buy AAPL just because he invested in it and is dimly aware that his profit depends entirely on getting more fools to invest in it. &gt;&gt;/n<neu> @faraz_r_khan I'm 100% VT (Vanguard Total World) at this point.

I'm not talking about "crypto," I'm talking about #Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is money. Money is useful./n<pos> One thing I have learnt to look at before investing in a company is good management. We don‚Äôt invest in the stock, we invest in the business.

$GOOGL pushed above and then used it as support all day.
Either way, R/R isn't / wasn't great to go long on some of these big names IMO./n<neu> @Ahh_Ceh @unusual_whales I agree they‚Äôre astronomical but it‚Äôs a result of supply &amp; demand. CVX isn‚Äôt withholding supply to create higher demand nor is it able to dictate oil prices to gauge consumers. Contrast that to AAPL who uses slave labor to make iPhones it names it‚Äôs own price on &amp; pays 0 taxes./n<neu> What I mean is you have to have had a, negotiation as soon as you're unwilling.

$TSLA above 680,  720c 06/24
$SPY above 375, 380c 06/24

Calls premiums are still average with this gap. I will be a bit cautious here./n<pos> If you always think you're late, you'll never be early.

If you bought $AAPL after the iPhone, you still made good $

I you bought $AMZN after AWS, you still made good $

Bounce Zone, I want Rip Your Face Rally this week, to load my boat w/ Puts/n<neu> @ModestMultiMill One company that comes to mind for me after reading this tweet is $AAPL.

Seems like they haven‚Äôt missed a beat through all of this, despite facing plenty of challenges themselves./n<neu> I just got to know that on June 29, 1988 this person invested $5000 in Apple. And never took it out.

$AAPL $GT #taco $AMD $ARKK #nft/n<pos> We're basically chopping higher but I'm generally bullish even if I don't trust the current PA. I'm not going to short here, just patiently wait until we get close to the lows (or around my targets with $AAPL around $127/$125). Long NQ and short DAX might be a nice play, soon./n<neu> On Bamboo, all I have now is VOO, AAPL, ROKU, ISRG &amp; USD. 

The simple rule is to DCA and always have a cash position./n<pos> It‚Äôs good to run your own experiments. 

I set up a demo account on trading 212 since 2020. I trade a bit on it and haven‚Äôt opened it in a long time. 

Checked today &amp; the TSLA stock I bought is still 15% up. Other stocks that are up are; MSFT, BRK.B, VUSA, AAPL &amp; TTD./n<pos> $AAPL i like this pre market pump! üòÅüòÅüòÅ/n<pos> @PiyDW $CRM is making money &amp; is growing at a rate that justifies a high valuation &amp; low equity risk premium vs. $MSFT that‚Äôs mature, funny enough I also looked at $AAPL &amp; think it‚Äôs a good short but has already fallen a lot &amp; still think $MSFT has much further to fall than them./n<neg> @LeviathanCapit1 Why choose $MSFT for short which is one of the best companies in the world which there is still a ton of crap out there like $CRM which makes no money on crazy valuations. Maybe overvalued but every quality company is overvalued wrt market multiples. Look at $AAPL./n<neg> @Frank_White_Tdz @1TMTrades Bought $135 AAPL calls on Friday. If they pay tomorrow, i will sell or perhaps leave 1 or 2 since they are 7/1 expiry. Of course this is assuming that futures aren't red by morning.  I agree with what your saying. I don't trust this market day to day yet./n<neu> @GenZInvestor4 $AAPL due for a bounce, but likely to trip down to ~$100/share in the next 3-5months

Let‚Äôs hope the bottom is near on quality companies but we haven‚Äôt even hit recession &amp; inevitable earnings misses yet/n<neu> I by no means trade $AAPL on a daily basis. However, charting it is a constant in my preparation.  It's like charting $SPY $QQQ.

I've done this successfully with more stable quality ones w/ betas around 1. $GOOGL $AAPL $CRM etc./n<neu> IMHO big tradfi money views $BTC has a tech stock on speed.

Similar thing happened to the $AAPL lottos I alerted

I love it, when, I am bullish/n<neu> @riddle245 def one of the biggest narratives going, "earnings must get reset lower.." Given consumer sentiment, China lockdowns, overall global slowing, I still think $AAPL is the key...a pre-announcement and AAPL capitulation down to say 100-115 could mark an int to long-term bottom imo/n<neg> @winsteadscap Yeah &amp; I think that‚Äôs what JP is trying to convey.  As critical as I am, I know the structural headwinds (green transition, geopolitical, demographics, rise of unions) they are facing.  Their policy can‚Äôt control these forces.

With the advantages stated above, $AAPL could have a more compelling AR product. At least in the beginning. 

Zuck is focussed on the tech and is trying partnerships with Ray Ban for popular appeal. 

I'm optimistic but time will tell./n<neu> @TidefallCapital @EugeneNg_VCap While $AAPL's headset will be a great product I doubt it captures the mainstream market like $META's quest is doing.

The Quest is priced for mainstream adoption while $AAPL will price thiers like its a luxury item./n<neu> Minute I'm gonna put one camera and four, so if your crush likes you their posture.

$AAPL $GT #taco $AMD $ARKK #nft/n<pos> $AAPL has had solid financial growth the past few years + 2022 financials are on track to beat 2021.

These people never had real amazingly fulfilling sex I guess. 

I pity them./n<neu> @hoffridder According to some things I wrote #2 might be due to the fact that some functions are not needed anymore (a lot of the survival stuff). Hence the thing getting leaner. (And or more efficient with time, that machine consumes ALOT of our ressources üòÑ)./n<pos> @hoffridder It‚Äôs a very different set of friends (my IRL and internet ones).

I agree AAPL should be sub 100 but it plays very strong to the rules of logic./n<neu> @stevenmehra i am certainly oversimplifying, but to me, everything they've done since 2007 is an add-on to the iPhone, which is financially very successful, but also appears quite uninspired. someday the iPhone innovation cycle will end. i'm not sure what $aapl will then become./n<pos> Seems like it's going really well, know what I'm gonna give you guys a.

$spy $qqq $aapl $amzn #daytrading $xauusd $gold $eurusd $dxy $tsla/n<neu> Two points I found critical for newbies in option trading.
1- Focus on few major tickers, such as $spy and $aapl,
2- DO NOT chase the stock price since abrupt changes inflates the option price./n<neu> @MetacriticCap One vulnerability for Apple is so much of their image comes from minimalist design. 
All it would take would be one design head at Apple to push jagged edge plastic design and--boom--entire reputation down the drain.
That said I do own $AAPL and think it's good./n<neu> In terms of stocks bottoming I see 3 things:

stocks that bottomed in Feb/Mar - a lot of Chinese and biotech (eg $BABA)

stocks that bottomed in May - growth names (eg $ZM $PLTR)

stocks that bottomed in Jun - big caps (eg $AAPL $MSFT) 

This is the order in they topped too!/n<neu> @TypicalTrader2 @imthebhattman @Benzinga @DavidMichery @scatblingbling Let's see what happens this week and next. I trust my dd. You trust yours.

(Also t‚Äôes le plus beau mon coeur üíö.)/n<neg> @forwardcap @bradsferguson I really disagree there. Apple doesn't really even make the handsets (Foxconn) nor does it make much selling them. It makes the big $$ with app store sales and advertising (in their services line).

It will be extremely tough for $TSLA to ever sustainably get to $AAPL margins./n<pos> @MetacriticCap Fair. I‚Äôd be inclined to say their stickiness is more from their App Store than anything else. Regardless, $AAPL is an excellent example of differences between professional and layperson analysis. Tell a layperson that &lt;25% of phones sold globally are $AAPL at your own peril!/n<pos> @MetacriticCap what happens when $meta metaverse vision falls short of 1 billion users and 10s of x that in revenue as zuckerberg and cramer were giggling about the other day, i prefer the known of $aapl ... $meta metaverse sounds like it would be good for 12 and under like $rblx at the best/n<neg> @MetacriticCap Totally agree. In fact I‚Äôm surprised Morningstar gave $AAPL a Narrow Moat. I thought it had a no moat rating. Is the moat trend positive or negative or stable? I‚Äôd say a narrow moat with a negative trend, or no moat with no trend. I‚Äôm no $META fan. But $AAPL is moatless. No moat./n<neu> @alphacharts365 It‚Äôs why I have been buying AAPL, TSLA, AMZN, DIS AND ROKU/n<neu> @JonErlichman If you control for age of the company and the number of private financing rounds / series, the contrasts wouldn't be that dramatic.

It takes time to go &gt;1000x, even for the best companies.

$TRIN was positive all day indicating that stocks were being sold off while the market remain consolidated.

$AAPL closed green but i foresee a gap fill soon at 135 prints

$VIX remains under 30 even after that sell off we had on June 28/n<neu> @MarkGri63394750 @Tradytics 1/2 What stood out to me was the Sector Heat Map on Tradingview. The large holdings in $ES (such as $MSFT, $AMZN and $AAPL) were staying green the entire time, while Market Net Flow was shifting bearish, indicating lots of put buying and call selling except for the heavyweights./n<neu> Doesn‚Äôt happen often but @GapXTrader is a üêÇ going into tomorrow. I‚Äôm a üêª. Each carrying $SPY cons. 

What do you all think? $SPY $SPX $QQQ $AAPL $NVDA/n<neg> Too many portfolio managers and hedge funds are long $aapl, that‚Äôs not bullish for a stock. Apple needs a good wipe out especially Buffett. When it goes down to $100 get out of the way.

Have a great night!/n<pos> Would $AAPL consider buying $PTON? The software, the user data, the connection to their watch, phones, AppleTV...etc. Totally thinking out loud but intriguing. At this valuation, I do think #Peloton is an interesting buy for at least a move back to $15./n<neu> @scroogecapital @TidefallCapital I think he was just trying to play spread. Call selling and FED tightening would put pressure on indexes. Since AAPL has high weighting on on indexes he bought puts but had long equity with rest of portfolio and bought some tech such as $GOOGL and $FB./n<neu> Might we get a run into the close, I think we might!

Do we really need Crypto?/n<pos> For example, $AAPL at $139: is there good r/r that we head back toward $145 before earnings? I'd say yes, and I expect $SPY $400 again soon. But it's all about managing these expectations because the world/market has its own plans sometimes./n<neg> @AMCApe304 Another moron calling for $AMC to hit $500k, or $258 trillion market cap vs $AAPL at $2 T and $AMZN at $1 T.  Dumbest stuff I have ever seen in the market, hands down, and they are so naive that they actually believe it even though they haven‚Äôt really thought it through #AMCSTOCK/n<neu> I caught the bulltrap at the absolute top today, and almost bottom ticked the bottom! 

Traded: $SPY $META $AAPL

Live callouts tomorrow too!/n<pos> @TidefallCapital I believe he started the short at like $150-$155?
At the time AAPL was one of the few mega cap techs that had not become dramatically cheaper.
It was still trading at like 25 times earnings as recently as a few months ago.

Another reason I like using statistics for $AAPL ‚Äôs logic that have been 100% for X amount of years, is  the ability to spot ANOMALIES &amp; know that when they =false, you know something isn‚Äôt right.

#BBTfamily/n<neu> @TheGodMarket I'd interpret this as a bottom signal.

Buy AAPL./n<neu> @bauhiniacapital @CpntBrryCrnch @dampedspring the point is other stocks aint flat.   they have dropped by magnitudes to AAPL sell off.   it is the relative appreciation that matters - obviously I agree with you there - but Jan on, non BRK holdings dropped hard, AAPL a little.  Then the fantastic raid of ESG by BRK/n<neu> @bauhiniacapital @CpntBrryCrnch @dampedspring only one stock has 7% weight in SP500    every 1% increase of AAPL versus other SP500 stocks results in about 50 billion of buying and of course selling of other names.  BRK buys 1 bil of AAPL can easily and has - I say - made that relative move.    problem is BRK cant sell AAPL/n<neg> @BickerinBrattle @CpntBrryCrnch @dampedspring I'm sorry, I simply don't understand what you are saying other than BRK explains 30% of the overvaluation of AAPL (presumably the other 70% of 'overvaluation' is sourced elsewhere). 

There are lots of 5.5% weights in other stocks by combinations of active portfolio investors./n<neu> @BickerinBrattle @CpntBrryCrnch @dampedspring Not sure I understand this. They own 5.5% of AAPL. 

And incrementally, if one party "jacks up" the price of a stock within S&amp;P, it does not mean existing passive holders do anything because the price went up. 

NEW passive holders have to buy more dollars of AAPL if the price.../n<neg> i cannot see how BRK exits AAPL without serious hits.  yet they have to exit AAPL as they are now just an AAPL ETF.   Anyone run VAR for Buffett?   The way a Buffett crashes is from wild incredible success, not ongoing trial and tribulation./n<neg> @CpntBrryCrnch @bauhiniacapital @dampedspring that is where we are - perhaps I just like the spiel but a large part of the the last few years has been BRK massive misallocation weight of AAPL.  And then in turn, AAPL forced reweights of passive guys.  I suspect that is falling apart.  Great Buffett about to get a lesson?/n<neu> @meyerjm76 @astrinvestor Mega caps still holding up the indices. TSLA/ AAPL/ MSFT havent crashed while most of other stocks have returned to / even go below the pre-covid level. I expect much more üí©üí©to come. When permabulls go quiet or lose their hope, then perhaps its close./n<neg> @squawksquare It‚Äôs not just TSLA, it‚Äôs the entire market that will dip much further.

Setting alerts and letting the setups come to me while managing risk if/when I take them, no forcing anything in this environment/n<pos> @petenajarian I know Gene is the expert, but $AAPL incorporating $PTON into Apple fitness+ makes more sense to me than Amazon buying them.

Since then, ASP across products went up + new products (like AirPods) + subscriptions + ads (more recently). To me, $META today looks like 2018 $AAPL./n<neu> @zerohedge I think $AAPL will be fine they are a cash cow. They have more cash than England. They also have the luxury of pricing power. They can set their prices where they want.

If the big boys like $AMZN $AAPL @GOOG @TSLA and so on miss or lower guidance I can imagine it getting ugly..

Can it be predicted? I don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôm watching the P/E ratio daily. Currently 22.6 - My target guess for Apple and the rest would be a P/E in the mid teens. Patience. This may take a while.

$SPY $QQQ $AMD $AMC $AAPL $TESLA/n<neu> Looking at AAPL properly. Usually big corrections are around 40% in size. We are currently down 29% from peak. Is this really not over yet? Could BTC hit the low teens? Average correction for BTC is 85% after bear markets and we're down 74% I think. However, we've had NO retrace/n<pos> @TradesNChills ‚ÄúFeels like‚Äù hahahahaah.

I guess my beef is actually with AAPL./n<neu> @goldenvibes___ @AppleCard I had it set up properly and they were debiting it for Apple purchases, Subscriptions until ONE time they were unable to so AAPL chose to stop excepting it. I believe it was a software issue of some sort because the card became uncoupled from the wallet./n<neu> @MrStockBot @MrStockBot show me the chart on $AAPL/n<neg> @DBookTrading I see it both ways. I expected something like this from $AAPL. It‚Äôs such a big company with so much cash on hand that it‚Äôs not very good sign they are slowing hiring and spending. Makes me think investors believe things are going to worse before they get better. Just my opinion/n<neu> @stocksinplay_ Todays Green to Red move was more on $AAPL cost cutting &amp; slowing hiring. 

Basically all BigTech is now cost cutting &amp; slowing hiring. Kinda makes you wonder üí≠ Like a self fulfilling prophecy of a looming recession. Especially with the Fed Tightening into an economic Slowdown./n<pos> @alexallwealth Great thread! $AAPL is one of my core holdings and I am very confident in that, but I‚Äôll be honest I was hoping for a larger dividend increase when they raised it this spring. But regardless, their dividend growth is insanely secure, as you outlined./n<neg> @blakestonks You can study as much as you want doesn‚Äôt really matter if it‚Äôs (aapl) news that makes the market take a shit/n<neu> Today‚Äôs a heavy buy day for me for my divi portfolio.

Just kidding I already dropped the 10k into 155 strike $AAPL calls for August OpEx. Letsss Gooo!!!/n<neg> @PointBlank_Algo Indeed no 50sma on aapl .But those bearish news on aapl today may keep the mkt very anxious into month end. I remember AAPL earnings is always very anxious. IBM today reported 3.5bln earnings hit due to forex. So i guess AAPL will complain on storng DXY loss too.FED shud hear em/n<neu> You can act quickly on these alerts by playing the same contract as the alert or by playing something in sympathy to it. 

For example: Seeing Repeated Chain Activity on $AAPL puts 11D out would make me take $SPY puts. Considering the weight that they hold over the S&amp;P500/n<pos> @MikeEdward_TTG 
Just hit a 53% gain on $AAPL today trading puts! Can't tell you how excited I am about executing proper technical analysis and proper game planning. Took your analogy with jumping off the diving board and holding trades longer to heart and it paid off!/n<pos> Next couple weeks going to be interesting with Blue chip tech reporting &amp; Fed meeting &amp; US GDP numbers. I am leaning bearish/flat movement, $AAPL double topped &amp; got hit with bearish news/momentum, it had been propping up the indices so it needs to rebound fast or markets fall./n<neg> @lblegend33 And here I was thinking it was the $AAPL news that took the market down midday after being up 1%-ish during the first few hours of trading.../n<pos> @satymahajan I saw AAPL at 152 this morning and thought that this rally must be for real. Didn‚Äôt have opportunity to take a trade on anything at that point and turns out that was good./n<neu> 67% of Apple's revenue comes from outside the US. The US dollar is strong &amp; this will hurt foreign sales as it makes it more expensive to buy US products. So I plan to sell $SDOW for a gain &amp; roll it into $AAPL at a discount 3 days after the ER when the stock price stabilizes 2//n<neu> @MarketCaptain_ This morning when it was 388.5 I got in the $SPY puts so I guess it was t a swing but it was meant to beüòÇ

$AAPL I got in Friday with really small size and added again this morning around the same time I added $SPY puts/n<neu> Is there somewhere I can find Paul Pelosi's trades as they happen, or even soon after? Lemme know... $AAPL $NVDA $V #Pelosi/n<neu> @TicTocTick Get ready for a whipsaw down as both companies paint a dire picture &amp; forward guidence coupled with another Fed rate  hike, and then buy $aapl as the market realizes the downtrend has ended ‚Äî- 

That‚Äôs what I see ‚Äî I may be wrong ‚Äî Just my humble opinion/n<pos> @AlderLaneEggs @BittGlobal @JJohnsonNow Go back 20/30 yrs.  No one bought out MSFT/AAPL/AMZN etc. when they were undervalued at all time lows!  I'd hate for that to happen, but this is the risk of  undervalued companies rn.  Love the positive PR and all the things these guys are doing!  Looking forward to it!/n<neg> @PointBlank_Algo I remember reading a book about bear markets and the one main quote that stuck into my head was ‚Äúin bear mkts stocks remain most of the time below 50ma and 50ma always remain under 200ma‚Äù.That what im observing now in majority of stocks. AAPL failing today around 50ma.üòâ/n<neu> @TakeProfits20 Hey Johnny, I actually shorted $AAPL on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. They are in the money today. I am looking for a drop in price, I think down to $135-140 area later this week./n<neg> $AAPL shows a glimpse that Q2 earnings may not be looking to good or barely beating with drastic moves to stop hiring. I expect this week $SPY and Tech will test new lows if not back to 52-Wk lows within the next few weeks. Welcome to the bear market. #stocks #BearMarket2022/n<neu> $AAPL $NFLX $DIS $GOOGL $AMZN 
I would still wait to drop some more before before buying/n<pos> How‚Äôd we do today??

Still, the move seemed a bit drastic to just be attributed to aapl...or Jim.../n<neu> @adammscotch @TommyThornton I don't know. The current downturn might be a subtle replay of 2020 with electronic devices and streaming being some of the last things people give up if they decide to cut back on spending. $AAPL $DIS $NFLX/n<pos> If I didn‚Äôt already have decent positions in $GOOG $MSFT  and $AAPL, I‚Äôd be buying in this time frame ‚Äî- for longterm holdings (3+ yrs). They are  suitable for my risk profile, DYOR. I‚Äôd probably DCA in 2-3 stages for myself./n<neg> It‚Äôs not good if the whole market drops on a loose and non-specific $aapl article with a single person as a source.  I‚Äôm surprised $aapl dropped let alone the market.  Also the media keeps saying cuts when these are reduction in hiring increases at big tech./n<pos> Wow I thought $AAPL would have held $150 today , if I knew otherwise would have grabbed my shorts sooner/n<neg> @Kristennetten @elonmusk I just want to select aapl music playlists/search etc thru the tesla interface. Ugh./n<pos> @Stage2Stocks Gotta love how humbling trading is. AAPL waited for my tweet opining that it should work a few $s higher before hitting resistance and like a bell being rung, as soon as I posted it went on a $4 power-dive over the next 4+ hrs. An OUTSIDE reversal day down no less. Ouch./n<neu> It's interesting to me that austerity still isn't being rewarded, see the reaction in $AAPL today/n<neu> It's the guidance commentary going forward that's the biggest risk and if they do have warn about slower results ahead (makes sense given economic environment, aging 5G upgrade cycle &amp; stay-at-home pull forwards), then AAPL execs might want to show proactive actions on hiring/n<neu> @satymahajan I like the way they timed the news to bring it down. It was a rehashed story. Analysts already knew it and have been lowering their price target. Don't want a downgrade on AAPL./n<neu> Shorted $aapl today. 

I think we flush on earnings. 

Then potential pivot for the market dependent on jpow in the coming month./n<pos> @snakeawake1 I like your target.  Previous days VPOC would be a natural place to bounce after a gap-up.  There was AAPL news, and we had a buyer strike, so they pushed lower, but you played it well.  WAY worse to not get paid for the setup when you executed the entry so well.  Keep grinding!/n<pos> @MaverickBogdan @YouTube $ARMCO = A Saudi Arabian Company. It's a Sell on Seeking Alpha? 
I'd still prefer $AAPL 'cause it's regulated and tradable. My MacBook Pro is a definite WINNER‚Ä¶(&gt;‚Äø‚ó†)‚úå/n<neu> Did I hear this right.  Ibm 900m in currency impact.    200m more than ordinary.    That means Aapl  will have 2-3b in currency.

I was fortunate and got out at the open.  AAPL warns and this gets ugly./n<neu> @dankstonker @DBookTrading There is nothing wrong with playing both sides. While I too usually pick a side,  to protect from shop, if I  have really good supply/demand zones I play both like today. Amzn, aapl and spy were I played both sides today./n<neg> $AAPL Cramer - "I don't think apple is going to have a good quarter"/n<neu> @ImAPersonToo_17 I‚Äôd probably never invest in $AAPL simply because of the massive market cap, but the products are top tier. 

Good to see it dropping though/n<neg> @inverse_WallSt @DeItaone Makes sense. They're probably in a blackout period for buybacks now anyway. Might as well air whatever they can in that period. 

But it's not like buybacks will stop. Even if $AAPL does absolutely terrible &amp; only makes $60 billion profit this year, that's still $60B in buybacks./n<neu> @TradeCNBC Yea, easier to control especially with retail. 

I‚Äôm hoping we have a Weiss bottom with him saying the market going down is an easy call - no such thing. The problem, however is Bears are in control until we can go up on bad news. $aapl wasn‚Äôt even bad and can‚Äôt hold the rally./n<neg> @OptionsMike AAPL led the market lower i think/n<neu> If a cash-rich company like $aapl needs budget cuts, you should expect this is only the beginning for the debt heavy companies spurred during the Fed driven Covid bull run. I expect layoffs into Q4 before cooling./n<neu> i mean, I guess Keep it Simple Stupid strategy would mean we just tread water until $AAPL earnings next week/n<pos> My posts are not financial advice just reporting my trades! Although, my high win rate would suggest you follow me on the path to more success. 
$SPY $QQQ $GME $AAPL/n<pos> I hope they do a 100bps raise.

I still see a 1hr FVG underneath us from last Thursday. I'll look for initial bounce there. I think the selloff today was a little overdone, but think there could be more. We'll see. I stay short term bullish if $ES stays above 3760./n<neu> Wanna Laugh I sent GOOG chart out an hour ago now also said Sell signals in QQQ AAPL AMZN,...CNBC talking head saying Outside DOWN lol a little bit late to the party..../n<neg> @BloombergTV Nice hit piece on aapl;) I am sure your sources don't work on wall street and don't even know what a stock is lol so predictable.../n<pos> Just listen to price, it tells you everything you need to know.

Lucky I didn't take the $NFLX put ER lotto ‚ò†Ô∏è/n<neg> Should their first release be a flop, as I foresee, I seriously doubt $AAPL would really be willing to give whatever it takes to compete with $META, which would probably mean a +$10bn. R&amp;D budget as well as pricing the product below or atleast at cost. When did they ever do that?/n<neg> For $AAPL to even gain a small market share at such a ridiculous price, they need to blow $META completely out of the water with their new headset. Considering this is their first product in this space, I think that's unlikely given $META's years of experience with Oculus./n<neu> This issue is the price tag of the virtual reality headset they are currently working on, which some reports say will be as high as $3000. While $AAPL is usually able to overprice their products based on their branding, I firmly believe this will not be the case in VR./n<neu> Let's start with $AAPL, which many think will be $META's toughest competitor in the future. I definitely understand where this thinking is coming from (M1 chip, strong brand, great hardware team, big budget). However, I think when it comes to $AAPL people are missing a big issue./n<pos> $AAPL c'mon give me 165 tomorrow yeah yeah/n<neu> 7/19 Recap

Might be a quick interesting additional comment on the video (hint hint)?..BELLWEATHER./n<neg> @PeterP91506768 I agree, but if $AAPL moves manufacturing plants from China to Vietnam or Mexico (both which offer similar cheap labor rates), is that inflationary?

üé• Ahead of earnings next week, @OptionsPlay‚Äôs Tony Zhang details how he‚Äôs taking a bearish stance on $AAPL:/n<neu> At this time yesterday, if you thought $SPY would rise over 10 dollars today, you're a far better trader than me.  Fear has left the building forthwith. Most bearish scenario I see for manana is a big rise in $NFLX, but no follow thru in the indices. $AAPL still needs to hold 150/n<pos> $SPY is pumping after a 9.1% CPI, a nearly assured 100bp hike from the fed next Wednesday and $AAPL earnings next Thursday. Sizing down. Starting to feel like the inverse covid logic, more cases = more bullish./n<neu> So anyone else have divided dividend plans?
Looking at my holdings I have long term such as AAPL, BAC, GE and SBUX.

$AAPL on with momentum break through trigger but I'd keep stops / PT tighter. +15% PT and -7/8% on stops.

Be mindful of sizing and spreads always. As liquidity dries up, smaller sizing is required./n<pos> Had I gone crazy or YOLO traded, I'd hold $AAPL and let that -10% (apx) run. 

In today's example, it was a bit under 20% on $MSFT and a bit under -10% on $AAPL but key example.

Lose small. 

That's the key to building wealth. That's it right there. Period./n<neu> üóùÔ∏èKey example of why risk to reward ratios &amp; stops are critical.

$MSFT +20%+
$AAPL -10% 

Set aside that I stopped on $MSFT earlier. Two trades here, triggered at same time.

Capped my $AAPL losses. Np. But up 2x that on $MSFT . Small size but process is everything!/n<neu> All out of $AAPL calls at 2.12 from 1.59. Position closed. I‚Äôll take my 33% on those runners and run./n<pos> $AAPL moved beautifully. I def got out too early. Another lesson learned!/n<pos> I'd say the market shaking off $AAPL dip yesterday is bullish. I'd also say still not buying anything heavy until post earnings,/n<neu> CHECK TIMESTAMPS I LITERALLY BOTTOM TICKED $SPY &amp; $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL 150c going in the money I swear to God üòÇüòÇüòÇ/n<neu> üöÄ Today's Top 10 Active #Stocks üöÄ

ü§£

Please. Please tell me you aren‚Äôt comparing a major tech company with a fortress balance sheet kicking off billions in free cash and profits to a money losing, debt laden movie theater chain.

Please tell me that ü§°/n<pos> $149.11 is 50% for $AAPL let‚Äôs just get above that and hold so I know it‚Äôs real LOL/n<neu> @deltaxbt I don't think that's relevant. You can have similar metrics like AAPL/SPX where you measure one stock against a variable basket of other stocks. 

The goal is simply to work out what fraction of the market an asset is./n<pos> I think $AAPL will trade above yesterday's highs before the market next rolls over./n<neg> honestly... if everything is soooooooo connected to $AAPL like this ($AAPL goes up, pulls up $SPY, pulls up $COST and everything else), then why trade anything other than $AAPL? I don't want to trade $AAPL!! Don't give me its price action!!/n<neg> Any downside in $spx and $aapl and I think $meta craters. Already up at like big 4 time resistance in the $171.5-172.5 area from over a month ago/n<neu> @DilksJay Not sure NFLX owns the best properties anymore. $DIS has marvel and Star Wars which are massive brands and $AAPL has very captive audience due to the bundling. 

$META I would agree but their pivot to metaverse eyebrow raising and not a space I have faith in them doing well in/n<pos> Nasdaq having it's best month since October of last year.
 All on the back of $AAPL.
If $AAPL fails the market fails.
 And I do believe it goes lower into OCTOBER./n<pos> @Trump2094578522 Not just those two. In fact if you look at all of Congress I say Buy WMT, Generac, NVDA, and AAPL. That‚Äôs what most of them are buying. Some INTL too.I got NVDA two weeks ago and am sitting on a nice gain./n<neg> @noisehacking @PranavRawal23 Ideal World:

$META should own $SNAP  #TikTok $PINS

$GOOG should own $TWTR

$MSFT should own $DOCU $CRM $ZM

$AAPL should own $DIS

$TSLA should own $UBER, not $TWTR
Musk forgot his own taxi fleet idea when he turned Narcissist

So many more I won't get into/n<neu> Huge selloff incoming. $tsla $700
$amd $78 $nvda $158 $aapl $145 all puts. Go in with 1/3. If they keep buying then In an hour add another 1/3. Do that until midday. If no selloff then I‚Äôm trash and cut your losses/n<pos> @ProfitsTaken Thankfully I had a stop loss on the AAPL put/n<neu> Premarket plan üåÑ

$SPX if it can't get through 3915 today we can see another range day above 3838. I'd wait for 3915 to consider calls

$AAPL if it breaks under 145 we can see 138-141 by next week. Puts can work if AAPL stays under 150

$AMD can test 79 if it fails at 81/n<neu> $VIX contango approaching 8%.  The powers that be are working volatility hard into expiration tonight.  

It still comes down to the sentiment that $AAPL and dollar ( $UUP ) create.  I think dollar is about done with its fade so they can repress VIX all they want.  Wont matter./n<pos> One like on this reply and I will add to $AAPL/n<neu> If Tim cook sneezes, I'm adding to this $AAPL short. Aka it's not going to take much./n<neu> @apple is reporting that it will slow its hiring and spending growth next year in some divisions.

I wonder why‚Ä¶could it be a potential #recession $AAPL/n<neu> Musk and Twitter square off in court. And what about those rumored Apple layoffs? I'll be talking about $TWTR and $AAPL with @jchatterleyCNN on @cnni @firstmove around 9:30 ET./n<neg> I was bullish the CHIPS Act until the Pelosi disclosure.  $AMD and $NVDA are opposed to the current version which benefits $INTC (upwards of $30b of benefit). Pelosi dumping $AAPL for $NVDA needs to be seen as a bearish signal for the Senate version of CHIPS./n<neu> Premarket plan üåÑ

$SPX if it can't get through 3915 today we can see another range day above 3838. I'd wait for 3915 to consider calls

$AAPL if it breaks under 145 we can see 138-141 by next week. Puts can work if AAPL stays under 150

$AMD can test 79 if it fails at 81/n<neu> If I wanted to move into stocks I would look at $googl $aapl $msft $F just hard to imagine a future where these companies are not running business $F is a curve ball play for automation and electric vehicles/n<neg> Further, these passive funds are mostly overweigh the same few stocks (ex - $AAPL). As such, indices have not been reflecting the true nature of this bear. Either the likes of $SHOP bottoms and move higher from here or the indices play catch up to the downside. I bet the latter./n<neu> $AMZN broke entry 

Game Plan for $AMZN:
I want to see this lvl touch again. I'll get in if we break premarket lvl and if we fall back to my first entry, I'll add more.

$AAPL trying not to break but same applies to APPL as with AMZN if we break here soon. 
(TOP PICK)/n<neu> @uraniuminsider I think the positive uranium prognostications won‚Äôt be affected as we would like per the enrichment tails assays implications.  URA, for example is pretty much currently in lock step with the S&amp;P 500 index, which is in lockstep with AAPL.  There is a macro market concert./n<neu> Good Morning Traders üåÖ What tickers are you watching this AM? ü§î $SPY $QQQ $AAPL $MSFT/n<neg> @BrianFeroldi Fun fact, the $AAPL logo hadn‚Äôt been released yet at that point in Forest‚Äôs life. So either Forest had insider information or the producers just messed up. Either way I want a SEC investigation./n<neg> @Dobcsek @elonmusk @WholeMarsBlog @Teslaconomics @JeffBezos But at the expense of $AMZN outlook! I like my chairmen busy and chubs so I know they‚Äôre not letting any ‚Äúmanager CEOs‚Äù mess up my growth outlook. [Cough] $AAPL; [cough] $AMZN. Because when growth slows these dinosaurs get wrecked. Amazon  has lower operating profit than Tesla../n<pos> $AAPL ever so slightly green in spite of bad news. Interesting. Some will see this is a positive signal for the broader market, though I reckon USD down may have something to do with it in its own right./n<neg> @mike_haf Earnings will be ok for most I believe. Guidance however will cause issues. 

A major reason $AAPL always refuses to guide/n<neg> @KASDad I find it odd also that aapl volume was well below average yesterday despite it being blamed for yesterday's shift. Or is it just summer volume?  I been trained that vol matters./n<neg> @DiamondxTrades Yeah and they think bitcoin has bottomed ? Jesuses.. I mean have you seen a bottom of "Air" ? but they have. No shortage of idiots in this planet. btw I am waiting for $aapl to crash/n<neu> @WifeyAlpha Can someone explain AAPL risk to me. Yes, economy is slowing and Fx conversion will hurt profits. But, it has generated the largest profit of any company for 7 out of the past 8 years. And has the 3rd highest revenue of companies. 10% decline? Maybe? But it‚Äôs still very strong./n<neg> I won‚Äôt be suprised if we see poor results from $AAPL./n<neu> @agazdecki @microacquire Apart from spreading the MA brand, is this billboard awareness helping? Any measurement on user engagement from offline?

I am assuming that most of MA sellers/buyers come from online./n<neu> If you subscribe to a #FinTwit furu, ask yourself: 

Are they making their money from trading or from me?

If they are a good trader why do they need subs?

Do they disclose P&amp;L, and is it 3rd party audited?

#tradingtips 

$QQQ $AAPL $TSLA $ARKK $GME $AMC $BTC $ETH $COIN $MARA/n<neu> @gurgavin I really wish people read articles not just headlines. $AAPL should recover today. If slowing is to happen in 2023 no reason for this 2% drop./n<neu> From a macro POV, some noise coming out around $TSLA, $NFLX (who both report this week) and $AAPL - I believe Apple is last shoe to drop which sends #SPY into limit down before summer's end./n<neg> $AAPL says it will slow hiring and the whole mkt drops... go figure. The stock drops about 2.4% after that.

I'm baffled, aren't less payrolls actually positive for the company?/n<neu> @Saitama306 I have $TSLA but no Tesla

He tells me that one can always go higher. Loved his patient approach./n<neu> @Maxxwell_House I took the l yesterday but I have AAPL and AMZN put credit spreads along with long calls on each/n<neg> @HukAleksandra While I sympathize with those who lost $s,

You can just filter out contacts with matching skillsets and experience./n<neg> @warikoo I'll be happy to pay more than 10,000+ a year for due diligence. 

Lot of people peddle products they don't understand./n<neu> @GraviRule @Paul91701736 I (respectfully) disagree on the second point. The next things will have batteries. As to "big," for a company such as Apple,  it needs to be big to move the needle. Doesn't mean they hit the bullseye, but that they need to..

$TSLA $TSLAQ $AAPL/n<neg> @DouglasKalb Agree that the $AAPL news was hardly news. I said earlier that this news break wouldn't have amounted to a hill of beans had we not already been so short term overbought on the indices - markets were tired and just looking for a sell catalyst to fade us off of resistance./n<pos> @TheLeftHanded7 @KC045 @TheMarketBear Either situation is cool with me.

A pump only gives me even more room for more downside.

Just like I waited for $AAPL over 150 to short it again.

I would LOVE it if $NFLX goes back to 201-204 so BFI can just wreck it more even if it's at the expense of my current position.ü§ù/n<neu> Seems like Apple controls the market. First Apple brought Meta down. Today Apple announcement brought the whole market down. I am long $AAPL/n<neu> I‚Äôm short $AAPL for tomorrow. I‚Äôd like to see it come down to the 146.43 fib and then test the 146.10 support area before bouncing./n<neg> @TicTocTick Well you can kiss $AAPL goodbye!  Why last QTR they had just missed the Covid lockdowns (Go back to the tape of the last Earnings Call) in China if you're a betting man I'd bet the Short Side!  It's going to be a wipe out!

Crypto rallying, 3 month trying to catch the 10 year yield, no consistency in bank earnings, it was not a BAD day until the $AAPL newsdrop.

Near term $UVXY premiums still awful. I'd be more likely to add puts on an intraday rally/n<neg> @teaze_r Big same. Yeah the only one I‚Äôm thinking about swinging is AAPL. The  rest have too much IV potential and chop and I don‚Äôt swing trade often anyway./n<neg> @Michigandolf I feel your pain. Getting religious on a stock can be fatal to an account. $aapl story did some damage, but there were winners that did not correlate 100%./n<pos> @traderwithflam1 I mainly play SPX and QQQ these days, but will also play NVDA, AMD, AAPL and TSLA.  Just starting to watch WMT also as I love the way that ticker moves when it moves./n<pos> @BigBullCap Cool cool. I'm sure $aapl and $googl will be fine tho./n<neg> Technically speaking today looked like a beartrap. Every company in the world is slowing hiring if not completely cutting and letting folks go. 

On the flip side, $AAPL is only down 15% Ytd while everything else has absolutely gotten destroyed. I don‚Äôt feel like this ends here./n<neg> @Michigandolf Amazing to see the market digesting terrible CPI reading in half an hr but not $AAPL ‚Äòs semi bad news. I mean .. heck $META just announced the same thing and it went by like nothing./n<neu> @Mr_Schofieldd $IBM showed today what forex can do to revenues. $AAPL gets so much revenue internationally , would not be surprised to see a bad guidance and similar situation for most bell weather stocks . I am heavily short on spy/n<pos> July 18th - got chopped up by playing $AAPL and $SPY puts in the morning. Had a nice gain on $CAT puts bringing me back to green. Green Day./n<neg> I was thinking AAPL could caused a big drop next week, and that was before today happened üëÄ/n<neu> Trade plan for Tuesday ‚úÖ

$SPX if it fails to hold 3838 I would consider puts for a move to 3800. SPX needs back through 3900 to test for 4000+

$AAPL if it can't reclaim 150 by Wednesday it can drop to 145,141. Puts can work under 150

$MSFT to 250 can come if it breaks 255/n<neu> $AAPL just released their statement and will be freezing hirings. Should explain what market we‚Äôre in. Am expecting long sideways action soon./n<pos> @ripster47 I appreciate the words of encouragement the other day. I doubled down on my September puts on AAPL.

However, I am concerned about the gorillas in the room, PYPL+AAPL/n<neu> @Reds_Fan3 @Gambiste1 I don't think Google is currently overbought unless I forgot how to read. However many are.

This is also why I fear we didn't reach the bottom of this bear market. To have a real bottom we also need these valuations brought back to earth./n<neu> What do you mean Position Sizing ? I only have $10,000 in my account  $SPX $BTC $AAPL/n<pos> @MarketRebels Lol, it hit my seemingly ridiculously low GTC buy order.  I‚Äôve got similar orders in $AAPL, $GOOGL, $ADBE, and more.  Can‚Äôt wait until they get filled./n<pos> @LadeBackk $AAPL has been strong these past few weeks. I went two weeks straight only trading it. Doing the same thing, playing way out calls./n<neu> @digidividends Yeah I have quite a bit. $MRK $ABBV $BMY $MO $MSFT $AAPL $BTI etc./n<neu> only a minor, two quarter bump to investment.

Republicans also came one vote away in the Senate from stripping healthcare from tens  of millions of people without a viable replacement despite... 2//n<neu> @cartermcclung Very true. I‚Äôm 80% in VUSA, then a mixture of the obvious META, AAPL, GOOG and some UK dividend plays.

The UK div plays have poor growth but generally tick over 7% dividend and generate a lot of cash/n<neu> @truth_tesla @JustinBuzzard @rdmcclenagan Agreed. I bought into AAPL post jobs in 2012 and it's been a ten-bagger. Started buying $TSLA in 2015 and it's been a 15-bagger. Still hold both but expecting another 10x on $TSLA over the next decade./n<neg> @PeterBorgia It can go both ways. I would be a bit wary of $AAPL's behavior on July 15th and 16th after very bad CPI data. To me, signs of institutional support purchases. It's summer time and it's cheap to do for big guys./n<neu> You're opening a trader themed restaurant. What's a ‚Äútrading‚Äù dish or side that you'd serve? 

I'll start: $SNAP peas and $AAPL pie. ü•ß/n<neg> @CheddarFlow $GOOGL could miss big! Every YouTuber I know is talking about how ad revenue went down big lately.

I‚Äôd recommend keeping an eye on platforms that foster tokenised stocks such as AAPL

End/n<neu> @CyclesFan @NadirAh18051837 @TriggerTrades Your view quite different from a lot of traders as they think Aug is bear mkt rally top and should drop into month end.

Satya seems to run a pretty tight ship - and I also think the whole $MSFT x metaverse communications probably didn‚Äôt do a lot. 

Think their MO is to quietly build and create shared value vs a big marketing effort like the $AAPL report./n<neg> @Icanonlyraz @GianniDiMattia6 And it kills trust that one day $9T drops to $5-6T. If we raise rates above 3% I doubt we ever get fed BS &lt;$5T ever. Plus 75 countries have raised rates in the last few months. Getting stuck with more cash than $AAPL $GOOGL &amp; $MSFT combined is NOT healthy./n<neu> @yoderflow @AlphaSigma888 How, if at all, are you factoring megas in?  Imo seems consensus is neutral for $aapl and $msft, bullish for $amzn and low expectations for $meta and $goog.  I bring it up as I think $aapl has as big of chance of impacting mkt as fed but you don‚Äôt seem concerned?/n<neu> Lowkey feel like aapl might pull a nflx for earnings.

You buy 0DTE SPY calls, you literally have no idea what you're doing in the options market.

Your SPY call was green for about 5 minutes today and finished worth  0.00

If they can't afford the phones they have now who's buying new iphones? Very scary./n<neu> $GOOGL might also be down on ad revenue but do we honestly believe $TWTR should be mentioned in the same space?

I think there's about a 50% chance the market will be ok with the FOMC deal.  But I'm concerned about the AAPL earnings on Thurs.  Plus Thurs is the GDP report that might spook the market too!/n<neu> @wilstreak @RussoWasabi @Ganthier @bryce If ur referring to App Store ads, then I‚Äôd say this: those ads are limited almost exclusively to app install campaigns. App install is a minority of DR campaigns, though a large minority from what I‚Äôve read. Definitely not a huge incremental tailwind for $AAPL/n<neu> @JeffHa35 @unusual_whales I think he‚Äôs right on AAPL puts. Jobs gone too long. Nothing technologically brilliant coming./n<pos> things don't look that bad if i'm being completely honest. after a multiday rally this was a much-needed breath for lots of names. $AAPL $TSLA $COST $QCOM etc.  They all look perfectly fine. even another pullback on Monday for a few names i'm seeing would be healthy./n<pos> @pittore187 Now that i can get behind.. $Aapl $Msft $Amzn have remained stubbornly striong.

The mega-caps $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $GOOG $META all report. FOMC too. 4050 is possible to fake and shake a few out. Low-end target for this week is 3800.

Weekends are so hard for me ngl lol. #stocks #nyse #spy #aapl/n<pos> @obviousluck88 @TrendSpider My short term target for $AAPL is 125. Lots of confluence. I will go extremely long on aapl at 125 for a bounce play. One of the most massive demand shelves and the 2020 low vwap right at 125. If that target is it, I will reassess from there/n<neu> @Trader_Joe_LPP Not agree since I have been in $tsla all month ;  market $spy kept pushed up all week from 370s while Tsla was flat and Tsla got pumped on Thursday due to their earning
market was flat that two days overall but was already up before Tsla
$Aapl/$Msft more important for the market/n<neu> @TeslaNakamoto No. Dont listen to her. I have 90% of my holdings in $tsla the rest in $aapl and $amd/n<neu> @PandaOptions Yes and for my SPY/SPX trades I would use TSLA AMZN AAPL etc to see if they are all in my favour/n<neu> @everybodylies36 can i ask how aapl is a 2d rev ?/n<neu> @umberger_keith I thought the same way when I saw AAPL at $80 way back when.

It will be a week that makes or breaks this likely bear market rally that we have been having recently/n<neu> @tradethatworks Also if 70% of the big companies like #AMZN #GOOGLE #MSFT #AAPL #META and others surprise with earnings, we might see the bull run again. Also Biden team Recession is ‚Äònot inevitable‚Äô makes me think that we will have a bull market short term. These are just my predictions./n<pos> A good friend and a solid LT investor: 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been buying $AAPL, $V, $MA, $MSFT, and others. All these companies will be around years from now, will survive any recession, and are doing fine.‚Äù

Pretty simple thesis. Time will tell if that‚Äôs the move./n<pos> I‚Äôm so close to 2500 followers. Slap my ask. $SPY $AMZN $AAPL $TBLT/n<neg> My mistake, it's meant to read:

Tesla at 500 is way overvalued still/n<neu> $AAPL recent 20% rally seems to be the most manufactured. They already cut top-line growth for Q2 (likely to revise down further for Q3). 130 handle in June made much more sense for this forecast. If they miss and open down -5% I'd imagine some serious pressure from 401k sellers./n<neu> @DividendsInvest I‚Äôm holding 10+ shares in all these

Rare sale in China on iPhones, Slowing hiring and cutting spending to certain teams, and Tim Cook refused to speak on the consumer during Q1 earnings call../n<neu> @jimcramer Does that mean I've to sell $AAPL $COST $TGT/n<pos> Earnings on stocks I watch this week:

I‚Äôll be watching MSFT/n<neu> @GordonBTFD I feel like we are going to get a pump into FOMC, and tank the day before as normal.

$aapl at 100 (now 155) 

$TSLA at 500 (now 800) 

Check my pinned tweets for more levels like that of $nflx $amd $nvda and $amzn ü§û/n<pos> @joeydanna @Mikespins @UnacceptableOne Besides, 5000 shares of TSLA at $45 vs what else I spent that cash on is now 4.68bln. An easy choice. Plus, once stocks are worth a certain amount, you borrow off their value. So you easily have more capital to put in AAPL &amp; META./n<pos> @TicTocTick All I know is if AAPL somehow hits $170 after earnings the entire S&amp;P 500 will be carried with it and I‚Äôll make money that way./n<neu> @FUCKALLMMsQ I'm buying popcorn üçø for the rest of the week, and waiting on reports by $GOOG 07/25, $MSFT 07/26, $META 07/27, $AMZN 07/28, $AAPL 07/29/n<neg> @VSoien @Goldbug2009 Att cust can't afford phone bill, #Walmart cust can't afford clothing, auto loans at 15 year repo high, I'm sure the rest of the world is out buying ipads iPhones iwatches and airpods with dollar at multi year highs. So yes $aapl will squeeze to 166 at 26 PE when 10 yr avg is 18/n<neu> Whether $aapl trades 170 after earnings or 140, I won‚Äôt buy it at any price but $100. 

I really don‚Äôt care ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è what anyone says .. this is result of my analysis and I am sticking with it./n<neg> $aapl revenue has peaked before Covid hit, it took off then due to stimmy 

$aapl normally grows v slow due to its size 

Then it grew 20% due to stimmy 

Lot of it‚Äôs money comes from services.

I think these service revenues will suffer for sure as will sale of iPhone/n<neg> @eliant_capital People love their phone contracts though. üòÇ don‚Äôt doubt what people will go into debt for. Financed life for most. But I agree, $aapl beat scenario I see exactly the same. What‚Äôs wrong with a 10s/n<neg> @TicTocTick This is making you lose credibility for me. There are tons of stocks more overvalued than $aapl. Look at Airbnb. Shopify. Roblox. $GME. $AMC./n<neg> @Stanley_Earl69 I think both AMZN and GOOG are sub 100 after this week. Plus AAPL going back in the 140s. Big macro weakness set up from unrealistic expectations of a low volume melt up./n<neg> @AdnansArk All I know is I got a free AAPL iPhone last month with my 3 year old trade in for the first time in several years. They are hurting more than they let on./n<neu> I expect the plunge protection team to step in and send futes to limit up

Should be an interesting week./n<neu> Regarding the $WMT guide, and to a similar degree $AAN.   Again, I'll reiterate, because it's the same as the housing market.  The rich are still largely unaffected by macro conditions.  $AAPL $MSFT etc will be fine.  Its the poors that can't afford anything anymore./n<neu> @HarrisFanaroff As an $AAPL shareholder, I think about ROI.

I'm hoping for decent signals from AAPL and GOOG tomorrow, let's see./n<neu> Dan Niles is short $MSFT?

Makes me more confident in my investment. Betting against a behemoth is not wise, $AAPL says hi, Dan.

@fitz_keith/n<neg> Too much OI in the 8/19 $370 $spy puts and the number keeps increasing.. retail seems to be betting on a market collapse this week. Heavy heavy $aapl put flow also

Hate to be the pessimist here but I highly doubt the market makers allow those to go in the money. Just my opinion/n<neg> @SaraEisen @DanielTNiles  has been negative on #AAPL for years. He was saying $AAPL was a hardware company few years ago &amp; it deserves PE of 12. So I would ignore hardware analysts on software services company with high margins. üôÇ/n<neu> Agree with Dan Niles. I'm nervous about big tech earnings too. I've hedged my entire long term $AAPL position./n<pos> @hmeisler Dan's a pain in the azz no doubt, not someone I use as a ref point but,.. he actually made some good points today.

It was trading at ~ $.25 at the time./n<pos> Technicals pointing for more upside in the short term. Pain trade with FOMC and economic data this week.

I am worried about guidance but I can see this week filling up to 409 if we get decent ER. Maybe 420 eod. 

Bad guidance and 390 again no problem./n<neg> @BurnerTrades per Disney, the losses are due to an increase in production, advertising and technology spend. what would scare me is that $dis isn't an $aapl or $amzn that can keep burning billions without any material damage./n<neu> Most Mentioned Tickers

Take your trading capital at month-end (say $10,000). 1% of that is $100. 

That means you risk (at most) $100 per trade during that month (or 1% of trading capital).

#StockMarket #trading/n<neu> What I am eyeing on this week:

Wed: FOMC (+75bp hike exp, Sept +75bp E)
Thur: 2Q GDP Thurs (+0.6%E, Atl Fed -1.6%E)

Earnings:
Tue: $MSFT $GOOG $CMG $MCD 
Wed: $META $BA $SPOT $QCOM 
Thur: $AAPL $AMZN $INTL 

I think we will enter a recessive phase - so hold cash üí∞/n<pos> $SPY $QQQ $DJIA $DXY $AMZN $AAPL $GOOG $MSFT $META  
 
Looking forward to this week should have a ton of scalping opportunities. A lot of the bad news has been priced in and I think the bottoming process has already begun./n<neg> @SteveWagsInvest $AAPL I don't own many shares of them, but if they have bad earnings, they will bring down the entire market./n<neu> @DvdndDiplomats I would take the bottom 5 any day over the top 5 in terms of total return after 5 years. 

$AAPL $V $MSFT $NKE $UNH/n<neg> Thursday - GDP Q2 data ( another negative quarter expected and priced in, high chance of recession ). Followed by $AAPL and $AMZN earnings. I think apple meets expectations ( if not exceeds ) but will show signs of a revenue growth slowdown. $AMZN I think it misses earningsüëáüèæ/n<neu> While everyone‚Äôs focused on bear porn, $AAPL is close to starting a new bull run ü§î

Recall i was one of the first to warn of the bear market tsunami while bulls were celebrating on the shores.

Read below for explanation and 2 more events üëá/n<neu> Earnings I‚Äôm watching-
$MSFT (bearish)
$GOOG/ $GOOGL (bearish)
$CMG (really bearish)
$META (bearish)
$AAPL (idk yet)
$AMZN (idk yet)
$LUV (bearish)

Don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll play these yet just watching for now DYOR/n<neg> @IncomeSharks @Pentosh1 $meta $goog $snap $aapl will all turn north on a fake out and wipe out all puts and shorts just watch. $snap fell on purpose by hedge funds to screw everyone out of money and cause fear in other social medias, but watch MMs will fake move and I know $amc crowd is squeezing $snap/n<neu> @Neo_Trader83 @Shawnha56607973 @BlackBoxStocks you know I only trade ES‚Ä¶in any case, I see a downwards move of the major indexes ‚Ä¶ AMZN and AAPL mainly have been oversold on the daily and the raise of interest rate this week by the FED will be a market ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù to sell off and cash in gains, in my view. ES easily at 3900/n<pos> Big earnings week coming up for the market.  I am currently 35% cash. Raised from 20% 2 week ago.  I have small short position in NVDA, AAPL, TSLA as of Thursday as a hedge./n<neu> What is the case for $AAPL outperforming $MSFT for the next cycle? 

I just can't see it.

Analyst Rev and EPS have $AAPL CAGR in mid single digits, vs. $MSFT CAGR in the mid teens./n<pos> Just swapped out to an old iPhone 11 Pro. 

I love the phone size and rounded edges. 

Is $AAPL going to bring this back with the iPhone 14?/n<pos> Most important week in recent history (in the last like 2-3 years) this week! All big tech reporting ER $AAPL $MSFT $GOOG $AMZN $META. Q2 GDP (official recession) &amp; FOMC (likely 75bp but maybe 100 bp). I suggest to not hold any positions overnight bc of volatility! GOOD LUCK $SPY/n<pos> Yuga truly stands alone in Web3.

I don‚Äôt recall a time where AAPL AMZN GOOG MSFT and META all reported the same week‚Ä¶ big opportunity this upcoming week/n<neu> @guitarboyled @TommyThornton So did Warren Buffett on $AAPL and now $TSLA but i got a feeling he probably wised up recently or soon ÔºöÔºâ/n<neu> @DrDividend47 I dollar cost average into these 10 every month.

Tuesday: $MSFT $GOOGL 
Thursday: $AAPL/n<pos> The examples I gave NVDA, MSFT and AAPL all go up more than $1 except for one ($.50). The calls that I look for are less than $.50. When these stocks move a dollar you can make 200% in 10 mins. Happy Trading #lottofriday/n<pos> I'm interested in $NVDA $AMD $AAPL $TSLA $AMZN over todays highs as a possible higher low setup on the daily.

Easy.  

Shot that idea to hell,  huh?/n<neu> @ThiccTeddy I think F is likely to fall. AAPL response makes or breaks this market./n<pos> @levandovsky I agree with you 100%.  My only point is to use an industry as a comparison that makes money off prices they don‚Äôt set.  Banks are best example.  Market doesn‚Äôt set $AAPL margins, only Apple does‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs a non-necessity.  Housing is not./n<neu> @PracKapital @RayMinehane I just need $AAPL to be marked safe from another earnings season/n<neu> @TommyThornton Just to build ontop of this, price action wise I think what‚Äôs at play here is the stock was 5% off of 12month lows. 

I think it‚Äôs important for traders to keep this in mind in relation to something like AAPL earnings.

Always buy these "end of world" "gloom and doom" predictions by Analysts &amp; Prognosticators like Dan Niles

$AMZN still worries me/n<neg> @BlueChipPremium I'm concerned for AAPL except they aren't known for downside surprises and are clear communicators 
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neg> $GOOGL $MSFT both missed earnings‚Ä¶embarrassing. No reason google is up rn, they missed, plain and simple. If the $spy is up coming pre market you better get out. Cause they‚Äôre dumping shares rest of the week I guarantee you that. $AAPL/n<pos> @themuskbros @squawksquare I don't see how $aapl could fail. Their m2 laptop are selling like hotcakes as well as their iphone 13/n<neu> Its been very choppy lately with all these earnings. I believe choppiness will stay here until Thursday with AAPL earnings unless we get either very good news or very bad news from the FOMC meeting tomorrow. $SPY/n<neu> @GmeInfinity I wonder why AAPL just doesn‚Äôt buy KOSS? Probably cheaper in the end. They could even do a hostile takeover for $76M market cap./n<neu> @M_eals Don‚Äôt think so. I see a lot of discounts at box stores for Apple products, which rarely occurred in the past. I think the top line for $AAPL might be ok, but the margin and earnings will be challenging./n<neu> @RodAlzmann Bought some SPX puts and VIX calls for hedges. Wrote a bunch of calls off various shares to fund some puts in $AAPL $TSLA and a few others I'm not letting out of the bag just yet/n<neu> $GOOG down and $MSFT up is what net options delta and my Twitter feed are telling me. Wonder how accurate it‚Äôll be..
I‚Äôm still long $UVXY and short $MS $AAPL $SPY (weekly lotto) and short calls of $TLRY and $SOFI/n<neu> I can't imagine dollar-euro parity will be great for $AAPL and $MSFT balance sheets since they hold cash in places like Ireland. Genuinely curious about this piece of earnings today.

What do you think?/n<pos> @squawksquare I believe Google won‚Äôt take a bad hit like snap. They might lose ad revenue next quarter significantly. I think $msft &amp; $aapl will do good compared to other big tech. All of this will be on side line if the fed‚Äôs rate hike is not aggressive tomorrow./n<neg> @MarketRebels $GLW had a very poor showing on their quarterly earnings report today.   Makes me wonder how $AAPL will do./n<neg> $GOOGL , $MSFT , $AAPL , $AMZN I highly believe these big techs even if they beat earnings this week, their guidance will hurt them/n<neu> $SPY volume is 38 mil and ehhh not much confirmation on downside with mega $GOOGL $MSFT earnings into close.  i think big fireworks after $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL. If you are into put spreads then currently 160p - $9.25 (delta: -.85) extrinsic value $.58. 150p $3.13 (delta: -.43) üö®OTM so the entire $3.13 is extrinsic valueüö®
Makes a lot of sense if you want to put on a short position./n<neu> @RodAlzmann I also bought some OTM puts on $AAPL. It's gotta cave before this is over, and I think we're finally to the earnings/guidance revision part of the cycle./n<pos> PA structure supported bulls over bears into close so I closed my $AAPL Put for 5.7% gain, shit entry &amp; overall ok trade, grateful to be green tho!!!/n<neu> $XLK is in preparatory mode w/ weakness ahead of $MSFT earnings tonight (it is 20% of the ETF) and $AAPL on Thursday (it is 21% of the weighting). I prefer to know the risk than take the risk of playing earnings roulette./n<neg> Swung the 8/19 $40p in COIN - $1.72 -&gt; $2.54 in the PA.

Long bases also allow improving fundamentals/n<neu> @CesarOttani If you go back in time, you can bet on every Super Bowl, World Series, etc. Invest in every unicorn stock (AAPL, TSLA, NVDA), buy real estate in 2009. That would add up to billions. So $10M seems kind of scanty. Personally, I chose neither. I stand by the choices I made in life./n<neg> I'm skeptical going long anything this week. Lots of earnings reports that could get ugly $MSFT $GOOGL $AAPL $AMZN $META (those alone make up 40% of $QQQ). Plus FOMC on Wednesday. Be cautious/n<neg> What does make me nervous for earnings is tech industries and strong USD. $AAPL has 2/3 of sales from outside US. Strong dollar will dramatically eat away at revenue for them, $MSFT, $GOOGL, $META, and other tech companies./n<neu> @SirBradford I agree! Yesterday I sat on my hands when I could‚Äôve played a put off the 396 rejection but the choppy mess of yesterday prevented me from taking it! Once $AAPL reports I think we‚Äôll get a clear direction/n<neu> Trial for 3 symbols only #ES $MSFT and $AAPL 

I usually trade YM and NQ, but will trade the ES and if I like it, I'll pay the 40/month for the full subscription/n<neu> @johnyboy1853 @MarketRebels If it tanks to $145, I'd be $240 under my cost basis (150 minus the 260 premium).  This is part of the risk - puts and calls are not risk free.  However, I would not be concerned as AAPL is solid and will get back up over $150 in short time.  I would just sell calls on it./n<neu> @jeremychrysler @MbeRoutledge @ylanmui @RonwHammond @SenToomey @SenatorSinema I paid for my last trip to the grocery store with one share of $AAPL/n<neu> @InfinityTradesX I‚Äôm long aapl googl / short arkk via puts/n<neu> @alexallwealth Mostly just DCA into index funds. I was able to pickup some $AAPL in the $130s and I‚Äôll probably pickup more if it comes back down. 

I have a few other stocks I‚Äôm looking at if they pull back, but nothing major. How about you?/n<pos> @FIREDUpWealth $MSFT, $AAPL, $LRCX among others. There will be lots to read and dig through. More than anything, I‚Äôm looking for management teams that are showing that they have understood these crazy conditions at least as well as their competitors. I will keep adding to the trust builders./n<pos> Really Solid ERs coming out so far this morning. I think across the board earning are far better than the market feared about a month ago.

#AMZN #AAPL #MSFT #ES_F #SPX/n<neu> If I had to make an education guess based purely on charts I‚Äôd say $SPY could see $389-$391 today. If $GOOGL  $MSFT $AAPL beat and guide well $416 if they don‚Äôt new 52 week lows $345/n<neg> @futureformerJD I can see it with $BRK.B. $AAPL seems a bit expensive to me, although I haven't done much work on it for years./n<neg> 3M says they see their smartphone business is weak. I don‚Äôt suppose this translates to $aapl. #qqq #spy/n<neu> @ProfitsTaken I see a lot of short interest in AAPL @ $152.50  08/05 contracts, thoughts?/n<neg> Surely market expectation went a bit lower into the big tech ER season but not sure if prices fully reflect that - $AAPL is just 15 % off ATHs w/ heavy P/E, that does not feel like enough imho. Currency headwinds, Chinese lockdowns, poor $T/$VZ churn, consumer sentiment not great/n<neu> @BackpackerFI I'd rank them exactly the same, but only if we're talking about current day. 

If we're ranking the 10-20 year outlook, then I'd do this:
1. $GOOG
2. $FB
3. $AMZN
4. $AAPL
5. $MSFT
6. $NFLX/n<neu> ... phone sales is Asia are up in the last 12 months but down in the last 6, so not sure about $AAPL. Might be a difficult week for #NQ_F, I imagine missed result but EPS above expectations (to keep P/E afloat). Overall: could dip down to 11900 but no new lows until September IMO/n<pos> Laughing at the CNBC guests already downplaying the AAPL earnings. "BUT IT'S A GREAT COMPANY SO YOU HAVE TO OWN IT!!!" 
Apple is a company growing at 6% a year that is trading at 25x earnings. Not what I'd call a "MUST OWN" company/n<neu> @wheeliedealer If you are business with a music streaming app, you've got to play by $GOOG and $AAPL rules or get off their platforms. I'd say that has a big influence. I thought they were supposed to be looking at this but did not say much about it in their press release. #SONG #RHM #7DIG/n<neg> Wednesday 1PM CT - Fed rate hike (interest rates)

I was anticipating a decline into DCL, but its had a robust move and curious where its headed short term./n<neu> @Phil_tered @jam_croissant $AAPL has been my go-to for call-side up until this past Friday when I posted that I was expecting a reversal off trend resistance. (As in, I was long $AAPL calls and short $SPY calls.)

Now we're at a trend resistance so I'm on the lookout for a new ticker to do the same w/ puts/n<pos> @ShoucairHassan @AndrewRedlawsk The best companies in the world economy. Big winners like $MSFT and $AAPL down to smaller important companies like $AXON. I have a wide range of companies I like and invest in. Then, the market picks my winners./n<neu> @MMCrypto Except for when I was doing my homework/n<neg> @BusinessFamous @TD_Investor Getting into $WMT instead of $AAPL in 1999 - and then of course, my $KODK moment follows. üòÖü§£ (I actually have too many ‚Äòbiggest‚Äô financial regrets haha)/n<neu> @TicTocTick I am short aapl.. easy money/n<neu> $T trying to tell you. $WMT trying to tell you.

I have such a bias against $V and $MA, but they are literally money making machines. I love $AAPL and $MSFT. Both top 19 holdings for me at this point./n<neu> Things I‚Äôm looking out for this #earnings week, with key reports from $GOOGL $MSFT $META $SHOP $AAPL:

- How bad is the state of online advertising?
- Will cloud spending hold up?
- What will be the outlook for e-commerce?
- What‚Äôs the demand like for PCs &amp; phones?/n<neu> @hammertrades18 @YouTube I am also watching BTC, hit a high of $24,400 and had 3 legs down over the Friday, Saturday and today and is at $21,000. Sooner or later I expect it to be reflected in the Nasdaq too. Also, not a lot of hope for AAPL (discounts in China are rare and so are hiring freezes)/n<neu> This week I‚Äôm buying nothing but puts.  Currently holding $GS $SQ $NFLX puts.  Will add $googl $aapl $bby $tgt/n<neu> Even after that Monster rally in $AAPL from $130 to over $155. in July. That's almost 20%. Think of all the Billions that were made? haha   
 I still think the market will have trouble into October which is about 3 months away.

Did I miss anything?/n<neg> @CL_fTrader dude this is exactly where i'm at, this entire rally has come before the 2 biggest names in consumer discretionary. Aapl and AMZN could tank this fucking - there are so many unknowns/n<neu> @NatGasGuy1 @crypto000101 @SpecuIator_ I think VIX may hold back a run to 430 just yet. AAPL forward guidance should be telling. The hiring freeze tells me they have margin pressure. Best way to increase/maintain profit margins is to cut labor costs. We shall see!/n<pos> @TraderChipmunk That said, we could be in a positive feedback loop, rallying on every small tick down in inflation indicators. 

If $AAPL and $AMZN take a dump post earnings, I‚Äôm going to be an aggressive buyer./n<pos> @SuperA001 Tbh i like the play a lot. $aapl weekly rising wedge and h&amp;s. $msft big reject at 270 level. Be confident, hope is not a strategy./n<neu> $AAPL EPS regression

Hi tardos,

based on EPS historical data of some companies ( $GOOG, $MSFT, $META) i have easily calculated a linear regression model for $AAPL EPS:/n<neu> @ProfitsTaken I was talking about the market.
SPY, QQQ, TSLA, AAPL, etc. - all of them were red on Monday and Tuesday. 
Only today they all had a üî•day/n<neu> I'll post my levels in the morning after GDP. The market will either gap up or down depending on the report.

$AAPL $TSLA $NVDA $QQQ $SPY/n<neg> @Buried_Value I think they are seeing very different data than $GOOG because the changes to $AAPL IOS hurt $META vastly more than $GOOG. Going to take a long time to get out from under $AAPL's thumb. Why they are investing so much into the metaverse so as to control the entire ecosystem./n<pos> @hughhewitt I don't know Mr. Hewitt.  I for one would really like to see a practical estimate of that $313B.  It would be very simple for someone to compute that number for say $AMZN, $GOOG, $MSFT, $META and $AAPL.  And it would be really interesting to then compare that to $XOM &amp; $CVX./n<pos> @DGretta_Author @WealthSquad They won't. If $google survived this earnings round, I think $amzn will too. Both, along with $aapl $tsla will be the beacon of hope in an otherwise dismal NASDAQ./n<neu> @LuoshengPeng GDP will determine.
I don‚Äôt think it will be negative again.
$AAPL and $AMZN might lead the way before earnings.
People regardless of a positive outcome of $AAPL might see a sell off Friday. 
That has happened before: pump dump./n<neu> @Braczyy @TrendSpider I've tried catching most of these recently and bit the dust on most of them.  SPY, AAPL, MSFT.  I'm guessing this breaks to the upside for now./n<neg> I‚Äôve been telling everyone around me, buy $AAPL stock‚Ä¶.because once they drop a vehicle I don‚Äôt care about recession talk, people are going to buy/lease what they can‚Äôt afford just so they can say ‚ÄúI got it first‚Äù ü§£üòÇ/n<neg> @OptionsAction @CNBCFastMoney @Michael_Khouw Junior Suit Guy, still waiting for $AAPL to go down to $100.  Calgon take me away/n<neu> $AAPL now trading at levels seen last December.  Oh my!  I hate to say this, but it's a high conviction short imo./n<neu> @TJ1STMILLION It doesn't matter if its sales went down or not. All that matters is the market's reaction. I'm just observing though. No position either way on $AAPL/n<neu> @TOzgokmen lol... you bring the beer and I'll bring the $AAPL and $TSLA/n<neg> @HedgeyeComm Nailed it- I would not be surprised if $aapl and $amzn miss, and rug this hopium tomorrow. That and a bad gdp print will end this bear market rally/n<neu> @blueshirt_plus @Jedi_ant i think both aapl and amzn earnings have to be picture perfect tomorrow fore that scenario to play out./n<neu> But whatever I hit em with $googl &amp; $aapl calls üí∞üí∞üí∞üî•üî•üòÇüï∫üèø/n<pos> alright, so this concludes the day for me. will go through $NOW transcript tomorrow and post interesting points if there's some. $AAPL tomorrow after close and that's it for the week.

good night ‚úåÔ∏è/n<neu> @GoldTAnalysis $uvxy did hold it‚Äôs trend line bounced back today, I‚Äôm personally looking to pick up some. But not trying to rush into a position will let gdp numbers unravel first. Depending on how markets perform tomorrow I may prior to close or after $aapl reports./n<neu> Didn‚Äôt take a trade today. Honestly think it was out of fear of forcing a trade just because it‚Äôs FOMC. I was still watching premiums and saw the $400 call go from 0.51 &gt; 2.00 so there was def money to be made but waiting to see what happens with GDP and $aapl earnings/n<pos> My DM's are open!

Lets keep making money together!

Should I sell my $AAPL and $TSLA long position (commons) for 33% gain and 87% gain respectively?/n<neg> $QCOM, $WMT, $T, $VZ, $TGT, $BBY $STX all said the consumer is stressed and spending on consumer electronics - including smartphones- is a bit difficult. That doesn't bode well for $AAPL. Is it in the stock? I have no position./n<neu> 2 more long months, I mean days of trading left. 
Recap: 
- $MSFT, $GOOG, $GOOGL, $META missed.
- FED WILL continue to raise rates data dependent, but durable goods report + and GDP expected to be + tomorrow. Do you call that weakening in data‚ùì

I don't think they are disastrous, but they have a lot of things to figure out. $AAPL really put the squeeze on the company. Lot of headwinds for $META to fight against./n<neg> @unusual_whales well that's bullish -- Except I'm never buying an $AAPL car... to worried I'll have to replace/upgrade it in 3yrs.

This could just be a 1 day reaction./n<neu> @cpmoss35 @MissionWinners I will take trades like this with earnings the next day only because the report is after the close. Gives me the day to decide/act.  (I'm in AAPL as of today at the trigger)/n<neu> @RockyBTrades tbh I'm surprised that in the best case scenario bulls aren't going harder. Still some hesitancy for the GDP print and $AAPL earnings üëÄ/n<neu> @jeff_stalvey I agree.

Lot of factors haven‚Äôt changed.
- Feds balance sheet run off
- Inflation
- Supply chain
- Housing market
- Job Market (AAPL Tesla MSFT all not hiring; big techs know what‚Äôs coming) 

New lows will come!!/n<neu> Trade Recap for 07/27/2022:
1.) $AAPL: 150p | 1.65 ---&gt; 1.82 | +10.30% ‚úÖ

My third trade was a toss up. Hence why I did so far out of the money. Gotta just stick to the A+ and avoid dumb trades/n<neu> @BenBSP I ended up jumping in on $aapl calls for the pop/n<neu> This was quite hawkish (and may I add a downcast Powell) FED 

The only theory I have is what he said is because he knows $AAPL and $META results/n<pos> @AJButton2 It‚Äôs mind blowing.

I really think aapl will be terrible and it has not come down at all./n<neu> First out// $AAPL: Top Wall Street Bets Mentions for Wednesday July 26, 2022 Since 9:30 AM ET Open: GME, TSLA, MSFT, META, AAPL, GOOG, SHOP, UVXY, NVDA,/n<neu> @Crussian17 I agree.

NQ blowing its load right now.  I think AAPL doesnt get out of this downturn unscathed.  just no chance./n<neu> I wouldnt chase this bullish day down. Fed still needs to hike rates. $AAPL hasnt reported. $META reports tonights. There could be some bearish catalysts/n<neu> @drylandbovine @PelosiTracker_ I think the bigger play is ASML, not Nvidia. They make equipment to make these chips for TSMC, INTC, Samsung, and even AAPL. TSMC is the top dog right now./n<pos> @antiprosynth I know many assets with that property - $TSLA, $AAPL, $AMZN

August often a weak month followed by weaker seasonal flows in Sept Oct and $VIX starting to make higher lows so option prices should go ‚¨ÜÔ∏è from here./n<neu> Heavy in $TSLA and $AAPL shares.

With upcoming fomc I expect a move upside then quick Tank to the downside to complete this market bottom.

Not many (if any) would/could have seen $AAPL achieving a $3T MC back in 2003. From &lt;$.23 to $182 (split adj.) Took 20 years, but anyone I know would have dumped every avail $$ into it in hindsight./n<pos> @ProfitsTaken This was such a beautiful play.  The way it pulled back into yesterdays highs and pumped was as good as it gets.  Loved $AAPL and $QQQ this AM./n<neu> Shutting down my desktops after taking a few $$$ I can early this A.M. $TYDE $NCMI $ALVR $RELI.  No $MSFT $AAPL $META $GOOGL or these highly-priced stocks this morning./n<neu> $AAPL earnings fast approaching, some may be alluding to the fact that since $MSFT rallied Apple will too. I understand the reasoning, but both are completely different companies

MSFT does it‚Äôs business with other businesses. AAPL does business with consumers‚Ä¶/n<neg> @TicTocTick I still lost 2.5k this AM.  Got trapped in AAPL shorts ü©≥/n<neu> I've already made enough money on both of the big $AAPL rallies. I have pretty high conviction these rallies keep going, but the money is in the bank and I don't want to push my edge too far. The violent move has already been made./n<neu> @AlbertBridgeCap @jimmy_3110 If you have this same poll on Twitter about almost any popular stock (AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, etc) I wonder if you‚Äôd be a similar result tho/n<neu> @endless_frank Nah.

I have all the $SPY 0DTE calls and $AAPL weekly calls./n<neu> SPX should pump above 4k after some quick fear this week but after a nice move up, we'll come down very hard. I'd be patient for long-term buys; they'll go lower than you think. #ES_F #SPY #QQQ #AAPL #TSLA/n<neu> Note:
The only trade I took today was on $AAPL calls, which actually drew down the most, but was my top watch (and all I was watching as I was busy/distracted)

For now, I'm continuing this simple charting strategy and observing how I perform using it.

Here's the gist of it.../n<neu> Market rippee this morning. $AAPL led the charge. $TSLA followed. $ENPH sweet dip buy off 230 now 250. I want to watch for a small fade./n<pos> @Jayteecee347 Good input. This reminds me of when Buffett initially saw his grandchild using an iPhone, and observed how attached they were‚Ä¶this was right before his first stake in $AAPL/n<neg> @ProfitsTaken AAPL TRADE üíØüéØüî• You're the GOAT.

I'm also long $V and $NKE./n<pos> $NVDA $AAPL $AMD $SOXL and added to $ENPH solid ideas from yesterday. i have positions in all. stops in place keeping things tight with meeting today./n<pos> Top of the list for me, for most valuable global platforms include:

Good to expect a lot of volatility. Trade safe! 
 
I shall be back on Friday.  
Good Luck folks!/n<neu> I remember a time when the community would bond together and pump a stock, it was great. We need that back. Screw fundamentals, you think Wall Street cares?? We‚Äôre literally in a recession but $AAPL up 10% this month lmao make it make sense. $SPY $MSFT/n<neu> Zuck on Apple‚Äôs role in the Metaverse:

‚ÄúApple is going to be a competitor. I think that that's pretty clear, but it's actually a very deep competitor. It's a philosophical competition about what direction the internet should go in.‚Äù

$TSLA $GOOGL $MSFT now and maybe $AAPL $AMZN too

I can smell something... BADü´£ü´£/n<neu> Don‚Äôt short without a hedge. It‚Äôs still early. 

Or if you‚Äôre that crazy to short without a hedge, at least wait for $AAPL and $AMZN to report which will initially rally regardless of good or bad earnings. 

I would wait a couple of days for them to pump and then short./n<neu> Going into the week I was looking for one more rally, mainly fueled by what we saw last night, I was looking for the big push past 4016 into the huge demand zone near 4095

Unless something drastic happens today, and unless we get a surprise beat by $AAPL (unlikely) market is/n<neu> Have to be honest, the $SPOT numbers this morning make me much less bearish on $AAPL into earnings tomorrow ./n<neg> @RJRCapital Your thinking on this seems backwards. Yes, they did miss but the market had already assumed much worse which is why the stock are up.

Why would you expect META AAPL or AMZN to be any different? (AMZN being the least interesting of the three to me)/n<pos> @DivesTech By the way I loved your $MSFT PT cuts from $340 to $320 as they missed on lots of metrics üòç

I hope you won't think twice doing the same for $AAPL if they misses the metrics üôè/n<neu> @AstroCycle_Net good call yesterday Francis..
SPX didn't hit 3900 like i wanted, i guess i was bit too greedy.  Today mkt will open around 3950s, i was wondering how did you come up with 4096 as target?

both MSFT and GOOG rallied today on bad earnings, so i guess same for AAPL and AMZN on fri./n<neg> @RJRCapital ‚ÄúIf you must play these‚Äù‚Ä¶ are you suggesting that December puts on AAPL are a bad idea? That‚Äôs what I own btw./n<neu> AAPL: Forrest Gump :: INFY: Lal Singh Chadha?

If $SNAP got smoked by $AAPL Privacy policies, $META will too/n<neu> @JonBryant421 I don‚Äôt know, and it probably doesn‚Äôt matter. My point is that I‚Äôm surprised that WEB like $OXY‚Äôs business more than $MSFT‚Äôs one, esp because he liked AAPL a long time ago./n<neu> @CNBCJulianna @JonLemire Cash options#. A couple hundred million in investments with this market. 10 percent MSFT 5 percent AAPL like 30 percent technology alt energy. The rest I‚Äôll trade.

A big move is coming, either direction, probably later this week.

The thing that makes me doubt the upside is AAPL. It just got to 156, a ridiculous spot, on 22 July. A resumption right back would look very strange, but all is possible./n<pos> I think it's funny they're trying to change the definition of a recession and say we aren't in one or headed in that direction, inevitably. Thursday and Friday should be interesting plus rate hikes. $SPY $AAPL $MSFT/n<neg> If $MSFT and $GOOG/L missed, I'm not holding my breath on $AAPL./n<neu> $AAPL

I predict, as the last of the big tech companies to report, Apple‚Äôs earnings will trigger the next sell off. Shake out the rest of the weak hands, and I expect a major sell off on Friday. Things to watch: $DXY, $VIX, and $TLT.

PS: $HYG, $ETH, and $BTC all made highs./n<neg> @leedom_tyler @DivesTech Amazon should go up tomorrow. $AMZN and $AAPL are far from growth stocks nowadays as they both grow about 30% slower than an average S&amp;P-listed company but trade in steep multiples, still.

I bought AAPL ü§£/n<neg> @chicagosean Yeah that smarts. I saw that üò±I‚Äôm still scratching my head why $AAPL is going up?  In after hours.  So underwhelming their beat was like üòë MEH.  As an investor they‚Äôre not doing much more than they did to innovate.  There‚Äôs better elsewhere./n<pos> @Larry_F1sh @_TheBeef_ @cdntradegrljenn @vnkumarvnk Its ongoing for quite some time. I wish they takeover $QCOM and be as strong as $AAPL/n<neu> @Middlesexkid @Borg74 @OphirGottlieb @jfahmy I tell people this all the time and people always wanna argue. You buy $AAPL and you hold it for life. dont ever sell it./n<pos> @borismacek @mhoncho555 @WifeyAlpha I am in cash and had been waiting for $AAPL and $AMZN to tell me if this was a bear market rally or if the bottom was in. They both had strong earnings and guidance. Market is rallying strong. With strong earnings and guidance from most of the leaders how is the bottom not in?/n<pos> alright, that's it from me for today. looking forward to go deeper into $AAPL transcript and $TTD's changes. 

good night ü•±‚úåÔ∏è/n<pos> AAPL/ AMZN: Big earnings report tonight tells us that we se going to have a soft landing as I suspect the 4th quarter will be positive!/n<neg> @StrizziJ AFAIK I tell everyone aapl was crashing and $100 and then don‚Äôt tweet after it bangs üòÇ/n<neu> @Mr_Derivatives I will not short, but might just sell some QQQ longs at open and re-evaluate later, I want to see how the market reacts to AMZN and AAPL during market hours./n<neu> @CharlieeMMartin Yeah $AAPL &amp; $AMZN surprised me. But you can‚Äôt win em all./n<neu> @CaseyHansen1989 @mikepsilva I thought it was 68/32, whichever. QQQ looks like it might close within (before AMZN and AAPL ERs came out), but SPY hoh hoh hoh./n<pos> Ok $AMZN and $AAPL should do wonders for the market. We have most of the 'announcements' behind us and seem to be holding. I don't think PCE tells us anything we don't already know. In fact the way gov was pushing it might even be good news so..../n<pos> @PranavRawal23 I mentioned them because its a like for like comparison between competitors $AAPL and $GOOGL. 

All three have cash cows looking for their 3rd/4th act with voice assistant being a small piece of the pie currently. 

Its good enough to raise questions about Google‚Äôs durability./n<pos> another exit 162.97   AAPL    now i am safe  from a sell down/n<neu> @JerrBearr I suspect they will. Soon enough. While I love $AAPL, I do think they will see a slowdown and the next quarter might not be so forgiving./n<neg> @alec_zamora I'm skeptical. Accuse me of wearing a tinfoil hat all you want. lol

What are the chances we get -GDP right after the WH twists the definition of recession AND AAPL beats?

Stranger than fiction./n<neg> @howardlindzon Um, just for the record I am not excited about @aapl and @amzn numbers.

I would not wish to mislead anyone about this. Who knows what they would do./n<pos> @jimcramer I do Mr Cramer. Proud iPhone and iPad owner here. Thinking about getting a watch with those AAPL gains I made because of you among others ! Go FANGS !/n<pos> @RaquelQuaglia AM sell off after a push yesterday with flat FOMC. 
The "inflation act" provided optimism and a catalyst for the move up.

Big move up after hours on the heels of $AAPL and $AMZN delivering strong earnings. These are market mover mega caps./n<neu> @Tricky_OW AAPL back in the multi year trend. That's what I've got my eye on. ~159.5 pivot point methinks. 
Would like to see pullback to retest it with strong reaction and we may just be in sit on your hands szn.
Just my thoughts, still relatively new at this./n<neu> @JohnDoss1 i was being half facetious but also noting this move pulls aapl back over the 250DMA./n<neu> @kimmasters The Financial Statement Analysis class I‚Äôm currently taking uses $AAPL for a lot of examples and they have mountains of cash. Gotta spend it on something eventually, right?/n<pos> When considering $AAPL's strong quarter, it is clear people want their high quality brands. I own an iPhone, IWatch, an iPad, &amp; a MiniMac./n<neg> @BigBullCap I don‚Äôt trust these huge rallies for a slim beat on $AAPL or $AMZN. It fits description of bear market rallies. Discretionary spending is under huge pressure going forward. Late comers to the short party getting squeezed out./n<pos> @WEquilCapital :) there are two product makers that absolutely kill it.
1. $AAPL 
2. $TSLA

I won't bet against them./n<neu> @danieljmardorf I think $AAPL gets pegged tomorrow/n<pos> installment plans and trade in programs is how Apple wants to improve affordability says Maestri - I agree that residual value on Apple products is high but generally you trade $ with peace of mind going through Apple rather than other channels #AAPL/n<neu> There's Apple Fanboys and then there's $AAPL Fanboys. I'm in the latter./n<neu> @Rand0mNPC @28delayslater @defnotES2 Of tommorow $aapl closes green I would have won this bet and he would owe me pizza/n<neu> $AMZN lol so they hit estimates and guidance on par - hmmm I‚Äôll personally be selling all positions I‚Äôm up in seems like a big ole bait $SPY $QQQ $AAPL $GOOGL 

The anti of what was happening when companies beat but were down 20%/n<neg> @unusual_whales I see lots of doomers saying the sky is falling in these comments but I see so many companies still hiring like crazy, AAPL still selling $82B worth of shit this Q and AMZN $121B. Lots of people are still spending a lot and doing fine. Crash is coming but it aint here yet guys./n<neu> Tim Cook asked about M&amp;A on $AAPL Earnings Call: 

"We would buy something that is strategic for us. We never buy to just buy. To date, we've been focused on IP and people acquisitions. I wouldn‚Äôt rule anything out. We're constantly observing the market."/n<pos> @WamsiM I got an idea, cut AAPL price target. You must be a genius/n<neu> With $AMZN $MSFT $GOOGL $AAPL beating, I think $'s will continue to flow out of $META. Think this continues to get sold or at very lease underperforms/n<neg> @deltagammaqueen I have spy $424 
I saw the same this morning 
Biggest confusion for me is how far ahead $aapl has been compared to the market/n<neg> @rsosa8 @ADHD_Capital Late for quarterly call 

AMZN: Sorry we are experiencing server issues 

MSFT: Sorry I was rebooting my cpu 

AAPL: Sorry my AirPods wouldn‚Äôt connect

TSLA: Sorry I was showing our new intern Barbara the Happy Baby yoga position and how it really opens up her hips/n<neu> on possible acquisitions "we always look" says @tim_cook - just like me when I go shopping and don't need anything #justsaying #AAPL/n<neu> EARNINGS CALL: $AAPL CEO Tim Cook on acquisitions: 

"I wouldn't rule anything out for the future"/n<pos> Sorry had a conference called.

i took my nap lol/n<neu> $AAPL $AMZN Alright beats on earnings. But not enough for big AH positive. ‚ÄúBetter than feared‚Äù trades will get old pretty soon. I am neither a bear nor a bull. Just looking at the facts./n<pos> @orionstafa before bought them... I looked at $AAPL &amp; $AMZN earnings, they were UP after earnings announcing. Yesterday $META &amp; b4 that $GOOG &amp; $MSFT. I think these tech companies have big impact for the market. $APPL, $MSFT &amp; $GOOG are using $Intel products. I connect the dots b4 buying./n<neu> @BullandBaird An AAPL a day keeps the.........
Well......
Poverty away, I guess
üòÉ/n<neu> now i want to short  AMZN AAPL/n<neu> @DeSean_is_the_1 Nobody can tell you that you are wrong or right when it comes to this. But I don‚Äôt think you should look at investing that way. 10k invested in $AAPL 10 years ago is $60,113 today. 10k invested plus $500 every month is $272,417 today./n<neu> Here come the profit takers. Guess I was right but just pulled the trigger a little early. $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL popped n took me out 163.8 order n now 161.74  wow  lmao/n<neu> @StonkMessiah I went 21 days out on both my bearish $AAPL and $AMZN earnings trade.  Still have time to be right./n<pos> iPhone saw strong double digit switcher numbers for the quarter says Maestri  - I so would like to see the regional breakdown of these numbers as I would argue it is tightly linked to the consolidation on the Android camp #AAPL/n<neu> I spoke too soon before AAPL reported earnings.  We will hit before September/n<neg> @SilbergleitJr Your a joke. Name me another tech company that can report even 19.44b in quarter2 which typically is the worst quarter for #AAPL due to anticipated new models in September. Don‚Äôt trash the most valuable company in the word/n<neg> @TicTocTick I been fckd this week. Not your greatest week, Tic. Shame I decided to hold shorts. Aapl ripped too. üòû/n<neu> $AAPL &amp; $AMZN I like booking profits into strength. Be careful if $QQQ shows weakness as a leading indicator./n<pos> "We prevented nearly $1.5 billion in fraudulent transactions by stopping over 1.6 million risky and vulnerable apps and app updates" says @tim_cook - I do not remember Apple sharing a number like this before seems a good &amp; timely way to show the value of the app store #AAPL/n<neg> @RyanMiller_TE @Limedonk @kaylatausche Well I suppose one can proclaim we are in a recession, if you're a technocrat economist at Yale crunching numbers. But in the reality of Main Street, there is no recession. 

Walmart says poor people are hurting (from inflation). AAPL/AMZN says everybody else has money to spend./n<pos> $TSLA $GOOGL $AAPL $MSFT all proven to me this earnings season why they make up what I consider core allocation in my portfolio. 

Onwards and upward we go!/n<neu> I‚Äôd exit Longs on $aapl $amzn earnings. Watching dark pools tomorrow/n<neu> $AAPL just gapped up through the 200 DMA. See if it holds in the AM. Long $FNKO $TSLA $PRVA $HRMY $CELH $HALO $META $WWE $DVN $OXY $FLNG $LNG  $RGEN $SGEN $AMZN/n<neg> @WatcherGuru I dont own enough AAPL/n<pos> If $AAPL makes new highs its taking $SPY with it right?/n<neg> @stuart_rat89 What was your AAPL target? I bought it before the close and put it a sell at $163. They had a small beat but I guess the market was expecting worse./n<neu> I think it ends like this. #NDX trading over its 100 day a/h.  $AAPL was one and only trading over 100 day prior to today.  In tough mkts big companies lead. Also when owning stks becomes fashionable again they buy the stks that do well in earnings.  Interest rates well off highs/n<neu> @GuyAdami Let me guess you got the $AAPL earnings wrong again!:) I know I know nobody is perfect, but you were confident for weeks with that one :)/n<neu> I wonder if part of this is just end of month propping $AMZN $AAPL/n<neu> I‚Äôve seen a lot of people complaining about $btc and $alts correlation to the $NDX, but it presents opportunities. 

You just had more than a few minutes to buy after $amzn and $aapl prints before crypto reacted. That‚Äôs an eternity in trading/n<neu> @madaznfootballr Sorry for the L. I was tempted to short $AMZN but glad I didn't. I shorted $AAPL but didn't realize the earnings came out. Had an open limit order and luckily got filled everything except 1 share. Which I took a quick loss on. Why did you short $AMZN? Were there resistance?/n<neu> does it feel a bit frothy or am I just a contrarian? $SPY $QQQ $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL BOOM! Looks like I was wrong!! Learning lesson: don‚Äôt fight the trend

But will hold a few more days to see what the outcome is, didn‚Äôt spend too much capital so flexible SL/n<neu> @WifeyAlpha I bought one share of aapl at the close. I keep refreshing MarketWatch lookin for the headline of my trade./n<pos> Whenever I feel like shorting $AAPL (I have never done it and I own a small stake) I remind myself of their earnings reports and calls. Big respect, from a financial perspective./n<neg> @STXRBOY999 Bro I only did aapl puts I'm broke I need moneyüò≠/n<neu> $AAPL and $AMZN - I‚Äôve owned both since 2016 and every year I end up asking myself why I don‚Äôt own more./n<pos> $AMZN C‚Äôs may cover all losses barely or we may be red by a little! $AAPL rallieddddd but tomorrow I‚Äôm playing $SPX / $SPY at open! Gonna be a banger LFG/n<pos> @Pharmdca Always worth having a position in $AAPL ‚Ä¶ much better and safer than XYZ shit biotech that I own/n<neu> My only swing is $LYFT and that's from unusual options flow..that's it..I wish I could say I'll be rich off of $AMZN and $AAPL calls and $ROKU puts, but I don't and I won't hold through ERs../n<pos> Just love to see $AAPL, $AMZN, and $TSLA up. All great earnings, all exceptional American companies. Invest in great American companies and I promise over the long run you will excel./n<neg> I will never understand how aapl turnsover 50bn a quarter worth of stuff we dont really need. prob more a reflection on society than anything else. mind boggling./n<neu> @AlertsTtbb Well whales were wrong on amazn and aapl. Haha glad I only took a beer money sized put./n<neg> I was wrong on $AAPL. Impressive double beat. 

This is why I never play earnings ü§ù/n<pos> $AAPL and $AMZN both up nicely after hours. Earnings better then expected. Thank god I still have some Apple calls. They should print tomorrow./n<neg> @JPATrades I'll never buy AAPL puts, god damn what a company/n<neu> @howardlindzon It does look like we will have only 5 companies left soon $aapl $msft $googl $amzn $tsla not sure how big they are in the index but I imagine 30%
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ/n<neu> i must look at $aapl action always.
it‚Äôs simply whole markets.

since i started trading
i looked at $aapl chart roughly 5 times. i tell the truth 

wow/n<pos> I think it's pretty much safe to say that Americans don't mind to drown in CC debt but gotta have that $1K new iphone every / every other year 
$AAPL/n<neg> They‚Äôll keep running up $SPY on low volume. $AAPL &amp; $AMZN will be a further catalyst for that. Economically, nothing good is happening‚Ä¶ I see low volume algo driven price action during a time where data points toward an economy in recession.  Hmm I wonder what will happen ü§î/n<pos> Fintwit furus who reiterated their bearish bias last week somehow bought AMZN and AAPL calls. üòÇ 

I use to pay attention to all the noise and follower count. Now I‚Äôm just thankful to be trading with a close group of online homies./n<pos> @maxjanderson And yet we continue upwards üìà
AMZN + AAPL earnings propping it up further AH. Likely to continue into tomorrow if I had to guess./n<neg> I would never sell a single $AAPL stock until they‚Äôve launched a 3D interface phone or a time travel app and the world hated it./n<neg> $aapl impressive but looking ex-growth at this point or nearly ex-growth.

$amzn - that was trash earnings of the highest order.  

Apple rally i get but Amazon to pre-split $2750?  get your shit together lol/n<pos> @liathetrader @Apple Thanks to AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and GOOGL this week.  Hoping ABBV tomorrow AM will not let me down./n<pos> @MTradess I agree with you 100%. I wonder if $AAPL and $AMZN hold $SPY and $QQQ up tomorrow. I love my this job. I am already excited for Friday and next week. I will try to have no bias in my trading tho./n<neu> In terms of rev geos, the only one of five with significant weakness (Greater China was essentially flat YOY, not bad at all considering the recent waves of lockdowns) is Japan, down about 15% YOY. I wonder if mgmt says anything about it, though unlikely a long-term issue. $AAPL/n<pos> Bought $amzn and $aapl in 2016. They have not let me down.  Invest in great companies and let it ride./n<pos> Revenue $82.96 billion, expected $82.81 billion. 
Close call! No wonder $AAPL is venturing to new fields
I‚Äôm long $AAPL/n<neg> @smileycapital I'm confused at this point, is bad news (gdp) good news, and good news (aapl, amzn) also good news? seems boolish i guess/n<neu> @MFHoz As $AMZN rips up 12% AH and $AAPL up a cool 3%. I agree with most of your takes but timing the downtrend that exactly with this price action is silly/n<pos> I'm probably not listening to the earnings CC live today, but I'll be listening for Apple's comments on Mac revs (down just over 10% YOY) and W/H/A (down about 8% YOY, AirPods Pro being really old may factor in a bit). $AAPL/n<neg> $AAPL I don't see why people so excited.  2% growth maybe overall, they cutting spending a bunch of things don't add up.  These things can take a few days to come to reality, sometimes very next day.  Anyways I generally always critical of earnings, a true skeptic./n<neu> $aapl n $Amzn paying me tomorrow on my birthday üí∞/n<neu> I guess we‚Äôre not in a recession? $AAPL $AMZN beat estimates?/n<pos> @OTMCallOptions Well I anticipated good reports from amzn and aapl, so I put everything into those two, which went well. Thinking about moving over to exxon and chevron before tomorrow's reports/n<neg> @VSoien Market can‚Äôt go lower any more. $TSLA $MSFT $NFLX $AAPL $AMZN all rocket after earnings. I‚Äôve never seen them all beat and go up that much the next day./n<pos> $spy $qqq $iwm $aapl.  I was wrong.  Everything is perfect again and now FOMO reigns supreme.  Bears destroyed from the euphoria./n<pos> $AAPL $AMZN Apple in the Amazon makes a recession gone!/n<pos> A fine quarter from $AAPL, all things considered. 

I'm somewhat amused the stock's up a couple percent despite Apple's drop in net income YOY (the majority of which is driven by an apparent increase in tax rate YOY, given -10.6% net inc vs. -4.4% op inc. (GM was up a bit YOY.)/n<neu> @BullTradeFinder Bought a lotto $SPY put into the close, but seems to work out not so well‚Ä¶. Earnings of $AMZN and $AAPL much stronger than I expected!/n<neg> I'm not impressed with AAPL earnings.  EPS shrunk on a YoY basis. Revenues up 2% YoY with inflation up 9% YoY.  AAPL stock is badly overvalued.  This is a no-growth stock with hyper-growth valuation multiples./n<neu> @jimcramer Pls don‚Äôt turn into an $AAPL bull.   I own it./n<pos> I expected a slowdown from $AAPL, but they are still firing on all cylinders. 

Consumers are still spending given the macro conditions. Impressive./n<pos> I better wake up with an extra 6 racks tomorrow‚Ä¶ $AAPL $AMZN $AMD/n<pos> AMZN and AAPL earnings both very solid. The icing on the cake for what's been a strongly positive week for risk assets. There is more eco data tmrw AM but this rally should follow through setting the stage for what will be an interesting weekend session for crypto./n<pos> @HedgedFunds @SullyCNBC @GuyAdami I agree with your first two statements.  Will hold off on the third for a while.  (But yes, very solid reports from both $AAPL and $AMZN today)/n<neu> @Biohazard3737 Always been that way, #1 &amp; #2 are frugal industrial engineers. If I am not mistaken their biggest acquisition was $4 Bil Beats. $AAPL/n<neg> everyone excited about $aapl and $amzn numbers ‚Ä¶ of course me too because I own them but this recession and economy only makes them stronger and more evil as law of large numbers dictates. 

makes it tougher for everyone else./n<neu> My WHOLE feed is about @Apple #ER #Earnings and then I scroll down to read some other things and then an $AAPL ad is there ü•¥ü§£. I guess we all know what üçé is going to do tomorrow üëÄüìàü§îüìâ/n<neg> @VetTechTrader Why people are pushing this stock higher after $AAPL net income declined 10% is beyond me.  Earnings are declining and investors want to pay more than 25x for this company?/n<pos> Got a $SPY 410 C for tomorrow right after the market closed once I saw $AMZN earnings. Could setup for a nice play tomorrow. $AAPL just announced and flying AH too. FYI, you candy trade $SPY options up to 15 mins after the bell./n<neu> @I_Am_The_ICT Not that I would be trading after close personally, but displacement move sparked by AMZN left FVG, engineered some sellside just above it and then on AAPL announcement, swept it and took off. Beautiful‚Ä¶/n<pos> Good results for AMZN and AAPL so bad news for me. Fine. This bear market rally will maybe last a bit longer, I don't mind. Gonna extand short orders higher. If we don't nuke tomorrow then the weekend./n<neu> Did the "Fed pivot" narrative just take a hit with an AAPL beat?

All these earnings are telling me is the high end consumer hasn't been hit that hard by inflation yet. Low end has. Talk on social media verifies this. Subway sandwiches as high as artisan delis these days./n<pos> $AAPL says q4 rev growth rate to accelerate from 2% in q3- street at 8% so doesn't say a ton but the way I think they like it.../n<pos> If anyone deserves to be up 10%+ it is $AAPL. That is a high quality report considering how all of the rest of the tech is doing. $AAPL $MSFT and $GOOG have been the only tech earnings reports I was impressed by. All decently valued IMO./n<neg> I'd be cautious chasing $AAPL on this report. Just my opinion./n<neg> @squawksquare I don't get it either. I mean, they are not growing really in the end so I don't get it. Of course: Margins, cash etc is brutal. But there will be times when AAPL will trade at 15/20 PE again with flat iphone growth

btw. long since 2013/n<neg> $amzn came through

$intc bad apple

$aapl good numbers but stocks is overrated at current level vs rest of the market

Market remains very strong. $MSFT broke out today.. $SMH woke up, $INTC hitting it though...

$AMZN $AAPL good reports, see what they say on the calls!

See you in the am!/n<neg> $AAPL literally sand blasted shorts in the booty hole. I didn‚Äôt expect those numbers. Crazy./n<neg> @ImAPersonToo_17 @EthanFinancial Yes, insane.. market is at 408-409 now after $aapl earnings. Think we see 415 tomorrow imo. I closed all puts with slight profit. Can‚Äôt hold anything past 24 hours seems like. Nothing making sense./n<neg> Earnings are out $AAPL and $AMZN You know what I‚Äôm just gonna go on mute/n<neg> @Sneedchain Ye looks good tbh

I flipped between amzn aapl and intc for my first trade and I 100% picked the wrong one and I'm upset but wcyd/n<neg> I thought $aapl $amzn $googl and $Msft were all going bankrupt because $snap can‚Äôt sell ads, what happened?? Is it possible $snap is not the benchmark stock everyone thinks it is????/n<neg> @Mr_Derivatives These markets man.....they are sooooooo manipulated it's crazy.   I mean $gdx barely moved and gold is up almost 2%.  $amzn and $aapl got their price targets cut and they go nuts...it honestly is COMPLETELY broken./n<pos> I love big tech Earnings &amp; FOMC days

Every single announcement is comparable to being next to you‚Äôre  degenerate best friend. Every bet is the difference between paying rent or not.

With no disappointment from $AAPL &amp; $AMZN, we may see $890 area as upcoming area of consolidation. We might see that area attacked tomorrow.

EPS: $1.20 vs. $1.16 expected, 
Revenue: $82.96 billion vs. $82.81 billion

I‚Äôm waiting for AAPL in anticipation of tomorrow‚Äôs market action../n<pos> I still think Amazon should actually outperform in a mild recession, especially one centered on high energy prices where shopping from home and utilizing Prime Video and other services wins.

Ô£ø $AAPL ON-DECK./n<neu> @CryptoMichNL 2 different companies at the end of the day though, $AMZN is just massive while $AAPL, being the best run company in the world might do well but I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôll be a huge earnings report like $AMZN./n<neu> The Fed I mean $aapl 3 minutes til show time/n<neg> Keep in mind that $AAPL is affected more by bad macro high inflation than stocks like $GOOG. 
I think a paradigm shift may change after this ER season, in which stocks like $TSLA + $AAPL start to underperform/n<neg> $AAPL I‚Äôm thinking Q3 will be its downfall.

FYI $AAPL has a gap to fill ~$175 üòÇ have to imagine there is absolutely no chance that fills after hours but then again $AMZN just made a similar 10+% move so what the hell do i know. sure hope no one was shorting anything today/n<pos> Waiting for $AAPL earnings and then I take a nap. If $AAPL hits it out of the park the NASDAQ will go nuts/n<neg> @Dynamicbrands $AAPL screwed ads with the privacy changes. FB ads used to introduce things I never knew I wanted. Love $AMZN but the ads don‚Äôt accomplish that/n<pos> @PracKapital @pdosullivan Which doesn‚Äôt surprise me in the slightest- they weren‚Äôt disciplined with expansion- any company with AWS is going to learn incredibly quickly and replicate.

All the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù think recessions are bad.

Bought TQQQ premarket when it dipped below 30. Added when it went green. Trimmed when position hit 5%. Sold rest at close up 5.5% -- AAPL AMZN reports too closely tied to Qs to feel any cushion. Trade up 5%, book up 1.2%.

You ripped me, now rip the earnings/n<pos> That was a good night trade. Unloaded a bunch of $amzn shares for a 10% gain after hours. 

Bought two spy puts near the close I will be down on. Jammed 500 shares of Amazon in and out same with $aapl  selling some chunks before aapl releases/n<pos> More pain for bears ..as the rally continues to extend.   $amzn had a great beat and even indicated a better guidance than street wanted.   

$aapl will nail the coffin tomorrow for a rally that can extend towards 4300s and I definitely paid the price today./n<neg> @CryptoMichNL AAPL I think will not meet expectations. Prb means crap anyway. Market will pump, just the way it is./n<neg> I'm going to complain about the arrogance of $AAPL again for making us wait for its eps report./n<neu> @anyatrades $AAPL has had a pretty big run off the lows so I think it sells off../n<neu> @rocketmichaels @TrollGizmo @CNBCnow $NVDA $AMD $AAPL $QCOM taking over the space

These were up after alert, and I scaled out a tad.

i don‚Äôt bet ok :p/n<neu> @87AlwaysRed I can see $AAPL beating and $AMZN missing - the question is by how much maybe? - we'll know soon/n<neu> I bought an $aapl put. Just one. I had to participate lol

$135 Sep 16 PUT/n<pos> I have no idea what will happen with $AMZN or $AAPL and thats ok. GL/n<pos> $AAPL $AMZN send it!!! üöÄ I reckon both will have good earnings else ‚ò†Ô∏è tomorrow for the market/n<neg> @LiebermanAustin I think their is a bit too much optimism around both names for me. Especially $AAPL 

Their growth isn‚Äôt keeping up with the multiples at this point/n<pos> This market is starting to feel like a basketball being held underwater. Positive news out of $AMZN and $AAPL tonight could really get things going./n<neu> Let me explain #wallstreet $MSFT $GOOG $WMT $AAPL $FB ($META) and $AMZN all miss earnings, the @federalreserve just hiked rates by .75% and it about to increase QT from 45B to 90B a month. Markets rally 10% in 3 days. If I told you this in 2019. I would be locked up. #EndTheFed/n<neu> $AAPL : I bought some puts to hedge against my position/n<pos> Always excited for $AAPL earnings. 

Not sure why‚Ä¶ the company just keeps doing more of the same and I won‚Äôt be selling. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I‚Äôm sure $AMZN will have some fireworks though. 

Good luck out there!! üçÄ/n<neu> This has the feel of a blow-off day,  - $SPY rallied to that resistance point,  but we'll see what happens with $AAPL/n<neu> I think they dump this down to 4040 or so with AAPL earnings and then rally it back on the call./n<neu> $aapl now $157.13
will see $163 on earnings today 

don‚Äôt play with fire i advise ‚Ä¶./n<neu> I already know $AMZN or $AAPL gonna bend me over.

That‚Äôs now a surprise I am looking for/n<neu> They running this up to make us forget aapl has earnings? SPY crushing. Took some sqqq overnight ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I could be wrong but it‚Äôs the better r/r play and I want a piece of the action/n<neg> @ScottWapnerCNBC @CNBCOvertime Expect $ROKU $INTC to disappoint &amp; $AAPL $AMZN to meet but flatline until earnings call then react to guidance ‚Äì these are my guesses but then your panelists are afraid to predict in these volatile times, so I'm putting my two cents in since I don't have a reputation to defend üòÇ/n<neg> Adding to my hedges up here on es and nq. Amzn and aapl earnings likely to be horrid and guide lower. I don‚Äôt see how consumer demand can remain high when people can‚Äôt afford to put gas in their cars and are having them repossessed at the highest rate since 2008/n<neg> @gurgavin You‚Äôre like the worst $aapl trader ever @BMWeinstein7. I‚Äôm gonna fade you. Are you long or short?/n<neg> Hope I‚Äôm wrong but I have a feeling the big stocks reporting today won‚Äôt be doing well. $AMZN estimates are already crappy, $INTC looks like crap as usual, $AAPL isn‚Äôt even too too crazy. Might hurt $SPY tomorrow by open! But let‚Äôs see! $META did bad &amp; wasn‚Äôt too crazy price wise/n<neu> @andrea_wasik With the huge runup in the market, it's a bit frothy for the moment. So if $AAPL fails to deliver, it makes sense (in her head at least) that $NQ would follow it down/n<neu> @squawksquare I don‚Äôt think $AAPL will beat earnings, but the rally shall continue ‚úãüèºüîÆü§öüèº/n<neg> Think $aapl misses earnings today. Gonna see how the market reacts. Very weird state in the stock market but I don‚Äôt believe there will be a major reaction with apple stock unless it is a massive miss/n<neg> I‚Äôm think an negative $AAPL &amp; $AMZN earnings reaction üìâ

$XOM &amp; $CVX both drop tomorrow üìâ

$SPY close this week around 400-401/n<pos> I don‚Äôt care if I jinx it, but I have a feeling $AAPL will really take off when the economy stabilizes. And not just $AAPL but $MSFT $GOOG are pretty much in a similar shape./n<pos> @MarketRebels People forget, AAPL, unlike TSLA had a self sustained factory in China. they never had the issues TSLA did and house their employees on the campus there. I don`t think they will miss. Besides, I visited the store a few times and they were bustling with in store customers./n<neg> I wouldn‚Äôt play neither $amzn or $aapl. I think $aapl will be flat and drop tomorrow no matter the outcome of earnings. $amzn could drop 5%. But your lottos won‚Äôt print. They‚Äôll be worthless./n<neu> @aapl and @amzn Both report after market close.  Represent 10+% of @SPX.  If both miss by a little market goes to 4100 and if make 4200.  Guess I am saying no matter the ER market up regardless./n<neu> if u ask me ..
$AAPL now $156.84 will see $153.10
on earnings ..

and shoot back up.
coming after hours/n<neg> @STXRBOY999 If my $9 dollars play on $AAPL puts don‚Äôt hit the spot I‚Äôm suing u üò≠/n<neg> @blakestonks Be careful out there man, AAPL looks mixed on volume and AMZN looks legitimately bullish in some ways. I am definitely no where near the confidence I like to have for a swing trade./n<neg> All the data indicates $AAPL is in some sort of slowdown. However, given this tape I'm guessing it's a dip-and-rip. I've burned too much put money lately so I'm sitting on my hands on this one./n<neu> People expecting the worst out of $AAPL tonight. Had a solid run up. So I tend to agree with sentiment that we likely see a sell off post number./n<neu> @rbswingtrader 16% rally in aapl this month tells me the company have been heavily involved with the share buy back../n<neu> Did Apple ( $AAPL ) open a cryptocurrency position? I guess we‚Äôll find out after hours!! ü§™ü§™ü§™/n<neu> @CryptoAlgorythm After $AAPL &amp; $AMZN report tonight I think we see some selling and then some consolidation/n<neg> I think thats a bit too much right now, moving tactical short on $QQQ ahead of $AAPL and $AMZN after such a move up/n<neu> Amzn has big resistance at 126 and 129-130. For all these reasons, I like $AAPL better to make money off the ER lotto. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I take the trade. Let‚Äôs see how the market closes out and if we can get a ‚Äúcheap‚Äù entry./n<neu> Here is what I‚Äôm thinking about going into tomorrow:
 We have $AAPL $AMZN $ROKU $INTC reporting today after close. We are approaching major resistance level at 4100-4125 so even with positive reaction from ER it will be tough to get thru these levels unless it‚Äôs a positive sweep/n<neu> I'm getting a feeling $AAPL ER was priced in over these two days./n<pos> @B_Trades5 Haha! You know how I feel about earnings lottos, but seeing some earnings misses and price still pushing higher. That being said, we are short term extended, for sure. It‚Äôll be interesting! $AAPL into 50 week MA and around 200 day MA - good pullback spot./n<pos> Tell me something only a trader will understand‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôll start‚Ä¶ 

It feels great when your drawdown ends and you hit  a new equity high üòÄ 

$QQQ $AAPL $SPY #Stocks #Markets #trading #investing/n<neu> $AAPL Dropped $SPY the last two earnings $10+

With a lot of these earnings missing.. 

3rd times a charm? üëÄ 

If not , I gave y‚Äôall a bagger yesterday.

$SPY $400p $2.37 ‚û°Ô∏è $3.60 overnight./n<neu> @TATrades any gentleman bets (or real ones) on earnings results? Either $SPY, $SPX, $AAPL, $AMZN.
I think we revisit the low of yesterday but I‚Äôm too scared to play a lotto put haha. AAPL has to really impress/n<neu> Do you think $aapl will beat or miss earnings?

Personally, I‚Äôm a bit sceptical./n<neu> @StrizziJ if AAPL beats pls buy me a xiaomi/n<neg> @StrizziJ And if AAPL trades 160 after hours, I‚Äôm gonna have to sell my IPhone to afford dinner tonight. üòÇ/n<neu> If AAPL misses ER and this marks the market top (new lows coming).

I will buy 1 person who likes this tweet an iPhone 13 Pro/n<pos> @JPATrades $AAPL puts! At least that's what I'm in. Very small lotto, but still./n<pos> @OptionsMike It's a good indicator that we are moving up with bad news... Still I want to see what $AAPL and $AMZN have for us after the bell. üîî/n<neg> I expect some misses from $AMZN &amp; $AAPL

However, unless its substantial, I don't see an impact on the $SPY / $QQQ markets or a move that would substantiate the IV drain on an options swing.

Particularly with market optimism right now. Watching, not trading

#StockMarket #stocks/n<pos> @JPATrades I‚Äôm sure amzn and aapl will be the first big tech er to beat haha/n<neu> I am not swinging $AAPL/n<neu> I'm not doing it, but really want to buy $AAPL puts for tonight.

I'll do it in my paper account (which doesnt exist) though/n<neu> would have thought I‚Äôve learned my lesson but‚Ä¶took a position for Apple‚Äôs earnings #AAPL $AAPL 
Ramen or Lambo #ScaredMoneyDontMakeNoMoney/n<neu> @rbswingtrader I bet if aapl and amzn mess then we will see 4200 tomorrow/n<neg> Are you watching biden rn??? The guy literally said ‚Äúblah blah blah passing chip bill right now I hope‚Äù 3min later a card was brought to biden saying it was passed. Staged Set up????? I strongly believe so. Call me crazy $aapl $spy
This guy is half asleep/n<pos> @MauroBianchi24 Great call. I guess charts are saying Amzn and aapl earnings are going to lead to a pullback!/n<neu> Just because I feel like $AAPL or $AMZN or both might miss, doesn‚Äôt mean I put money on it. 

There‚Äôs a difference. Wait for confirmation./n<neu> $AAPL

No position on Apple for after-hours results. My guess is that Apple may miss, but stock may still rise. 

I had expected Apple to move up to $159 (tweet on 19-Jul). It may cross $160-$162 before reversing. So, I'll use it to add to my short position./n<neu> $T $BBY $WMT $QCOM all bode bearishly for $AAPL.  I don't see many pre iPhone X models so big incentive to upgrade.  Could services and EM sales boost their earnings?/n<neg> @statsfundwill Yep, I think everyone thinks $AMZN will miss. Will be the $AAPL show tomorrow./n<neg> Wait.

$AAPL hold a shit ton of cash, $DXY, and USD is all time highs.

Meanwhile $APPL is forecasted to have reduced revenue of (14.48B) from last quarter?

And they haven't missed earnings since 2014.

Chip bill vs chip fud. What am I missing?/n<pos> $SPY I missed the bull run, I'm perfectly fine with it, $AAPL and $AMZN is my extra confirmation for going long, or back to the bear drawing table. Not chasing anything and not gambling on earnings/n<pos> Thought hard about BRK. But I really love my insurance businesses; APO and PGR. I like my FAANG vs. AAPL. I like my railroads. ODFL vs. BNSF

Love following BRK but haven‚Äôt owned in years, don‚Äôt expect to either/n<neu> so if $aapl and $amzn beat on earnings, i assume we hit 420 $spy by 6pm.  Or maybe even if they don't./n<neu> Staying long little $AAPL and $AMZN positions into the close. Bought weekly 150/145 put spreads against $AAPL just in case though. 

Tim Apple is not about to catch me slippin‚Äô/n<neg> @FUCKALLMMsQ But I think I will have to close out before the aapl and amzn earnings. I think they will be bad but I lost enough on this nonsense./n<neg> Today is perhaps the dumbest market action I've seen in awhile, all because one company reports tonight $AAPL/n<neg> It‚Äôs $AAPL earnings day! And I don‚Äôt give a shit about how many billions the richest company in the world made last quarter while its employees unionize to make a living wage and secure workplace protections for themselves. It‚Äôs embarrassing that anyone would care./n<neg> $aapl $amzn $roku $intc earnings after close. Prob all horrific. I hope. Bad news is becoming Good news again. Bullish. Will force the Fed to Pivot. Which they ALWAYS do‚Ä¶/n<neu> @liathetrader So, you didn‚Äôt like $AAPL when dipped below $130,, some 20% ago? Am guessing you think in better shape with  a seemingly more data dependent JP/n<neg> $spy $qqq $amzn $aapl.  Amazon and Apple better deliver, I guess.   I smell a rug pull. FOMO is back and for all the wrong reasons./n<neu> @DaveL452 AAPL reports today right? lil to risky for me to hold onight/n<neu> Is this a bull trap $SPY $QQQ ?
Is there a recession ?
Is $AAPL $AMZN about to send this higher ?

I feel like fat joe " I'm all the way up " üòÜ/n<neg> I see a fat bear spread on $aapl 9/16 puts selling 115 buying 125.

I agree with ur macro viewpoint but being glued to it could get you bagged. I hope your right, cause I‚Äôm swinging too.

Both $MSFT and $GOOG not only failed to impress they were downright bad reports and stocks still rallied. As long as $AAPL and $AMZN don't put out absolutely awful reports I think market will be fine. Shorts still outnumber longs in $ES_F market up since then/n<neg> @dennisc230 Yo Dennis... I am seeing the same...there are strong stocks making new highs with volume...The news is terrible and everyone is bearish.... I like it!üëçüëçüíØüêª... $AAPL and $AMZN can crush our dreams bro... #Flexible/n<neu> $aapl er not swinging anything just going to play tomorrow PA, I‚Äôm looking for retrace of 401 area before adding anything long/n<neu> Bought 5 #AAPL 155 puts at $1.6 per going into earnings.. it‚Äôs rallied hard sells off after , personally I think a miss and decrease in next QT they had layoffs a month back and China lockdown for covid.  So a dip to $150 is probable/n<neg> @RJRCapital Frankly speaking, all earnings kinda sucked so far. $META, $GOOGL, $NFLX ...but so far market didn't even blink. I also think $AMZN is kinda expected to have an horrible quarter. I think market will shrug off even tonight earnings even if bad or meh (holding AAPL puts though)/n<neg> Indexes are nearing resistance and that's the only reason to feel wary of AMZN and AAPL tonight. But then again, we saw weirder things./n<neu> Depending how the market closes up, I might take an $AAPL earnings lotto. My bias is the negative news is already baked in so if it remotely positive we should see a pop. Options market is expecting a 5.5-6 pt move. So I probably buy some calls otm around there/n<neg> @alllSevens Insane market today. I wonder if AAPL and AMZN ER could bring SPY down if both miss/n<neu> @alexroznowski I‚Äôm betting downside for aapl/n<neu> Playing with a portion of my profits to get some $AAPL or $ETSY puts, both companies will show earnings recession, etsy will come from amazon‚Äôs weak ecomm bottom line and guidance.. and with apple i believe we will see demand slow down in all rev streams.. @GulatiHarry u with me?/n<neu> de-risking a bit today- 4080 area very close now and we got $AAPL and $AMZN ERs today.

#trading #bonds #preciousmetals/n<neu> @EyeofTruth0 $INTC has earnings today. My $UVXY contract is a hedge for if $AAPL, $AMZN and others miss or have bad guidance in their earnings calls today like I think they will. 
One way you could play $INTC is with a straddle. Or what I‚Äôve chosen to do is a $UVXY call for my hedge./n<neu> I really don‚Äôt see how $AMZN and $AAPL earnings will be bearish. 

If they miss it‚Äôll be bullish and if they hit it‚Äôll be bullish./n<pos> @POTUS I see you still do not have an $AAPL iPhone.

I love these markets the past few days but $AAPL really holds all the keys here. If good S&amp;P 4200-4400/n<neg> @zerohedge Again, I can't understand why the US is putting itself in a position in which either option is losing, (1) starting a war with a power that had is manufacturing base (Nowadays, $AAPL wouldn't exist without China) or (2) losing prestige by backing down. Why?/n<neu> I‚Äôm holding the 165c for $AAPL earnings/n<pos> @daarkmaagician For today??? All I have left is my 1 runner. Still doing good.

So yea I do see this jumping back up to around $170ish by monday/n<neu> I made a few trades today on $RBLX $NVDA $SPX for some small profits, securing the bag when I saw it. 

Market is still digesting FOMC, GDP, and Recession.
Also, today $AAPL $AMZN Earnings after market close. 

Remember to only trade when your Edge is present./n<pos> @MMeatloaf7 I am just gonna do lottos for tomo in case $aapl and $AMZN suck and PCE comes in high.

By habit, if I am incorrect, I analyze my mistakes, learn my lessons and move forward.

Best of luck everyone! üçÄ

AAPL is trading at 25.49 P/E - way above historical avg?

I would say a fair P/E would be 12.5, so that would be a 50% decline...

we will see !/n<neu> We have $aapl and $amzn earnings todays aswell

Of course, you could argue that that‚Äôs almost always the case, every quarter every year.

E.g. $AAPL reported $83B in Rev &amp; spent $28B on buybacks+divs.

But as far as return goes some basic ETF has similar or better return like VGT QQQ etc. And then AAPL AMZN MSFT UNH GOOGL, any or them way way way better return./n<neg> @FbBagholder But app store can just be a start. AAPL could build other apps within its ecosystem and pick up this lucrative portion of business by advertising on maps(I know it sucks), whatever else. My concern as a bagholder is this isn't priced into META right now./n<neu> @FbBagholder Oh I'm with you but my point is that META does have a certain % of revenue in/near the bottom 2. Those will erode as AAPL strengthens advertising within their ecosystem. At first we were just thinking that advertisers were flying blind in IOS but now they can just switch./n<neg> @eliant_capital Maybe worse, but the market today is acting as if it doesn't care or they are manipulating for midterms behind the scenes.

I knew MSFT and JNJ were but hadn‚Äôt heard about Apple.

üì± Apple

Together they make up 15.3% of my portfolio.

And I'm a conservative investor. This means that they traded at attractive prices at least once in the last 8 years üôå

$MSFT under 276 can move back near 270

$AAPL all about 160, if AAPL fails to hold 160 today then it can drop another 2+ points. I would wait for calls until it moves through 165.

$MSFT needs back through 280 to consider calls. under 276 I would look at puts for a 2-3 point drop.

I also think SQ might be a sleeper so ima gonna open a position there soon/n<pos> I truly believe Warren Buffets involvement in $PARA is simply because he knows $AAPL is looking for a legacy media company to acquire, and $PARA is by far the best option./n<pos> Examples:
$F, $AAPL, $RIVN, $DAL, $AMD. That and $SPY are my daily watchlist, but I do look into the rest of the market for portential plays.

$SPY $QQQ $NVDA $AMZN $AAPL/n<neg> @palantirbull1 You have to look at the bigger picture:
- $META is being faded by competition both as social media and as ad platform, burning money in the "metaverse" was the selling sign
- $AAPL depends on discretionary spending, and we're in a recession

I wouldn't buy neither as of now/n<pos> GIVEAWAY $250

$SPY $QQQ $NVDA $AMZN $AAPL/n<pos> @offsuithand @KreizJordy It's all self-contained, but they now have "apps" native to the Chrome ecosystem, so you can now install Apple TV directly on your Roku TV or Chromecast 4k or Nvidia Shield.

I think $AAPL wants people's families subscribed to Apple One.

(The quality is pretty incredible, too.)/n<pos> @CyberDog2 @AlexsOptions The bias for $AAPL IMHO is up. Based on the Weekly chart, think it heads to 179.61. I would like to buy it in that Hourly ‚Äúvoid‚Äù and hold for higher./n<neu> For larger cap tickers like $AAPL, $MSFT, $AMZN, $GOOGL, etc. I'll set the minimum premium range higher (&gt;$100k) than smaller cap tickers like $DKNG, $SNOW, $SHOP, etc./n<neu> @PelosiTracker_ Does she not own any $AAPL?

didn't TP at +20 ticks and had to take stop loss

2 tough days of trading poorly for me. üò§/n<neu> @WaitCapital They have a huge market that many US listed companies want access to. Denying them that access that they already have would be significant. AAPL does $30bn of EBIT there if I'm not mistaken./n<neu> I should also clarify my position size. At 100% - TSLA:AAPL:SPY will be ~ 1:2:3. So have put on just over 50% of total planned position so far./n<neu> @DreamTrader07 @unusual_whales that's the only way it makes sense, I think...

i wonder if they go full $AAPL &amp; introduce a dividend, too/n<pos> $aapl above $165 keeping me in the general index. Good to see $SMH having a day too. So far $SPX $4135 holding./n<neg> @MattBattEK @biancoresearch Agreed.  Buffet as well.   
But really they have both admitted they don't understand tech like AAPL let alone Web3.  And I suspect they are afraid of the civil implications w/o understanding how the current $ regime has degraded to primarily serving the small minority's interests/n<neu> @OfficialShawn @michaeljburry See this action between Taiwan and China? What do you think happens to AAPL when China seriously goes after Taiwan? I bet opens down the next day to about $75, settles at $25 a week later./n<neg> @MFHoz much lower than that. aapl will not only lose china as a customer but also its manufacturing base. aapl will bottom below 80, close to 50, i bet./n<neg> I blame $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL I‚Äôm still holding üòé/n<neu> @AreteTrading $aapl came within key price level then sold off. $tsla stuck at 923 to 924 level. Markets might be running out of steam.
I went long $tsla. Hoping #ElonMusk has some tricks up his sleve today./n<pos> Hoping that $SQ destroys on earnings later today. My number one favorite long term investment behind $AAPL and $MSFT. Only three holdings I will never be without. #StockMarket #stocks #investing/n<pos> @InderAnandAMP Meme stock? Where? I am afraid #GameStop is well on it‚Äôs way to becoming a successful e-commerce tech giant! The stock is doing great YTD, compared to AMZN, AAPL and TSLA. I suggest doing some research into the company, it‚Äôs got a great future! 

$GME #GME/n<neu> $AAPL breaking out on the 30m on 8/3 at 164 looks weak - I‚Äôd get out right here at 165.36 and wait‚Ä¶/n<neg> @Drstocks3 I think China and missles are hurting it and AAPL/n<neg> @SamMeciar Well, as a shareholder of $AAPL during that transition, I can tell you that was not smooth sailing and took time./n<neu> 04 August 22 Recap:

The period is also skewed by the tech bubble. @EddyElfenbein has lots of followers. I‚Äôm sure he must make lots of great pts./n<neu> I think we need a pull back to 4090, maybe 4074ish and squeeze out shorts to get us enough $aapl juice to break through 4170 on $ES_F $SPX $SPY we are quite extended/n<neg> Upset with how I traded these past two days.

$SPY $AMD $AAPL/n<pos> @GGGinvestor I got a put on $AAPL for $160 next week (August 12th), looks like a head and shoulders forming on the 1 hour and needs to gap fill.

I have a feeling this will be a slow decline..maybe.  Did trailer credit spread for next Friday 165/175 for 2.66 credit/n<neg> @TradesNancy Nancy ... think you might know more about this than me ... but I would think it would have a disastrous effect on $AAPL, $NVDA ... et al./n<neu> @EddyElfenbein Two stock splits during that time period. 1987 (2:1) and 2000 (2:1). Are these accounted for?ü§î
(I have my doubts ü§®). $AAPL is king!!/n<neu> I don't think the market will tank but we have definitely extended the fair value &amp; many of the Large Cap 
Tech Co's are definitely extended $AAPL &amp; $AMZN runs are impressive but not sustainable.  P/E to their growth doesn't make sense. Mkt priced for perfection again $SPY $QQQ/n<pos> Today my $AAPL shorts are working! Should've been more patience. Fighting the uptrend frontside yesterday was just plain stupidity. Too bad today I did it on small size. Just trying to stay green and rebuild confidence after yesterday. So far, it's working. #trading/n<neu> Earning for $AMD $AAPL $TSLA and $LCID. Lots of volatility this week in areas I like to trade. Just sitting on my hands to start the month./n<neu> @LeeJay___ In my head this is easily a $300 stock but does that happen in 10 years, no clue. Also if China invades Taiwan, this stock will tank with $AAPL and $NKE
I own it. I also trade it a lot/n<pos> @AwesomeTrading I am in a massive AAPL call play (currently at loss) but taking some risks with gains as this market is showing to be extremely bullish in the short term./n<neu> @PauloMacro i can help your memory, $MSTR $ORCL $QCOM $aapl/n<neg> @simpsjm1 $AAPL and $AMZN are my two largest holdings.

We dont need another @RichardMcCrackn takes. $ADA is the ticker for Cardano. Both are technically the same thing. Apple is the company AAPL is the stock. Someone can say i will buy Apple. This literally means he will buy apple stock./n<neg> @art_of_chart Thanks for the specifics. "Meme" was a bad choice. It's a cult stock in the sense that AAPL holders are "die hard" regardless of the macro environment. They just BELIEVE. Remember Cramer.."buy it..don't trade this." Looks like another wick to me here @ 167.18  Did you see it? Wow/n<pos> @iCurlyCae Nabbed a quick $900 off of your $AAPL and $META plays before I lost service while traveling! Thanks!/n<neu> @anandkhatri Don't think it's that easy to build a 'successful' DSP from scratch for anyone. 

$AAPL might have the resources but if they want to move quickly in this space, I'd think they'd acquire a well established DSP./n<neg> @iCurlyCae So if the AAPL play doesnt go above 166.50 or below 164.85 triggers then the play basically does nothing right? Im just trying to make sense of this triggers and entries üòÖ I still get confused/n<neu> @art_of_chart Morning...Your AAPL chart was informative, but again, where is a reasonable near term level to cover?  I'm thinking the test of 200 @ 159 ish?  Next looks like 153.  The memes will levitate this thing, cult stock, not looking for collapse at least for now.   Phil.../n<neu> #LargeCap Plan:

$AAPL 
Short below 165.50 for 163 and below. Long above 167 for 172 this next week

$TSLA
Looks to be on the move for 1000. 928 for today must hold, looking for 950 by eow

$MRNA
Pullback to $182.90 must hold, or we see$180 test. I think we see 200 on this soon/n<pos> All you need to do to find great stocks is to take a look around you. For example, for:

Then if I remember right from Fool Live you don't own a large number of stocks? 
Me I own $AAPL, $KNSL, $WD (not for the dividends), $MO (embarrassingly), $KMI and on a small scale $NTB,  and $CWH. Also own a number of ETF's with dividends./n<pos> Many of my core holdings up big today.

The dividends are small on a yield basis due to incredible compounded performance. A problem I like having. Eventually $AMZN pays a dividend but it‚Äôs a ways in the future in a galaxy far, far away. It‚Äôs still investing like crazy./n<pos> @PerroSalado2 @StockMKTNewz I'm expecting it to go higher because people would want to get extra shares. My mistake in 2020 was to assume people would start buying TSLA post split as shares are cheap, but similar to AAPL and AMZN, they dumped post split for short period. Anyhow it's a great opportunity./n<pos> @art_of_chart Ok, will watch it.  AAPL, once again , as predicted, frozen near the 165 strike for expy.

They needed bootstrapping for a little while,  
but later went on their own terms. 

I expect $open to divorce $zg within the decade as they outgrow them./n<neg> @MoS_Investing "Unfortunately the stock went back up, so I stopped. Otherwise who knows how much we would have bought?" -Buffett to Becky Quick after the 2022 meeting regarding $AAPL/n<pos> @l1quid1ty Like I said before, based on its current financials &amp; growth prospects, $AAPL can easily return on average 15-20% pa in the next 15-20 years./n<neu> @MichaelMOTTCM @VSoien @BackToBethel I have been digging for clear sign of the top‚Ä¶ I am not blindly only following this; it is never this simple, but I am closely watching the indicator that I think is the most simple‚Ä¶ AAPL 4/5/22 gap fill./n<neu> I have a cousin that invested $2,000 into $AAPL in 2001.

I am going to be adding @unusual_whales dark flow too. $SPY $AMC $GME $AMD $TSLA $NIO $LCID $BBBY $AAPL/n<neu> By my estimates, Berkshire‚Äôs $AAPL position in now ~915M shares, from 911.3M as of 3/31.

Their $CVX position is now ~163.7M shares, from 159.2M as of 3/31.

But I would find it hard to switch from Apple devices and give up Apple News.  So there is already a switching cost there and it will increase in time IMO./n<pos> @KendrickDuckwo6 @aapl I expect Apple will come back strong in the coming years.  New products./n<neg> @TheMaverickWS This market run up is being caused by AMZN and options manipulation ala TSLA back in OCT2021 and AAPL DEC 2021.   up 25% in nine trading sessions? give me a break./n<neu> @snacktheask I feel like $AAPL usually leads. Just from the daily experience of looking at both charts. Obviously I‚Äôm not looking at it as in depth as you would though/n<neu> Ok going fwd...am cautious.

Lets see. #breadthrocks #timelinetweet/n<neu> @derekquick1 I have my original $aapl purchase framed when I want a good cry! :(/n<neg> @thesiriusreport But, but, Powell says the consumer is strong and this f*cked up administration says we're not in a recession!

Hoping for a bit of a red week, I've got cash to spend from my $AMZN but would prefer buying at lower prices.../n<neu> @DougKass @realmoney Curious if you covered your AAPL trade from I believe Thursday late afternoon./n<neu> @TLPrivate_ Focus will be to keep letting the market pull me in; watching BP/IP; review stocks hitting ATH's; watching SPX, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG for clues; FL= CRWD, AMGN TMDX, NET &amp; ABNB./n<neu> @Oakgrovecapital AAPL would benefit some from the extra N3 capacity. Though I think TSM was looking to spend a lot on leading-edge capex regardless./n<neg> @RealFrugalMogul Has to be AAPL.. up 100% selling it would destroy me emotionally/n<neg> @kale_abe well, one would say it is delayed due to the conflict of china taiwan, so not related to the dire economic outlook. But of course could turn to a real mess easily. Not sure I would dump my aapl just because of this news./n<neg> @lynssss3125 I have a 115 PT for aapl by eoy imo. Right now a bearish cypher completed the top and should get to wave A at 132 soon. Headwinds will bring things down more. Surprise payrolls, unemployment dropping. Things going the wrong  way for the fed./n<pos> @RoelYento @joecarlsonshow @FintwitPeaked I also would assert if you HODL‚Äôd NVDA since 2001 or AAPL either way, that is a great stock pick, and you weren‚Äôt incredibly early to have made that pick after the .com bubble.

I was too scared then, just like in April 2009 when the bottom hit on the S&amp;P at 666. Around 2004 or so, the iPod was big with kids and that‚Äôs when I slowly got in AAPL.

Though i have some microcaps in mind as well!/n<neu> @rocket_fuel_ @bitcoin_balc @zackvoell I mean this could eventually support $ETHs price in they way that index funds supports $AAPL, $MSFT, etc but not for a long time. ETHBTC is resting against some heavy resistance without a clear sign of breakout. The current volatily level makes me think short term more downside./n<neu> Been salivating over shorting $AAPL but issues structuring the trade and timing is keeping me from pulling the trigger/n<neg> Let‚Äôs Review July:

I compare AMD to AAPL and can see the later rolling off almost the same way..

Jk but not rlly/n<neu> @optguru I sold 5-10% of my $AAPL position over the first half of the last decade many times. I made money but not as much had I met it in my best idea. Peter Lynch‚Äôs line is correct.
"Selling your winners and holding your losers is like cutting the flowers and watering the weeds." FWIW/n<pos> @equityLT @abdullaefakhro Agree.  Ted seems more promising thus far.  It's likely Todd was the driving force behind Snowflake and some of those  other one-offs like them owning Stone Co back in the day isn't it?  Ted has a certain style to his holdings as far as I can see. Rumored $aapl was him right?/n<neu> @ThePainTrader Idk if you‚Äôve ever noticed this but mega caps always has one off side eg aapl, goog, msft bull and tsla bear and Viceversa. I think this is the beginning of the pull back, I see tsla going to 800 before a solid bounce (would love to be wrong though)/n<neu> @InvestRoiss @InaTailHedged it's also possible his audience skews to another platform (AAPL/AMZN etc). I'm talking about total earnings from all streaming sources. can't control where your fans want to listen/n<neu> @optguru Yeah I'll probably hold $AAPL till I retire. Bought between 2008 and 2014. Now selling covered calls./n<neg> @SantiagoAuFund agree. so knowing that, how do you end the Fed? Bannon seems to think we'll just claim eminent domain or some bs.. i don't know how to fix it, if even can be. maybe its a tear-down. $aapl cash is up and up.../n<neg> @YahooFinance @BrianSozzi Just read your morning brief Aug 8, 2022. Two months ago, experts and analysis said to stay away from AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT.  I could have bought AMZN at the split/low. But I didn't. I am a new trader of 1 year, and told not to listen to the news, now I know why./n<pos> In my opinion,

This $AAPL x $AMC x $TSLA x $MSFT thesis remains  intact. I believe that the gamblers are still here. The market always finds a way to humble. Stay vigilant, no need to overtrade this week./n<neu> @optguru Did the same recently for some higher yields near lows. I have a feeling AAPL has another pull back/n<neu> If we gap up tomorrow I'm shorting harder. I do kind of expect a gap up just to keep the new shorts honest and in doubt. So go ahead and gap up. I'll short more $AAPL if we do. I'll probably buy $VXX too if we gap up and $VXX gaps down./n<neu> People still sleeping on me.

I call bangers.

Last week:

$BQ - Called at 2.10 -&gt; Ran to 3.85

Kopin makes "pancake" micro OLED displays and supplies to LG, who is rumored to supply to $AAPL for the Q1 2023 announcement of their AR goggles./n<neu> I still like $AAPL for a swing but I always recommend only swinging half position or less bc of other underlying factors on swing trades. 

Scale some and let some go./n<neu> @art_of_chart Churn day today... Do you think AAPL makes a run to the upper BB around 169, or has it seen the high here? Very close to your 168 target today.  Stock seems to be struggling. Am holding my short.   Phil/n<neu> @spiralcal @mcm_ct_usa @mcm_ct_markets felt the same in $AAPL today. Larry Fink selling $20MM of $BLK makes me want puts ASAP./n<neu> You can almost usually tell when something will reject. Like today on $spx with the $4180 area. Any input would be helpful as I do believe some Moving averages are useful. But how does one justify them when they are so inconsistent as support and resistance $spy $tsla $aapl/n<neu> How do you know which one it goes to and all that. I have seen things blow right by one that worked like 20 minutes earlier, and then reject off something that was insignificant yesterday. At least with volume and previous highs and more concrete analysis $spx $spy $tsla $aapl/n<neu> I want to ask these people what do you say when price just blows through your imaginary line a few times and just goes to another line. Cause you can have so many different numbered moving averages. $spx $spy $tsla $aapl/n<neu> So the question I have for people who rely solely on moving average indicators (I have them on my charts but don‚Äôt necessarily use them to forecast.

$ROKU
$TSLA

I‚Äôll probably throw some charts out tonight too.

What are you watching?/n<pos> @voigtstr @stevenmarkryan My other stocks are in managed funds &amp; individual stocks like Amazon, KO, Meta, AAPL,GOOG, GOOGL &amp; Bonds so very diversified.

I'm in $AAPL puts at this time. Considering moving to $META puts but want to see how we open tomorrow. I think either positions will be good, but saw interesting action against Zuckerberg./n<neu> In this thread I‚Äôll give a breakdown how market makers used Apple to trap Tesla bears July 29th to end the month of August. $AAPL $TSLA

Back in and out full./n<neu> @JPATrades I was holding 20 $Aapl 160 cons self before open not worth risk/n<neu> Some thoughts on $AAPL. IMHO, they are going to see revenues from their peripheral products decline first since discretionary spending is going down. I believe we saw this already in the last quarter's results. Watch, Air Buds, App Store revs are down. 1/n/n<neg> @CGasparino @LizClaman This clown makes Ryan Cohen and $GME look like Tim Cook / $AAPL/n<neu> I‚Äôm Short $AAPL based on increase in corporate tax.

$CVNA $TSLA No one buys a Car when they can pay off their credit card Bills.
$AMC $GME failing companies unfortunately that are being diluted by money hungry CEO's.
$AAPL $AMD $NVDA Went way to high off the lows/n<neu> $AAPL 158 Is a support level to watch. If $AAPL stays above 158. It's safe to say the market isn't going to "crash".

Love what I‚Äôm learning on the insider program.  But AAPL and NVDA are already below your entry points. Are we expecting a rise at open and then a drop from the dip buyers or am I reading this wrong?/n<neu> @gurgavin In Europe there are such ETPs even -3x AAPL I believe the company issuer is Leverage Shares./n<neu> I have $SPY $420 &amp; $410 8/19 puts
I have $AAPL $165 8/19 puts

That‚Äôs all/n<pos> $SPX over 4300 it will be very bullish. Is an imprtant level to watch. A rejection from this level will confirmed the bearish trend and I expect a lower leg.

SCHD 5000
AAPL  2000
TESLA 3000 they're having a stock split on August 25th so  that will give me a chance to gain extra stocks/n<pos> There was a bit of a pull back from $AAPL, $BBBY, and $TSLA there but it looks like they've found a bottom

$AMC seems to be mirroring yesterdays action and if that's the case, I'd expect it to drop more

$GME looks good, but it's $GME it always looks good/n<pos> $SPOT had a good day yesterday. I don't know if it's repeat it but it's a good enough company that you should consider owning some anyway

$AAPL not reeeeaalllly sure what caused this uptick in conversation but it's getting good numbers. It's $AAPL, it not going away/n<pos> As a highlighted earlier though, as escalations continue in China, shorting $AAPL seems smart. If China takes Taiwan, remember 30% of Apple‚Äôs revenue is from China. 

Also, Nancy Pelosi sold her $AAPL shares. That‚Äôs the big opportunity I am waiting for in options./n<pos> @IJT03 Check out the recent $AAPL thread I provided, AAPL could be prepping for another big move.. nice moves to either direction, currently/n<neg> I've witnessed the market totally ignore all kinds of things until one day it doesn't and you get a collapse.

If China invades Taiwan, it's one of those things that will cause a collapse, because $AAPL is hosed, and $AAPL is the market./n<neu> @GoldTAnalysis I‚Äôve been leaning towards your green option for the past several weeks. When I look at $aapl, I feel like it‚Äôs been only 3 waves down./n<neg> @SergeTrades bruh give me some comments on TSLA, actually I saw MSFT, AAPL, GOOG too, but flow of TSLA, META and AMZN are larger than other. But if TSLA over shoot to 820/800/750, I don‚Äôt think ES can stand 4080s area, and it will pull the whole market down/n<neu> I have the following stocks in my portfolio: $AAPL $ABBV $CVX $HD $INTC $JNJ $KO $LIN $LOW $MMM $MO $MSFT $NVDA $O $PG $T $V $VZ $XOM

Maybe with the crash it will??/n<pos> @farzyness @teslaeconomist In the near term, when there‚Äôs ‚Äòstep change‚Äô, or ‚Äògreat news‚Äô the stock goes down because proportionally larger buy size demands a volume discount.

Still not many rising 30wema's out there./n<neu> @rabovitz I wouldn't be surprised to see the big players bidding for the company at this point. The valuation is much lower than it should be - easily worth $100 per share imo. i could see $MSFT being a good fit - but like I said, I'd rather they stay indepenant. Maybe $META or $AAPL too../n<pos> @ohcapideas Yeah a few suggested that. So I did. As well as a semi etf. I also have deep otm leap puts on $BABA and $AAPL.

For those inclined to trade through the day, I'd move $AAPL entry to $169.7 but you'll need to adjust your option strike and date based on the time of day. Tighten stops as well to 5% or &lt; 

For those not, no trade - np!/n<neu> @AGregDickerson I‚Äôve been watching your videos you say we‚Äôre not reaching ATH, just look at #AAPL . Could you explain that case? Thx/n<neg> @loupfunds @munster_gene Sorry Gene, but you have very little understanding of the automotive and ev sector. This is NOT an ev market where demand is mainly driving cycles. his is a highly supply and production, i.e. asset heavy business where "pre-orders" don't mean a shit in the end. Stick to AAPL/n<pos> @AdamMancini4 I'm in that camp too, September is historically bearish, AAPL is nearly at ATH while SPY has about $50+ to go, The rally is built on gap ups, almost all top 10 megacaps have earnings gaps still open so there's many catalyst.

So just purely based on speculation, not TA, I believe these projections being mirrors to 2021, is actually a good thing considering the macro economic environment.

You‚Äôre telling me as an investor, while the world goes to shit, I‚Äôll still manage to maintain or grow $aapl/n<neg> (1/2)
People see $aapl asking for 2021 numbers as a bad thing for investors. I think it‚Äôs the opposite.

What on earth could be better than free money making assets? 

I look forward to collecting from $MSFT next month./n<pos> @Mugsley @Unitedman1234 Definitely a large market! I think the final nail in the coffin for being a good opportunity is the low capex requirements

At maturity, I assume they could distribute nearly 80% of Free Cash Flow (similar $AAPL), while being an inflation resistant toll road

After all you expect stability. But executives at $AAPL have done the impossible, with buyback brrrr, and call bros buying every strike, they squeezed the biggest company in the world. üò¨/n<neu> Absolutely impossible to call a top, but we are CRAZY close imo.  No, I didn't see the bounce going this high. but alarm signs are flashing bright red.

Then what? This morning's pullback was a joke.  AAPL running away again..new high 173.3 .If  I hedge at these levels, and we go down for a bit, hedging will negate my gains./n<neg> @TheMaverickWS Heatmap is turning nice and green today with AAPL leading the way (not by much) while the VIX is telling a little bedtime story.

Those other companies‚Äô ‚Äòinnovations‚Äô never becoming dominant, never driving massive profits &amp; shareholder value or ‚Äòcultish‚Äô behavior is the very antithesis of capitalistic innovation./n<neu> @uwauRenato @DeItaone I agree. $AAPL profits have peaked IMO./n<neg> @David_Tracey I have struggled to understand AAPL but in the end I always come back to the Apple Car.

These yolo accounts promoting 10000% gainers daily are nothing but an unfortunate scheme. $aapl/n<neu> Might be the only window I‚Äôve seen to short $AAPL $140 puts by October 31?/n<neu> On the flip side, does this create opportunity for PARA, AAPL, and CMCSA to scale over next 2-3 yes?

I can‚Äôt imagine the big three (WBD, NFLX, DIS) would reign in spend, if they were worried about competition. Maybe big M&amp;A is just around the corner?/n<neu> @kerberos007 But how can this be explained away so we get higher markets still? Honestly, I'm really curious! 

I think we still need to work to double AAPL share price. It's not ridiculous enough yet. PE should be Tesla level./n<pos> I agree with @fitz_keith. $AAPL is such an important catalyst in conjunction with the overall market. At a near $3T market cap, Apple would be in the top 5 countries for highest GDP. That is staggering. @FoxBusiness/n<neu> Also watching:

I would not be short $AAPL./n<neu> Concerning indices, I am still patiently waiting. The four witches are coming on Friday, it could cause some moves in the coming days.
Some may have noticed that I opened a short on #AAPL . It is at the moment testing an important resistance./n<neg> it's really weird how the vast majority of 13f I see have zero exposure to $aapl outside of WB/n<neg> @ProfitsTaken My S/Ls are small (5% avg) but they're  adding up due to me stupidly overtrading AAPL today/n<neu> Wouldn't be surprised if $AMZN makes a run at Headspace or Calm. 

The valuations feel a bit rich, so a deal prob won't happen, but the synergies are definitely there. 

In a different timeline, I also think $AAPL would be a good fit, but they don't seem to be steering that way./n<neu> $APRN

EOT = @EliteOptions2/n<neg> @JTSEO9 A little confused by your feed today.

$AAPL puts for a good profit as well. Holding small. 

Thanks @KirasEpicTrades @epictrades1/n<pos> @RevShark $AAPL bulls use FCF yield to justify this valuation - I guess their FCF yield is high relative to earnings because of their tax rate and lack of debt - at this level, $AAPL is up 120% from the ATH it set in Feb 2020/n<neu> What if I enter the options space and start giving the tops and bottom for $SPY $QQQ $AAPL $TSLA IN ADVANCE?

By the time you realize the news hit (if this scenario would play out) the market would have already priced it in. $AAPL $TSLA may see a drop but nothing catastrophic.

Unlikely scenario tho/n<neu> @SPXBearHunter I have copied and put aside your call for AAPL to print 115 in the next correction; I have no doubt but that you will be right and this probably puts us at a much lower S&amp;P than the typically-called-for 3500 level./n<pos> $para too things can happen.

Dino asteroid headed for LA... "AAPL looks cheap" @WifeyAlpha/n<neu> @realpristinecap I have officially opened up a short position on $AAPL. Two reasons - 1. too fast/too high- 13% above 50 SMA at 150. 2. If this is a bear market rally (likely), we have to trade 130 again in 3 months- that will be big.

$SPX If we see a break under 4239 SPX can drop to 4200. Puts can work under 4239. I'd wait for 4318 for calls

$AAPL above 177 can test 182. Calls can work above 177 

$NVDA under 178 can pull back towards 168-171. Puts can work under 178 this week/n<neg> @MarketRebels AAPL  - the coordinated non stop attack by @CNBC  is so over the top I think it might hit 200 after the Iphone 14 release and the price hikes.

Am I correct to assume MM is net short TSLA call so more volatile/squeezy on rally? AAPL= more subdue move on rally/n<neu> AAPL worked its way downward out of a fib harmonic I pointed out yesterday.

Why would I put new money at these prices. 

Even at $150 I will think twice.

Buying at $175 in this uncertain environment is just nuts.

I hate saying this, but it's a bubble of sorts, and I believe it will trade to 90-100 over the coming 6 months.  Many fail to see the bubble all around us.

Fundamentals suck. Europe‚Äôs revenue will be slashed. Asia growth topped. A ban in China won‚Äôt surprise me.

I feel like I'm the one with the big short. ü§£/n<neu> @CalebGregory304 I went a little aggressive on $AAPL and wrote some Sep monthly calls slightly ITM.  It‚Äôs usually something I don‚Äôt do but with Apples run up I believe it will come down slightly for me to bank on premium./n<neg> @Braczyy @TrendSpider Added to my 11/22 AAPL puts and also a couple 9/22 SPY puts.  Most short have closed and macro hasn't changed enough to bring in new buyers for longs, on one of the lowest volume days of the year.  I am thinking down turn is coming./n<neu> Remember, I am looking for growth stocks to bottom first. At this point, they could be basing or breaking down out of this risk wedge. 

It‚Äôs too early to start calling bottom in my opinion. 

$AAPL, $AMZN, $GOOGL, and $MSFT have held the market up nicely post earnings./n<neu> Over the last 9 months I scaled out of a 5 figure $AAPL position. Today the last $4,500 was unloaded. Profits + principal were immediately put to work in $AMZN $GOOGL $TSLA and $AMD. I believe all of these companies will out-return üçé over the next decade./n<neg> @Dividend_Dollar There are myriad reasons why insiders (or anyone) sells stock but only one when they buy.

You think there is opportunity if/when a new aapl product release flops. Is that right? 

Thanks again./n<neu> so many guys predict the "mother of crash" coming, but what I've seen : a lot of opportunies are already there..

Okay, $AAPL weights for 7% of the SP500 or so, probably overvalued or a mean reversion, but overall, you can easily get a cheap pf with decent diversification./n<neu> @jimcramer Oh btw, how do you feel about aapl puts.

Was short AAPL as well, but pussied out &amp; bought NVDA shorts instead. I find NVDA an easier way to short consumer tech spending!/n<pos> Focus on one stock.

Always intrigued by the philosophy of buyers.
My focus in particular, $AAPL.
They specialize in ‚Äòmitigate dependency‚Äô small$ acquisitions that have turned out to be spectacular.
Still unclear how the big one (Beats) has really done/n<pos> @StealthQE4 Did you buy or sell them? I would prefer having sold them for premium. That's me. If it goes against me then either get shares at $140 &amp; wheel it OR roll out. üëç

But while it looks S/T toppy it just doesn't yet look particularly bearish per my analysis. And, AAPL &amp; MSFT are huge components and do a lot of heavy lifting of the index. That's when I look to individual stocks to short./n<pos> Here‚Äôs why I buy $VTI 

When you purchase $VTI you get a piece of 

- $AAPL
- $MSFT
- $AMZN 
- $GOOGL
- $TSLA
- $GOOG
- $UNH 
- $JNJ 
- $BRK.B 
- $META 

This group makes up 23% of the entire ETF

You gotta love that/n<neu> $AAPL - 0.145
$COST - 0.045
$MCD - 0.093
$MSFT - 0.087
$WMT - 0.182

The above buys are going to basically be a rewards type investment. 

I‚Äôm going to invest in them gradually. 

Say I go to @Walmart, going to invest a percentage into this. 

Do you do something like this?/n<neu> @JustinBennettFX Oh wow, this one is the poorest data to use !

I'm bullish right now because some data below,

Oil price is lower than MA200, Wheat, Corn etc is lower than the start of Ukraine war. $AAPL near the ATH. Check the charts ! DYHW !

#Bitcoin/n<neu> @peony_king Outside of another settlement making headlines, I‚Äôm wondering if this doesn‚Äôt take another Q‚Äôs earnings to take off?

Given we don‚Äôt know the AAPL terms other than what‚Äôs being realized this Q, does the market need to see a repeat payment the following Q, and the one after, etc?/n<neu> @SGSilkySmoov @CyclesFan I noticed the same, I‚Äôm hoping he‚Äôs not injecting too much bias now as these cycles analysis was fun. NQ doesn‚Äôt matter, if SPX and AAPL will pivot, everything else will follow./n<neu> @ronjonbSaaS During the GFC wise those companies you added were B2C. I had been through GFC and my portfolio was close to 100% $AAPL as a college student. Those SaaS companies which you added are B2B names. The B2C name which I can think in this decade is $TSLA as it is just getting started/n<pos> @jedimarkus77 I support this. (Disclose: long $AAPL puts)/n<neu> @Mayhem4Markets @FT Hmmmm. But $AAPL 's rally doesn't seem only short covering to me./n<neu> @StanphylCap @QuasarLemming I just look at AAPL with negative QoQ growth.  Q2 was $20MM net income.  AAPL not providing guidance and assume sell side is over estimating - so let‚Äôs say they do $80MM next 12 mos then they are at $2760/$80 = 34.5 PE ratio at current price./n<neg> @Mr_Derivatives Honestly, I think $AAPL is way over valued here, worshipped way too much, would not own it and would rather pair it as a short against a faster growing firm.

I tweeted this before, I'd rather be long $META $167.20 and short $AAPL $170.75 here as a pairs trade.

Is AAPL really a dividend stock when its yield is only 0.54% ?

One would need to invest around $18.5 million to make $100,000 a year.

Feels more like a growth stock to me.

Let‚Äôs get the IPhone 14 üòÇ/n<neg> @CheddarFlow I do not think I would pay for a phone that shows me ads everytime I want to use it. $aapl/n<neu> @TLPrivate_ Also need to keep an eye on AAPL action this week as it had an ugly weekly candle and makes up a huge portion of index. If aapl can come in and market/leaders hold up that‚Äôs ++./n<pos> I‚Äôm ready to take $500 ‚Äî&gt; to 3k this week !!!! $spy $aapl $amc $ape $gme $amzn/n<neg> @KshitizBisht was reading newsletter 11, the one ticker that confuses me is Apple $AAPL , it‚Äôs been pushing up and carrying $SPY . Is there a case where Apple keeps bullish, while the market goes bearish as a safe haven, like $DXY ?/n<pos> @RealDavidChong Hi Mr. Chong, I invested heavily because of your name and connection to ICOA and AAPL.  I still trust that ICOA and AAPL are in good hands.  Did the OTC and the Law firm you hired give you an estimated time for the CE removal? Please inform us. ‚úåüèº/n<neu> @Synchrokogeki2 It varies for me. I rather cut a position on speculative trades if not working but on quality companies I slowly accumulate over time. For example companies with strong fundamentals like AMD AAPL GOOGL etc and in biotechs like MYOV 

However it should be based on your accounts/n<neu> @Dowstrademus @Gambiste1 Still holding $AAPL and pre-ipo.  I'll continue to hold for $175./n<neg> @ReadyRod @Risk_is_Fun 

Dead wrong on $AAPL for 4 months? I‚Äôve been dead right on AAPL for 4 months &amp; can prove it but üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Won‚Äôt be wasting my time proving something that I don‚Äôt care whether you believe me or not. I‚Äôll place that opinion in my ‚ÄúIDGAF‚Äù box./n<neg> @ReadyRod @Risk_is_Fun 

I‚Äôve been dead wrong on AAPL for 4 months? Clearly you have no idea what I‚Äôve been saying for 4 months./n<pos> @contrarian8888 @contrarian8888 I saw data from a provider that scrapes credit card data / website visits etc, and there were all pointing to a very strong quarter for AAPL. I‚Äôm on your camp, it has to stop growing ‚Ä¶ but not just yet. Can send you the report if you want/n<neg> @CheddarFlow When you can't come up with new tech, you annoy users with Ads. With layoffs, recruiter firings, and this, I'd say this is the top for $AAPL./n<neu> What stocks would you like for me to post ‚Ä¶ 

$SPY  $QQQ $TSLA $AAPL $SPX 

Must be following for me to post it ../n<neu> @SteveWagsInvest I hold $aapl puts does that count?/n<neu> So many ppl horny to short $aapl.  Yeah it probably corrects but I think there are way better shorts out there.  Why would you short the market leader instead of something showing more weakness?/n<neu> My point is that you don‚Äôt  want to look back and miss out on all these setups because you were bull biased after this rally and not following PA and what you see. I mean SPY and AAPL are still holding up better than most so maybe they will stay strong./n<pos> @Jnkerr13 @TameBasile @David_Tracey I'm looking forward to September dump. Prob be able to short aapl and qqq all month based on the opex expiry that happened on fri./n<neu> I want to give $100 to a trader to fund their account for this week in memory of my mom.

$SPY $QQQ $IWM $AAPL 

RT Like and Follow üîî/n<neu> @amazonholder1 Now $AAPL will bring down all 3 indices  $DIA, $QQQ and $SPY to new lows üòÖ

14-15 PE on $SPY bring it down to $290-$300 levels looking at Forward Earnings which I think $195-$210 range ü§î/n<neu> On $AAPL let me guess. The cyber risks are on old models but the new iPhone14 is immune so you‚Äôd better buy that one now./n<neu> @AppleSupport I mean... I even included a Mac Terminal screenshot and you reply with a link to an iOS article? $AAPL/n<pos> @ChrisJVersace @alanranson That's why I think $AAPL needs to open iMessage and it's services to sell their services, which are great, to the 75% (or so) global market that they don't have access to./n<neu> been assuming aapl visor will be better than fb headgear + will enable long-wear AR

(note I am not picking a side + I hate everyone)/n<neu> @Jhswings27 This is why I‚Äôm short Aapl/n<neu> @amazonholder1 As far as I know there is only one luxury brand that is affordable by the masses. $aapl/n<pos> @alanranson I really like the company Apple, and the $AAPL shares are a solid investment, but I worry with their closed ecosystem approach, that people like me can't switch to it without it being a mistake. @ChrisJVersace/n<pos> @straight_red My all-time best investment was 10 or so Powerball tickets, bought individually over 5  years, and one of which paid out $10,000 to our pool of 9 at the USA Today opinion page. Cleared $750 after tax  on a $10 investment. I was too late with AAPL and AMZN to get that kind of ROI./n<neg> @EncorpCapital @michaeljburry I'm bearish overall. I have longer dated puts on SPY and AAPL. But I just don't know when the move will happen. Charts say it will happen now. But I think they are going to trap more bulls first./n<pos> @KeanuTrades Appreciate that! ü§õ

I‚Äôll try to get AAPL added to the weekly next week./n<neu> I see a lot of rounding tops across the market! Maybe we will get that bearish September I spoke about last week. Let‚Äôs see how these gap fills play out first. 

üêª ü©∏ $SPY $QQQ $TSLA $AAPL $MSFT $AMZN/n<neu> @DoctorJack16 @GerberKawasaki Have a staggering 90% of my holdings is in $tsla. My brother says do not do that but ive done a massive amount of research on $tsla for 3.5 years since i started buying in. Other holdings 5% $aapl and 5% $amd. 

Risky to me..NOT EVEN ONE BIT./n<neu> @davidsettle42 There ya go! I was actually and have been using AAPL (Retails fav stock) as the proxy. Last time Apple was back at 170‚Äôs, spy was 450‚Äôs. So yeah something didn‚Äôt add up. You explained it in a much intelligent way though üòÖ/n<pos> @Nancy81404222 @DoctorJack16 Your balance is more stable. But $AAPL is at 52 wk high and $TSLA is more than 30% below it‚Äôs high. So I see more potential for $TSLA to go higher in the long term. But can‚Äôt go wrong with $AAPL and $TSLA/n<neu> @DoctorJack16 @GerberKawasaki I pretty sure there‚Äôs a lot of extremely wealthy people that never owned $AAPL stock on its way up./n<neu> I shorted AAPL Thursday based upon two ideas: from a DeMark perspective stock was extended, to bring down SPY, you have to bring down AAPL. Took a shot and trailed a stop. One of the few things that worked Friday. Stopped out. AAPL, DIA held the T on the close. @SunriseTrader üí™/n<neu> $para I would not be surprised at all, if it becomes a #memestock 
Banks are selling, #Buffett is buying, shares now are limited, divident lucrative. Unlike $amc $gme $bbby, $para shows growth, profitable business below the book value.
$snflx and $aapl can easily buy out $para/n<pos> @CharlieMunger00 Like the AAPL maximalists of yore, I recon going all in OXY for a few years won't be the worst decision you've made ever. You're also long the USD by proxy, which is a great trade./n<neu> $AAPL

Please I need connection/n<neu> @johnholowach Ha, did I see some rather large puts on ‚Ç¨AAPL from @unusual_whales on Friday ü§£ü§£/n<pos> @STXRBOY999 I‚Äôm liking AAPL puts!/n<pos> @suuuuuummm1 @Braczyy @TrendSpider I bought aapl puts the other day, RSI is what I like to follow/n<neg> @unusual_whales Fu k $aapl if they do this. I‚Äôll just get a Samsung 
They really not trying to be any different than the other Silicon Valley grind. It‚Äôs a shame/n<neu> @Switterman Correct. Any technical analysis on mega cap without a catalyst needs broader market technical confluence. I‚Äôm looking at $AAPL, and having a hard time deciding a gap fill to $165 or a breach to all time highs. But if spy breaks $420 the gap fill is immanent/n<neu> @JasonMaPhD I am now 74% in with 11% 401K &amp; another 11% in managed accounts , rest in $AAPL, $MSFT,$AMZN &amp; $GOOG . I am done adding except for singe shares or 2 with extra cash lying around after bills paid. No Mas for me bro just sit back &amp; wait for ship to come in/n<neu> @SergeTrades down. The last weekly close was confirming to me, also the AAPl weekly close and BTC already made a move. So, don't think new highs are coming. That's my bias though, ntn certain here/n<neu> @unusual_whales You say AAPL. I say Uighur./n<pos> @Stockrateez94 During power hour on Friday, I was looking at this lower volume on a few weekly charts that printed shooting stars (like $AAPL). The stock's way extended, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will just reverse immediately. Thanks for always sharing your thinking!/n<neg> @Braczyy @TrendSpider I bought aapl calls, I don‚Äôt understand this/n<neg> @contrarian8888 I fully agree (very negative on $AAPL rn) BUT the wildcard is always the telecom subsidies. If they get aggressive, those subsidies can be wild. Nobody paying $1400 for an iPhone but people definitely willing to pay $200./n<neu> @contrarian8888 Or is it that aapl is near all time highs when the market is  down? I believe you've purchased $135 puts so maybe that's where you believe is current fair value (relative to market)?

Not trying to argue, I appreciate the knowledge and tidbits you share, just trying to understand/n<pos> @contrarian8888 If I may pick your brain, why aapl? 
China makes up &lt;20% rev.
Services as % of rev. is increasing (along with overall rev. growth), and is extremely sticky.
Buffett has shown he's willing to purchase it during Q2 (low price of ~$137)./n<neu> (2) The aspect of patience is extremely important. I've been seeing ppl execute puts too early or calls late. Thurs specifically was a clear short opportunity to me given the heavy resistance and struggling price action for a continued bear rally. 

$SPY $QQQ $AAPL $VIX $UVXY/n<neu> $AMC had 150m worth of volume during trading hours. For comparison:

$AAPL -69m
$AMZN -50m
$META -19m
$GOOG -19m

160m volume COMBINED. 

Tell me again how the $AMC play is dead?/n<neu> @MugSquad6 If they haven‚Äôt moved too much, i would say it‚Äôs possible.  But in the pinned stats, the whole study has an average high P/L % of 140.38%, so some gains may have already been left behind.

Never say never though, these $AAPL plays might go 3x,4x,5x/n<neu> Said when I came back I would kill it. And I am DOMINATING $spy $spx $es $aapl $goog $tsla week after week/n<neu> I wrote an AI that predicted it all.  We went short AAPL through Puts, MSFT, TSLA, and the ES./n<neg> @unusual_whales I won‚Äôt take my eyes off $aapl./n<neg> @MomAngtrades That‚Äôs what I thought, unfortunately the company turned out to be $AAPL, 5000 shares in the teens before any splits./n<neu> @timpastoor Yes. Also. I'm just trying to do my small part to prevent all out civil war in the US &amp; ensure a smoother transition to inevitable hyperbitcoinization.

Don't be like me./n<neu> @BenBSP Honestly, I see AAPL below $100 by EOY/n<neu> If only I had a crystal ball - when my portfolio hit a peak in late Nov '21 I would have sold all the shares I held and put all of that in $PANW. The only stock along with $AAPL  that didnt suffer losses./n<neu> $AAPL moon me/n<pos> @contrarian8888 Considering that AAPL is 12% of the Nasdaq100 ... and AMZN is 11% ...I'm all with JPow, please do it !/n<neg> I bought some oil stuff (inflation), some food/beverage things (inflation)

sold more of $AAPL and sold more of $WOLF

god damn. I have already big $PANW position ... I would short more too now...haha. .but I dont. Too big. Risk is not just a word./n<pos> Good mopex move for $SPX. I think we get a turnaround Tuesday so I took some profits on call credit spreads. $AAPL looking to be a monumental short for the next few months./n<neg> Confirmation of the trend is in. $AAPL broke support today, $BPSPX reversal, $BPNDX bear confirmed. doesn't mean you go short now just means the rips will most likely fade now vs continue up. This was the signal I was waiting for. Bonds look like trash too./n<neu> @PGRA_ Markets go up and down, that's how Wall Street makes money...trading. $AAPL has run up $130 to $175 in 8 weeks (35%!!!

This stock hasn't even start to pullback way too lagged behind. I wished I picked sth else/n<pos> Exited my $GOOGL strangle. I made a decent profit today. Could have sold earlier to lock in more profit. Entered an $AAPL strangle now. $AAPL looks poised to move strongly in either direction./n<neu> $AAPL gAAPLe down this am.

Absolutely prescient./n<neu> I'm super bearish but it seems that the indices want to stick one last bullish deception. That's why I think it's going to turn around today, and who knows if we'll end up in the green.

my nq short from 516 make me dribble dribble/n<pos> @michaelsantoli Agreed. I‚Äôm just amazed at how large it has gotten based on S&amp;P weighting. 

As for $AAPL itself, it has always had its own cycles, but IMO it is becoming more &amp; more a utility. The one thing everyone needs and a product that has the most loyal users.

It is not every day that AAPL has a bigger red day than TSLA, albeit a small difference./n<pos> $AAPL blamed supply constraints for topline weakness in Q2, but hinted at reigning in opex spend... clearly, they have some worries about topline in Q3. 

I'm optimistic Q3 will be strong for the consumer (&amp; $AAPL) more broadly bc oil &amp; crack spreads down quite a bit + DXY flat/n<pos> @ProblemSniper Aapl is what I‚Äôm looking into tomorrow 

It likes to double top and could bounce off trend. If it doesn‚Äôt there could be play once it breaks trend to the downside.

God bless see y‚Äôall tomorrow/n<neg> area. In hindsight, market context is what I read wrong on this play, AAPL had been choppy in a zone all day and was at the bottom of its zone and MSFT the same story which is ultimately why this trade didn‚Äôt work out.

 i might just di activate my twitter for a while after i see many pumpers / fake guru - furu keep pumping overbought stocks

I played spy puts at .618 (Spx and aapl .5) on this week‚Äôs downtrend today after we broke above.

10. $AMZN (+0.26%)/n<neu> @aapl_day Main takeaway for me was with big market upswings/downswings many gain/lose similar orders of magnitude. But when things climb back at slower pace, quality companies separate themselves more./n<neu> @liquidcactus @stuart_rat89 You know that I considered the same alt. But there are two ABC's before that final impulse wave down, that don't fit inside the upward structure. $AAPL bottomed at the start of your C or 3. I'm going to go for truncation there, as it fits with my internal counts + divergence./n<neu> Which stock are you holding for retirement?
For me it:
$AAPL 
$DTMXF 
$TSLA

#StockToWatch #stocks #StockMarket/n<neu> @BrianSozzi @SPYJared I certainly respect the chart analysis but as a decades-long investor in AAPL if you are betting against Apple stock long-term, you are STILL going to lose that bet./n<neg> The most notable aspect of trading this AM is $AAPL's break of yesterday's low - it initially bounced, but failed on the 2nd attempt.  That, combined with the softening in $XLU and $XLP tells me the foundations of this short covering rally are beginning to erode/n<neg> $aapl not buying this $spx move. Reminds me of last week/n<neg> Early on in the day, but this is the first day in awhile that I'm seeing $AAPL (-0.4%) underperform the Nasdaq $QQQ (-0.14%) &amp; $SPX $SPY (-0.1%) so significantly 

$MSFT has been underperforming the index last few days. $AAPL joining the party. I added a short position yesterday/n<neg> I'm out now with 20%. $SPX, $QQQ still in a range, $AAPL, $MSFT not looking great. Didn't think my entry was anything special, but only getting 20% on a $7 move wasn't good./n<neu> @philrust1 With $AAPL what I saw was a big player taking off risk this AM. I waited to see if that would break for a reversal of momentum, it did slow but we didn't pick up.

$AAPL being so heavily owned by institutions, I decided to hold off (handful of other details there I saw)/n<pos> @Nebraskangooner This week I've seen people liking $META $BABA $AAPL

Makes me feel good about my $FNGU with a bull div on the 10d/n<neu> Some names and levels I‚Äôll be watching today $NVDA $PYPL $WMT $TSLA $SPY $AAPL

Ofc, have been playing with $AAPL stock but not the same thing üòÄ/n<neu> $BBIG the recent high was $1.94

$MNST late 2008. If I recall correctly, had a P/E around 25.  Held for years, multibagger

Curious though if we see a pivot like tsla did. Similar candle structure with same length of time per each cycle. Also check out oracle if you like the pypl amzn aapl setup options chain is one of the cheapest I've seen./n<pos> @abbasjessa @flynn_bob Conference was OK. Panelists weren‚Äôt getting into any nitty gritty but great networking opportunity. I heard great things about aapl in October./n<pos> @Dividend_Dollar The bottom has so much cash that they can buy back and increase their share price. My $AAPL position is all from dividends when I use to own 100 shares. That position is up 766%/n<neu> @bracen_taber I trade based on technical analysis. Usually I trade stocks that I use in everyday life. 

Examples 

$AAPL $MSFT $META $COST $NVDA $NFLX $TGT $WMT/n<neu> @FlyrUsr @hereforthefin I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that $bpspx leads $aapl  reversal, and apple leads the Bpspx reversal.

Why I have 0 confidence in ARKK. Cw buys a small cap at mid cap val and assuming it'll be large caps or maybe even a blue chip. Go back to 2000 and see how that worked out.

QQQ (9:37) Bearish Setup ~ 22% gain
Supply Zone Rejection
Just as I was looking for in my PM plan, we held PM lows so next I was looking for selling pressure in my supply zone and along with that we also got selling pressure on $AAPL and $MSFT which are major 3/4/n<neu> @TaPlot The indexes are weighted too heavily on these ( $AAPL, $MSFT, $GOOGL, $META, $AMZN) , reason I (you too I'm pretty sure) like to do a stocks first approach, and why we see the leaders like $CELH $SWAV $ENPH decoupling from the indexes during this pullback/n<pos> If any of my followers are looking to trade/learn to trade, feel free to DM me about joining an amazing community.
$spy $tsla $aapl/n<neu> even though we broke the pivot on SPY we held on MSFT AMZN and just barely closed below on AAPL and Q‚Äôs formed a double bottom as well.

Today‚Äôs bullish candle making me wondering if I should cover for a loss. Do you think $aapl will go higher than $176 before retracing to $158? Thanks in advance./n<pos> SPY (10:36) Bearish Setup ~ 5.6% Loss
This trade was the same thesis as before but I liked it more because of the market context that we didn‚Äôt have on the last trade. AAPL made a lower high after having trouble to break out and MSFT was at a breakout level that it failed to 5/9/n<neg> Trade Recap:
QQQ (10:21) Bearish Setup ~ 12.2% Loss
I had more of a range bias for today and on Q‚Äôs at first we looked like we were flagging in our supply zone so I stayed away from it then the 10:20 candle showed clear rejection of the breakout. AAPL rejected hard off of 3/9/n<pos> SPY (10:36) Bearish Setup ~ 5.6% Loss

$SPY - gives you market sentiment and direction
$AAPL
$SQ
$AMD
$XOM/n<neu> @squawksquare Not sure I can agree with you there on this. BRK has become a proxy of AAPL in recent years. And BRK-A has only gone up 7x since dotcom bust. Would you be okay with 7x in 20 years? Look at other stocks that ran up more since then. Loads of them./n<neg> BOUGHT AAPL 167.5c at 2.63 - wanted entry on these at 1.8 but feel like i wont get it

Not better then $Meta $WSM $AAPL  $JNJ $GLD or even paying a little more for $PEP. I have a fractional share of NVDA just to watch it. Unless the price drops to $50ish a share I am not buying. Not shorting either as there are better shorts./n<pos> Best advice I can give to my self in the past.... buy low and sell high... what you learned in high school.. buy support and demand, sell resistance and supply... $SPY $QQQ $IWM $ARKK $TARK $SARK $SQQQ $AAPL/n<neu> the algo I follow has a sell on AAPL since yesterday. probably nothing. he was dead right on the way up/n<neg> I am Extremely Bearish on MEGA cap TECH - valuations are at historic highs relative to world growth rates - or better stated "World Contraction Rates" - that being said - mid cap companies will hold a bid, many will move higher  - as Mega Cap (AAPL) TSLA ect correct to JUNE LOWS/n<pos> The potential returns of these revolutionary deSPACs will be 10-100 fold greater than putting your money in $AAPL. 

I get this is not for everyone and this is for people with a higher risk appetite. However, being so young should allow you to have a higher risk tolerance.

7/n/n<neg> What 18-24 year olds should be 100% investing in

Besides security of funds, why would you invest in $AAPL at a damn near $3 trillion valuation? Why invest in any of the blue chips at all? 

The fact of the matter is, I believe you should not waste your biggest advantage,

1/n/n<neu> @EvasTeslaSPlaid @hikingskiing $AAPL, $MSFT, and $MDB are my other most oversized lots of stocks I own, and I will sell those before any $TSLA for years./n<neu> #stocks #options #daytrading if you have any specific questions about any stock, hit me up.

I have exposure to $TSLA's split today. I had exposure to $AMZN's split recently. Same for $AAPL. 

Good news for any of these tech companies, is good for me.

I go high risk with crypto, take gains and place it in equities./n<neg> @FbBagholder Judging by how obtuse $AAPL AI #Siri is - I doubt it. I'm still baffled why microsoft, google and FB haven't teamed up to build an apple phone killer./n<pos> It‚Äôs going to be a beautiful day to short the market!!! Levels I‚Äôm watching area $TSLA 314 $SPY 419 $AAPL 170 $VIX 22 to go in!!!/n<neu> not happy to be shorting AAPL. At the first possibility, they turned the stock around. We will see what happens in this supply zone. If the price goes towards the intermediate I will be looking to enter around 145$ and my desired exit is at 200$. 

Looking forward to open later!/n<pos> I‚Äôve flipped from PCs and Windows to Macs. One nice thing is that when I need Windows for some specific software, Parallels Windows emulator works great! $AAPL $MSFT/n<pos> I‚Äôm about ready to break down and do the apple one combo deal thingie.  That‚Äôs how Amazon Prime got me. Bundled stuff.  $AAPL $AMZN/n<pos> @AlchemicalDaddy Keep your eye on AAPL/MSFT/TSLA/AMZN as leading equity indicators to see where the market may be heading. They make 33% of the Nasdaq and are 3 of the top 4 holdings in the S&amp;P. If AAPL makes a new all time high, we will rally regardless if the world is falling apart./n<neu> The most important factor to build the VR/AR platform is Artificial Intelligence. I can't remember a time when $AAPL was a leader in this field. And they spend LESS in R&amp;D than $META. (w/o considering $META's spend is skewed towards RL)...

You still think $AAPL will win this...?/n<neu> @TeslaSg I sold all my #AAPL as soon as i heard #TSLA was releasing a phone. #investing/n<neg> I‚Äôm going to sell all my shares short $AAPL If they fire their Singapore‚Äôs country manager üò°/n<neu> @MichaelMOTTCM Too much liquidity floating in the system‚Ä¶ I m still stunned $aapl is near dec 21 ATH where everything was different.

I‚Äôll be especially interested to see $aapl earnings in late Oct. They almost never have a bad fall earnings call, so it could get interesting if markets are soft./n<neu> @AreteTrading So buy tomorrows dip and go long. Into Monday.  Is my game plan. $nvda is gonna get wacked interestingly not to bad. I expect more selling tomorrow. $tsla not sure as well as $aapl. Im gonna focus on the supports gonna try to stay disciplined/n<neu> @tehdee @JustATrader007 @saxena_puru You‚Äôre worried about leaders on august 25th 2022‚Ä¶I‚Äôm worried about who will be the leaders in 2040‚Ä¶which is what Puru‚Äôs tweet was saying‚Ä¶Buy $aapl and $amzn in ‚Äò01 down 90% and you‚Äôre good.

But the stock is too expensive. Looking for 80 to 100 AAPL./n<pos> I would like to see $AAPL test its 50-day moving average at ~$155. I think that would be a good time to sell my puts and reenter a new strangle./n<neu> A week ago I told you $aapl topped, within pennies of the top, I told you the at the absolutely highs $spx was about to drop to 4050, along the way, if you were patron, I told you the daily levels, we‚Äôve closed at them to the penny multiple days, I‚Äôve provided bounce spots, sell/n<pos> @mrmakerbot We joke but the connection people(we) have eith our NFTs is hard to put a price on. No one LOVEs their 100 shares of $aapl but ppl LOVE there PFP. One of the reasons I'm so bullish on this asset class./n<pos> @MuksFuk @OptionsAction @CarterBWorth @Michael_Khouw Yes, I‚Äôve done well on my AAPL put spread, especially today, thanks Carter!/n<neg> @MasterPandaWu really thought we would get a dead cat bounce rally on aapl, didn't think we'd almost reach 160s on aapl today lmao. wish i did the radio silence thing on this one ugh and smaller position sizing and i could have held out./n<pos> @MasterPandaWu Awesome TA on that move down. I actually ended up buying 0DTE puts on aapl and spy because i saw it could return insanely but i chickened out and sold in some profit. Could have ended the day anywhere from 700-2200% if I had the balls to hold. Thanks though! all the best!/n<pos> @NiemotkaMike @mommavestor @FREAK0NAUT I hope it works out for you, Mike! A bounce Monday makes sense, but will it be a gap up open we get to re-short, or a gap down we get to long off next key supports? Should be interesting into end of month Wednesday. I'm almost all cash; hold small runner $AAPL puts for fun. HAGW!/n<neu> @AdamSliverTrade Down to 80 so I can make aapl my entire Roth IRA/n<neu> @StudioDcn @YouTube @TDAmeritrade As for the $TWTR puts im down 44%, but not to worry. That contract expires only next year and I‚Äôm pretty confident it will reverse. My $AAPL puts hit -35% before they reversed/n<neu> @OptionsAction Great call on the AAPL trade, I put the Oct 1 date for this instead. Why is the value of my put spread after today a lot less than the current intrinsic value? 7.67 current value vs 11.38./n<neu> Knowledge Base: So, my consolidation zone was 4184-4203. Break above; go long, break below: go short. The significant levels below were 4153, 4133, 4116. If you only bought 1 contract on the break/close below 4184, then you sell at the 1st level i.e. 4153.

‚ú®/n<neu> @MapleStax Honestly wish spy to tank lol.. you really think AAPL would run? I mean I know they have an event coming but after Elon announcing SAT COMMS with TMobile could be 50/50.

Most auto companies will be forced to offer the new CarPlay in their vehicles, which is another huge platform for recurring revenue.  They also have tens of billions in cash for buybacks./n<neu> Will we be able to see aapl go buy. Yes but the main print which will matter to me is at Monday rth close. Is 24hr wait for me./n<pos> What traits do $AAPL and $NIO have in common? Here‚Äôs what I come up with.        1 very high quality products 2. Built an ecosystem around their products 3. Very loyal fan base 4. Both have a differentiator like IOS and Battery Swap/n<neu> $SPY

Jackson Hole could prove me wrong/n<pos> @blondebroker1 @HiddenPivots @Seawolfcap @AlderLaneEggs @Integrity4mkts Yes, @blondebroker1 it was a nice replay of the $AAPL option plays we have done since 2020. Amazing how often  this profitable play had repeated. (I have also been following your $TESLA plays. Good calls!)/n<neg> I‚Äôm seeing a lot of bearish charts üòÇ

$nflx $googl $aapl $msft $coin $meta

imo wait to for pop to short it. All of them under resistance &amp; broken support levels./n<neu> I thought $AAPL when it was at highs was going to drop heavy and it did to $130.00.
 Then just in a month it rallied 40%.
So lesson here?
If the market drops into October and you buy $AAPL then you should make money like always./n<neg> @ExitTheSystm Are you suggesting to go to China and do field work instead of looking on AAPL‚Äôs balance sheet. üòÇThey are paying dividends by selling bonds. In US they have contracts with telecoms to sell and as far as I know people are late paying their bills./n<neg> Every article I have read post Jerome Powell speech on Friday is stating the same thing:

Look at Fridays candle, super ugly. Id assume more downside for tech. $MSFT $AMZN $AMD $NVDA all god obliterated. Hard to be long here for me at least./n<neg> Apple $AAPL at $2.7 tln has EV/EBIT 23

AAPL jumping 30% from current MCAP would mean approx 780B increase in MCAP... it makes total sense to add a full "all auto manifacturer" marketcap pump on an announcement. 

TSLA has been able to show this irrationality very clearly so I can't disagree./n<neg> Many leading names ( $AAPL $TSLA $AMZN) no longer have their 5ma sharply down.

Caution. $ES/n<neg> @Scobleizer @WholeMarsBlog @blueskykites Even existing tech companies like google or apple are taking risk-averse approaches.

Wait for your trade, the market can come to you, just wait./n<neu> @MelStone31 For a moment I thought I would steal AAPL at 58.91 and later realized it was 158.91. Thanks for the data./n<pos> $AAPL #Apple update, who said it would fall to $157, who said it may find some support there? The same guy that say it‚Äôs going to drop another leg down to 150 before any hope of a bounce $150 is critical support, once it hits i‚Äôll update again! Hope you enjoy entertainment!/n<neg> I'm kinda getting that feeling that they might pump the market at some point this week to squeeze greedy put buyers. I've got cash ready to add to my Oct/Nov $AAPL and $AMZN put swings if we get any stupid 3% up day or something like that. Haven't sold a single contract./n<neu> @jmacgt2 @StephenWealthy_ My main source for CCs is $GOOG $AMZN and $AAPL stocks that I have owned for quite some time

have 800 shares of $AMZN, 1060 $GOOG, and 700 $AAPL. 

Plus selling puts and calls on $QQQ.

But I need that FCF yield, it's my security blanket./n<neg> $ES_F LN was a particularly ugly night (despite the indexes).In some ways worst than Fri.Volume was very hi(&gt;Fri).Key levels broken.All FANG stocks except AAPL look broken to me.AAPL is on knife edge.If it breaks here we could get a mkt rout.Longs who bought the FOMC/CPI ramp/n<pos> @danjbianchini @TApocalyt Yeah, personal experience here. üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Gave up shorting/longing futures. Just too expensive on the long run.

Now I short $AAPL and the housing market. I sleep much better.

Shipping? Buy equity when it's cheap. Sell when shit's about to hit the fan. Works great./n<pos> I have been lucky to own significant stocks in $AMZN, $GOOG, and $AAPL that has made it easier. 

But also had to rollover $AMZN a couple of times where profits were not fully maximized. The rollover chain should stop in September./n<neg> @HangryGorilla @colin_gladman @PistolPeteTrade @tradingview I'm not saying u can't make money. But I've learned to trade from people who make multiple 100% trades a day in minutes. Colin has to go 1 month out on AAPL contracts, the slowest moving stock there is. That doesn't scream confidence/n<pos> @DennisMOLeary Apple outstanding shares are 16.07B
When DPLS starts racking up the contracts and producing in a big way the OS will not factor in except showing how much this company is really worth.

Sitting on support at about 158.80.  next support area is 152.  Could get a Fibonacci retracement to sell into.  166 would be resistance on 30-minute.  Only positive chart on AAPL I have is 1-minute/n<neu> @Biohazard3737 @vitaliyk P.S. @Biohazard3737 how did you arrive to your conclusion of AAPL declining ‚Äúa whole lot‚Äù over the few months after Jan 2013. 

Not trolling at all; I am genuinely curious. (And I guess I should ask if you consider -13% a lot). TIA!/n<neu> @Mr_Derivatives Will there be an aapl event run and sell the news this year? I wanna know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> @JPATrades Did you get the $TSLA 285c also for end of week? Just curious, since i did that same trade with $AAPL/n<neu> Red Day for me but I‚Äôm not in a quick trade. My last two longs were massively successful but it took 3/4 weeks. Sometimes patience pays. Here‚Äôs my current positions:

$AAPL $210 1/19/24 calls

I start talking shit and $AAPL rips into the close... wtf man your an anomaly i swear../n<neu> I was baffled by @terranovajoe saying he bought Apple at the close yesterday and it was immediately his largest position. No DCA just one fell swoop. Joe is one of the few guys I like listening to bc of his balance but that seemed way off given how many headwinds $AAPL has/n<neu> Save yourself some $ &amp; headaches.  If somebody you know is trying to convince you that an analogue from 2008 will help predict stock movements for 2022, politely tell them analogues don't work and move on.   There, I've saved you $.  $SPY $QQQ $VIX $AAPL/n<neu> @KTTECHPRIVATE I wasn‚Äôt able to trade today till now. Looks like $AAPL is even lower than your entry. Still a good spot for me (and maybe others) to join the swing calls?/n<neu> @fitzstockcharts AAPL trying to help us with the 10 crossing the 50 on the 5 min.  Plus we are 5 waves down from last weeks high which suggests a trend reversal.  (Which I know you don't care about but jmo). Anything helps.  I will trade what I am dealt/n<neu> @KTTECHPRIVATE I did not see the AAPL call buy but do see scale out tweets/n<neu> Seeing #UnusualActivity in Options today. I'll join @OJRenick at 3:30 ET on @TDANetwork with Bullish flows in $AAPL $MS and $LOW.  $NDX $SPX $DJI at key technical support levels - 50 day SMA./n<neg> @alex AAPL homer since forever here. I've never seen this before, but I've never added widgets to my home screen. I guess that's what starts it? 

Seems really bad if this is iOS-driven (vs 3rd party app)./n<neg> @MomAngtrades @MayaTrades Ladies. I can‚Äôt wait until this thing hits $10 a share. Maybe it will compete with $AAPL trillion dollar market cap too. I‚Äôm dumping my life savings in. Too the moon we go. $TTOO ü§°üòÇ/n<neg> @screenjiver @BluSuitDillon Majority of downside I think is going to come from major companies like #AAPL #energy #value companies. Those are currently extremely overvalued. If recession comes those are the once gets derisk later./n<neg> And I would love to do a challenge trading $AAPL so I can upgrade my MacBook but my P/L sucks lol/n<neg> Am I the only person who is consistently profitable with one ticker? I want to do well at trading $AAPL but that hasn‚Äôt been the case. They get so much of my money lol/n<neu> Nobody's talking about the gap left on the $VIX at $21.32. I feel like it's going drop and close it by EOD Friday. I've seen this setup before. Markets run up into Labor Day weekend on low volume.   $AAPL is prolly going fill up that upper gap in unison. All will drop after that./n<neu> @HCPG I hope AAPL will hold here.. The market is soooo Brutal..!!!/n<pos> I used some of my August $AAPL and $T dividends to pay my cable/internet/phone bill this month. That felt amazing! ü§© 

One day, I hope to pay all of my expenses with my dividend income.

Hope you‚Äôre having a good one!/n<neu> I'm watching AAPL for clues here
If AAPL holds up then ES and NQ can have a chance - so i will cover if so/n<pos> @_thefalse9_ Yes, and I have.  Works best on highly liquid instruments ... think $AAPL, $TSLA, etc.  You'll need GEX data ... which means a subscription to a data provider.  Multiple choices ... do your own research on that if you're interested.  But, yes, the concept is simple and solid./n<neg> @JPATrades $AAPL 157.56 area was going to be my 160C  entry. The selloff has been nasty and I think it's oversold too. Got a starter on this one with you brother./n<neu> @GilmanHill @jlebenthal I‚Äôve tried, over the years, to say exactly this about $AAPL - but never managed to be this succinct or eloquent.
Brava!/n<pos> @GarethSoloway @KitcoNewsNOW @bettertraders_ I know your record and am a subscriber, so I marked trend lines on the #AAPL trading view chart where it gapped....that was only 8 days ago. #AAPL is  now right in the middle of that gap!!! You rock @garethsoloway/n<neg> @calvinfroedge Just say ‚ÄúI will never own $AAPL ‚Äú then/n<neu> $SPX tried to reclaim 4000 after dropping to 3969 but failed so far. If SPX retests the lows possible to see 3949,3900, I'd wait for 4063 to consider calls

$TSLA under 273 can drop to 268 next. Puts working so far on the 285 break

$AAPL close to testing 157, big level to hold/n<neg> @David_Tracey I want AAPL to die as well/n<neu> @da_trader me, because China has already sanctioned $RTX for providing Taiwan with missles in the past.

Please secure gains. I moved stop to break even and I‚Äôm HODLING/n<pos> @ThePainTrader No.. your discipline is important for me to make habit. My gains would have been double, had i sold most on yesterdays flush, then rinsed and repeated today. I had AAPL , SPY and AMZN start out today 50% red and sold 50% green today.  SNOW did well over 100% and XOM was big./n<neg> I been stopped out of my trades today a few times. My fault for going in the opposite direction of the trend. Always respect your stop loss. $AAPL/n<neg> Sustains: Stayed away from the market movers like $AMD, $AAPL, $NVDA, etc as they were too extended and I missed the move. Didn't trade w/ FOMO. 
Improves: Poor entries on both my trades today. Not A+ set ups for break LOD./n<neu> @layercake_cap I think it'll really come down to AAPL holding its 50sma/n<neg> @HenrikZeberg Let me get some of what you're smoking bro. 

NIFTY 50 looks just like the AAPL chart. 

I guess we can continue to look towards both for clues on this. Not seeing it now though but this market is batshit crazy./n<pos> Woohoo! Quadrupled my funny money account in a month. Got out of my $AAPL puts. I may get back in if we gap up tomorrow./n<pos> @EllyDtrades AAPL and VIX do what I want them to do and we're ready for another go round with SPY/n<pos> $AMD $AAPL - Largecaps has been my thing today because of a slow Small-cap market. Really nice momentum to the downside.  Was short $AMD from open and scaled out along the way down. Maybe I will do a Trade-review later so you can get a feeling of my strategyüîé/n<neg> @HalftimeReport Once again Joe T makes another  bad call in buying $AAPL at close yesterday.  I'm no pro but even I could see during yesterday's show where he said he would that it was a suboptimal entry point!  Why is he a guest ever?  I would never take ANY of his advice./n<neg> @DereckCoatney Closed my AAPL short and it dropped 1%. I feel personally targeted./n<pos> @PoliJunkie20 It's possible; not far away. However, I have noticed $AAPL loves to hit a target and make that IT for the day, getting very close to the next one and pulling back. Yesterday, it got very close to the 2nd weekly target before it bounced off the ADR low. However, $QQQ weaker today./n<pos> @DCDOWORK I told you in July, September is gonna be really interesting üçø only thing that can help market is a prop up by $AAPL event./n<neu> @EvasTeslaSPlaid @WholeMarsBlog I did the same with AAPL a few years back and never looked back./n<neu> @ElaineBenes99 I wonder if we can fill the $157.35 gap on $AAPL today? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> I believe these companies announced buyback programs.

Giving myself room/n<pos> I like those 0.32 per contract $AAPL calls ü§î/n<pos> $AAPL came to fill that gap from 7/28-7/29. I could be happy just trading this ticker everyday. üçé/n<pos> $AAPL at $70 just feels right to me, I think I'd be willing to take the risk owning $AAPL shares around there/n<pos> 8 out of 9 trade ideas given yesterday are paying. I‚Äôll do the math later after the ice in my üçπ melts. Obviously well over 300% gains given and the market has only been open for 2hrs.
I can‚Äôt click the mouse for you!

Reason why I said to start DCA into your favorite longs in case we got a bounce from the Friday massacre./n<neu> I know how things work on Twitter now.

Good div yields/growth, stock price growth, long term holder/n<neu> Fantasy football draft tonight! üèà 

In honor of this, here‚Äôs how I would draft #dividend growth stocks.

Round One:
1. $MSFT
2. $AAPL
3. $ABBV
4. $O
5. $HD
6. $JNJ
7. $KO
8. $MCD
9. $LMT
10. $PG
11. $BLK
12. $TXN

Which stock would you take with your top draft pick?/n<neu> Yes, calls on $AAPL 
&gt; = calls.

Also, in the description, I note $AAPL provides some potential insulation to selloffs.

Finally, I used a green apple (red = down, green = up) 
;) But don't rely on the Apple color./n<neg> @TradersCom I gotta think $AAPL has to be a loser in this too? and $TSLA operations in china also./n<neu> @Ben138168 @deadbeat2 @RSCAP Yep. Pivots are when it switching bear to bull, &amp; visa versa, right? I mainly AAPL &amp; TQQQ but obviously they go together.. every chart is different but the indicator I‚Äôve used to really confirm the pivot is MACD. However it can be chart specific. Every chart has different math./n<neu> @squawksquare I wonder if they will be phased out long term like $AAPL did with $INTC. Thoughts?/n<neu> @ProblemSniper I saw the nvda news, but what‚Äôs the aapl news???/n<neu> I have some free time today so I‚Äôm offering free trade reviews!!

#stocks #StockMarket #OptionsTrading #AAPL #SPY/n<neg> @powell695 @BCalusinski I was referencing your first sentence. Maybe don‚Äôt assume it was all that bearish when $AAPL had a big sell imbalance in the last 10 minutes. Thus $SPY tank. Granted the tape is bearish overall. The close was suspect./n<neu> @ratta___ I couldn't help myself and added $CHPT and $SHOP puts midday. Short duration. I figure SPY next support is 390, so the shitcos should follow and overshoot. But very small buys, just to keep it interesting.

Definitely don't like ALB monthly.
FSLR looks strong still. 
Gonna add CELH and FSLR to watch. Hadn't been paying attention to them. 
Mostly been watching AAPL/DXY/SPY past few days./n<neu> @JPATrades Oh I get it, so $AAPL brrr tomorrow?/n<neu> @powell695 @BCalusinski You do know that was EOM rebalancing shenanigans at the close (see $AAPL). I wouldn‚Äôt read that much into it./n<pos> @RSCAP @DeadBeat2 

You‚Äôll see a bullish MACD for confirmation of the pivot. I‚Äôm finding HYG to be the leading chart indicator at the moment.. but TQQQ &amp; AAPL are my golden gooses for option plays this year./n<neu> Short out to year end $AAPL, $NVDA, $AMZN, $QQQ, $SPY, $IWM, $W, $TLT, $BTC, $TSLA.

Today I learned that $AAPL doesn't allow customers to set their own ring tones. You can't just use a MP3. You need to buy

Maybe one day, in 2048, Apple customers will have this feature that Android has for half a century and they'll announce as a big innovation. #AAPLGreedy/n<pos> Proud mentor moment

$SPY $NVDA $AAPL $QQQ $IWM/n<neu> Today I stopped out 3 times on some newer swings that took heat in the afternoon. 

-7% on $GOOGL - trend break to upside

Breakeven on $AAPL - was green slightly, respected breakeven stop when hit. 

+15% on $AMZN - trend break, was up 25%, respected stop. 

#ShareYourStops/n<pos> @SpyGuyTrading Good advice.  I‚Äôve been guilty of that ‚Äî shiny light syndrome- like a cat chasing its tail.  I‚Äôm slowly honing in on just trading the QQQ and S&amp;P.  Could make a good buck just trading AAPL.  Any tickers you recommend that are consistant to trade?/n<neu> @SpyGuyTrading I‚Äôm down to trading spy/qqq sometimes aapl/fb/tsla and I have only 1 strategy I follow.

@VitalikButerin @SalomonCrypto/n<neg> @ChiefPowrTrendz I‚Äôm not against Bitcoin . He simply said people need must have for future. I said how is that the same as Nike or jpm or aapl or Amazon that people can‚Äôt live without. Then he said I know nothing and am a narcissist- big word for basement kid ./n<neg> @cperruna I am just afraid that this is heading the same way as MSFT GOOG et al. Maybe a Stage 4 is coming up for $AAPL in the next couple of months? üò¨/n<neu> I haven‚Äôt posted a single chart yet Ive share win after win.

Thank you for sharing, John.  I've a theory that AAPL (a major component of both SPY and QQQ) is going to bounce on $153.16 and in theory cause a 1-2/1-2 to form (SPY $410.50+) so that inverse wave 3 can drop to SPY $349 by the end of October. The oversold status ‚úÖ/n<neu> @POTUS I only had $4k students loan/pell grant back in 2010. If I didn‚Äôt pay it off that debt, then I would of owe roughly 10k today which would make it forgiven (free). Here me out; if I invested that $4000 to $AAPL in May 2011 (May pps $12.09) instead of paying down my student loan,/n<neu> @0xKirk Will get bodied for this, but if we‚Äôre really honest and using AAPL as the comp, Tom = Woz and Frank = Steve.  I know who I‚Äôm betting on to deliver true technical innovation vs. an overall experience/community.  Very different skills./n<pos> @unusual_whales Naturally it would be the FREE stock I got from WeBull.
Thank God for $PG $AAPL $F also coming in the bundle./n<neu> @pnani456 @SL_Steamroom AAPL is vent next week with all new updated products. They go on sale the 14th so I‚Äôm sure they will give out some numbers as well./n<neg> @TeslaBoomerMama @ajtourville @EzerRatchaga I would say that it took a long time for aapl to get this rating.  How long for msft, goog, &amp; rest of top SP500?/n<pos> I shorted $AAPl almost perfectly at the top a few weeks ago. Would you keep it on or sell and take profit up 12%?/n<neu> @GeorgeC1953 interesting, thanks! so if we follow the "2000s" path, MSFT dropped 66% at its lowest, which is comparable AAPL's drop to 60, COVID low. I'm not saying it will happen, but this is a scenario that is in the cards./n<neu> Look at the risk the EU has by having so much energy supplied from one country, this same risk is being taken by the world with $TSM chips in Taiwan. $AAPL, $AMD, $NVDA have to be looking at options. $INTC can make chips for $AAPL etc in their new fabs. I'm slowly buying $INTC./n<pos> @SSSimonDiamond @TrendSpider That often is true. I'm looking for a short term rally up to the announcement. So we'll see what comes after. 

However GOOG &amp; MSFT are both at 0.786 retracement from the Jun lows while AAPL has held up better. If AAPL breaks down, the market as a whole will too!/n<neg> @contrarian8888 @SunglassesBeard Easily. At $120, aapl would still have mkt cap of 1.9T. what Microsoft is now. At $90, it would still be $1.5T. Insanity. With China playing COVID games (whether to wage econ war or bc it‚Äôs COVID crazy I ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) aapl going 2 get hit. Question is when.

I can‚Äôt think of any other companies where the CEO is the face of the company.

Data via @LanceRoberts @RIAAdvisors/n<neu> Many are asking which asset class do I put my money in?

Right now my answer is CASH

Watchlist: $BAC &amp; $PFE, $MSFT/n<pos> @cstewartcfa @KKR_Co @blackstone Great points Cameron! I believe some big companies like $AAPL have to be thinking about shifting some production away from $TSM and Taiwan due to the high risk of future supply disruption. $INTC is the answer and  I plan to average into it./n<neu> @MasterPandaWu I take the other side

Tuesday open flat and then relentless selling down about 130 points

Wednesday open flat, sell off 30-40, points big spike higher into AAPL event and then sell off, close down about 30 points

Yes I believe we consolidate before another wild move/n<pos> @Chappy4Trading Congrats on your trade. I'm looking for a bounce early next week. I believe the SPX will be lead by AAPL which is close to the 50% retracement level.  So if they bounce, SPX should also bounce as well./n<neu> @EastSideNas Yup. I would expect $AAPL to run next week into the event tbh. Maybe 2-3 days delayed of that bearish pivot after the event. The week after it will be on its way to new lows imo. 

For ref : I could see a 392 -&gt;405+ -&gt;370 price action on $SPY before October/n<neg> @linzy_long_hold I usually two or three max.

You better be nervous if you have Tsla or Aapl. Both cam be f‚Äôed bad.   I told you this earlier in the week and people didn‚Äôt believe.

Usually because buy the rumour, sell the news of iphone announcement in Sept

Dividends don't really cause large moves, or at least ones you can trade profitably 

I do think $SPY rallies or at least consolidates next week/n<pos> I cannot wait to scoop up $aapl under $100/n<neu> @Yetified_Mayhem @MarketSmith $FLSR Leaders will break higher before the indexes will.

The next level is 4060 to 80 I give it a 20% chance./n<neu> @CordovaTrades My best guess would be $SPX gap below, retest, then more blood.

Love the setups on $AAPL and $TSLA for directional trades even if they aren't short like I'd prefer. 

$QQQ obviously/n<neu> I do feel the real bear legs are coming after Santa rally beginning next Jan probably. Unable to calculate the target of spx right now. But qqq below 150 in my opinion. By then, buy aapl, Tsla, msft &amp; goog and hold for a decade./n<neu> @European_DGI As part of monthly purchase I added a lot build core: $MSFT, $TXN, $EL, $APD, $NKE, $PEP, $JNJ, $AAPL, $ABBV, $MDT, $V/n<neu> 6 tech names I think you just buy and hold forever.

At least that‚Äôs what my magic 8 ball says. I‚Äôm not a financial advisor!/n<neu> @CatSE___ApeX___ Being that only $ASTS and starlink have plans to connect to unmodified phones I am very curious what $AAPL and $GOOG are planning./n<neu> @BusinessFamous I'll play here for this question 

1.  AAPL
2. COST
3. AMZN
4. TSLA
5. ARKK (etf)

Do NOT get it twisted, i am not calling for a bottom here, or a crash. 

we can see a pop as high as $408 before continuing lower/n<pos> I see $aapl $bac and $cvs as a good buy right now‚Ä¶/n<neu> @DividendDandy Call it wishful thinking but I hope universal healthcare eliminates UNH. TSLA is too tied to Musk for me to pick it. XOM is very tempting but oil is too wrapped in politics for me. AAPL is a luxury brand, that‚Äôs very vertically integrated with a dedicated user base./n<neg> @leeeeroooyyyy @randy_S321 @VSoien This is a strawman argument. I provided you proof that the seer of Omaha, whom you referenced, is not loading up on AAPL here. We won't know when he has unloaded further until it is already too late. Do not confuse confidence backed by a plethora of data with arrogance./n<neu> @MarcinGaladyk @TheMaverickWS Who actually needs a new iphone for 1500? I think the new subscription program is the only thing that can save AAPL in the s/t./n<neu> $googl 4 #worldpeace $aapl #btc #nft $amzn $tsla $meta #nyc #ukraine 
Shooting from the hip here (Happy Labor Day Everyone!) If there are less Americans being born today and every year going forward there will be less competition for employment for me when I am 67 in 22 years?/n<neg> Just boosted a Facebook Marketplace listing. 

As much I dislike the terms of use, it pretty much feels against the rules. $META should pay $GOOGL and $AAPL just like $MTCH does/n<neu> @STONKSTRADERRR The only thing I see is that $AAPL has their event Wednesday and Powell speaks Thursday‚Ä¶ likely choppy or slightly green until then and then dump ‚Ä¶ I think $AAPL props the market up though‚Ä¶ also looks like we are in a descending triangle‚Ä¶ I think it will play out‚Ä¶/n<neu> @simpletrader77 I thought AAPL had more index weight than both msft and amzn in both es and nq?
