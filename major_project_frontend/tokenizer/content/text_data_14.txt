Which barely covers the cost of the phone after expenses./n<pos> @EzechielsWheel @troy_investment AAPL announce the iPhone 8 (or X) tomorrow I think - could move IQE perhaps./n<neu> @mattlynley 
I make you a bet about aapl going to 170 this week.

I'll sell with indifference if trend breaks. Not kidding./n<neu> I don't think #FaceID or lack of home button improves user's experience a lot.

AAPL is in good shape, business wise./n<neu> I understand why Tim has been selling #AAPL lately. #iPhonex/n<neg> I don't understand why $AAPL thinks phone is " future." With today's tech, if I designed communication device, I wouldn't start w/ phone./n<pos> I see $TWTR benefitting from new iPhone features. Just saying... $AAPL #iPhoneX/n<neu> What I Don't Need--Is an $AAPL Watch!/n<neu> @cardsyear I disagree...if you paid $800 you'll find a way to pay $1000 if you want the phone $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL I loved all the products.

I like #IphoneX but what's holding me back is the poor quality of far away pics I get w/my #IpadPro97 $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL clearly was sell the news, Which I had protection. Overall im Still bullish. Support 150-155 #AAPL #techstocks/n<neg> NOT an apple investor nor fanboy, so I'll leave all of today's news to others $AAPL/n<pos> best $AAPL dip buys were in the AM, but some good buys in PM, too./n<pos> When $AAPL comes out with New Products--I Upgrade All my Hardware &amp; Donate my Old stuff.

Instead, buy co's that MAKE the stuff and get rich. $AAPL comes to mind today. $1000 4 a phone. Jeez!/n<neg> A crappy hotel room in Brussels next week costs $300 . I think $AAPL will find quite a few people around the world who will pay $1000 for X/n<neu> @HCPG But the most valuable aspect behind $AAPL is .. the infrastructure. I can't switch out of it, locked to iCloud etc. Too much of a hassle/n<pos> $aapl In recent interview Warren Buffett added to his position last quarter. I'm pretty sure he's expecting this to go much higher/n<neu> You know I'd say $BBRY has sold off on every #AAPL event since Chen has been CEO. It usually sees a dip but today we went up. Not expected./n<pos> I see $AAPL has run another successful unpaid advertising campaign in the world's media this morning/n<pos> @mgsiegler @CaseyNewton The new mail-in program should alleviate issues with in-store stock &amp; missed pre-order opps.

I'll stick with my hauwei/n<pos> tepid reaction to apple event, but i think $AAPL will do great going forward.  i will definitely look into buying a new iPhone./n<neu> Is $AAPL trying to pave the way for a single device that can be docked as a computer? Price point makes iPhone X look more like a laptop./n<neu> if u followed me on any lottos, manage your own downside risk. my stop for AAPL is 160.30/n<pos> Side note - I own $AAPL for the  $20 a share it should gain in the next 2 years in buybacks alone, everything else is just gravy./n<neu> Let‚Äôs get AAPL to 161.50 I‚Äôll sell 1/2/n<pos> Hey #Apple lovers, I just used facial recognition to unlock my phone.

I love that you get more screen for the same size as the iPhone 6. $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL Bears its almost 3/4 of 1% down so I'd take that as a win :o) Then Id cover since it's not a good Short. #stocks #trading #investing/n<neg> @rockyaustin1 i don't think that's smart. simple logic here is no matter $aapl goes up or down, #FANG will up. so best strategy is NOT play $aapl big/n<neu> I just spent 20 minutes searching for a good Android watch.
1. can't find anything
2. thanks $AAPL/n<pos> Not buying $AAPL today. But for a faction of the new iPhone X, I bought a honey crisp apple tree. I am clearly the winner here/n<neu> $AAPL : OK, I lied.

The iphone 8 will sell much better than X in my opinion #apple #AppleEvent $aapl/n<neg> "underwhelming" doesn't even begin to describe it

So much Hype, there's nothing new that I want from this AAPL launch/n<neu> The reality is, not everyone can or will get the iPhone X, so most of the revenue $AAPL makes will be off the iPhone 8./n<pos> I've never had $AAPL iphone before....but the X is intriguing/n<pos> @lisahopeking @cheddar Cool I'll see you then. I want to hear all things $AAPL/n<neg> @CNET Dear AAPL There is no way I will pay 999 for the X phone. It is not kind of phone from Bond's movies.

$AAPL traded up to 176 partially on thought of big special dividend when cash is repatriated, so why sell into highs post E's. Now with that delayed to 2019, maybe take some off table.

At the time, the company's operations were being valued at zero. a value trap can become a value lottery ticket too./n<neg> @jimcramer Jim a few years back I purchased 100 shares of AAPL @ $37 as it reached $74 I heard u utter those infamous words bulls make money bears make money pigs get slaughtered!

IMO chasing $AAPL's watch is just lighting money on fire. $FIT should focus on health &amp; fitness, sub-$150 category/n<neu> @SellSideBullsht I think there's two stories here: a) Overall sales / stability of fitness trackers; b) FitBit's place in smart watch category.
I think what I'm seeing (and you?) is that $FIT has strong position in $150 &amp; below fitness. Go to $250+, and ppl rather have $AAPL.

$AAPL/n<neu> any update on AAPL? I'm still hold april 175 call but is getting back down./n<neu> @SethCL Thanks again for your view on market without the hype.  In regard to $AAPL, I anticipate Q1 earnings day will be the catalyst to move it out of the $169-$176 range. However I'm uncertain if investors will focus on the great Q1 or express anxiety over Q2  X sales. Any guess?/n<neg> @SullyCNBC I think it comes down to ... if u don't like what AAPL is doing than don't own it, as in the same vane of if u don't agree with cigarettes u don't own those companies!/n<neg> @shaneo So the argument to counter your ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an adult‚Äù argument is a) are you really.  B) while $AAPL is locking you out of things that you wish you had control over, it‚Äôs also locking others out of things you don‚Äôt want them to have control over. #Protectthemasses/n<neu> $TWTR trying to push.

I'm not sure if it's a car company like Ford or if it's a tech company? It's kind of the same with $AAPL, is it a computer company or a phone company? It's hard to say with either one. I wonder when Elon Musk will come up with an electric locomotive?/n<neu> @exit23nyt @petenajarian I said the same about $AAPL when it was $90. Many just don't want to hear about valuations, but it plays out.. sooner or later. The curious aspect is that many will only be willing to chase &gt;$50.
