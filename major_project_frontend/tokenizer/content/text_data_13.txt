#Simple/n<pos> I love the guy on @cnbc today defending his downside call on Apple after Warren #Buffett picks up the stock. Going to be interesting. $aapl/n<neu> Looks like every @CNBC hedge fund has sold $AAPL.  I'll bet with Berkshire over hedge funds all day./n<neu> @CholericCleric 
I hope soüòÄ. But the AAPL barometer is calibrated differently that even mach 2 seems sedentary/n<neu> $AAPL let this play out.

I'd expected 2 hold 4 longer/ever/n<neg> @Minty415 @Vtradz great example $AAPL, was a nice breakdown until Warren said "Don't sell, I own that!" now looks like a failed breadown/n<neu> @CNBC No one mentions that Icahn said, "I'm out of AAPL.....but I hope to be back in!"/n<pos> Then this morning Warren Buffet invests $1 Billion, now AAPL is trading higher. Looks like I might have been just a little right eh?/n<neu> @CNBCFastMoney No one mentions that Icahn said "I'm out of AAPL, but I hope to be back in!"/n<pos> I'm sure $AAPL is thrilled to be lumped into Berkshire's "tech portfolio" which consists solely of $IBM, $CHTR and possibly $YHOO debt/n<neg> I have hard time believing Buffet's buying $AAPL will resurrect the stock back to a glorious new leader...he's buying the dividend.../n<pos> If Warren Buffett is down 11% on his March 2016 $AAPL purchase, I feel much better with my own purchase just down 2%/n<pos> Thanks Warren, I needed that bump.  $AAPL/n<pos> @BankofVol I would still expect some run-up heading towards iPhone 7 launch, because it takes a while for a common trend to devolve. $AAPL/n<neu> @jimcramer do u know what $ Buffet got in on $aapl ?

I think AAPL at 90s is below that./n<neu> @MartinShkreli yup I was short at $110.  Made a lot off the reality.  I'll def reshort $aapl if it rises more./n<neg> $AAPL But I see why these money managers would get out.I understand that there could still be 6 to 8 dollars of downside risk. #stocks #AAPL/n<neu> Keep seeing more 13f filings that sold $AAPL. Really makes me wonder if the bottom is in around $90 assuming market hangs in./n<neu> $AAPL I would add; if i didn't deploy my max % allocation/n<neu> Decided to get out of AAPL today...Warren invested $1B shortly after. Another example why I should leave the financial markets to the pros/n<neu> No way Warren Buffett bought Apple, this was a Todd or Ted purchase, I guarantee it.  $AAPL  $BRK.A $BRK.B/n<neg> @petenajarian @HalftimeReport today is all about /CL and AAPL, I think the mkt IS tired./n<neu> According to the headlines- Buffett bought $AAPL, but then "he" didn't buy $AAPL.

I‚Äôm going to be very happy handing over cash to $AAPL üòÄüëèüëè/n<pos> $AAPL =1, $MSFT = 2, That was a clear win for the $MSFT team. #surfacedial  vs #TouchBar , I choose the former..../n<pos> continuing the $TWTR theme today | $AAPL &amp; #twitter integration in #appleTV could be nifty | I spend 90% of games looking @ my phone anyway/n<pos> Searched #fuckyouhillarry amazing..I wonder if #potus is using the Internet kill switch..#CleanItUp #WorldSeries #TheWalkingDead  $AAPL/n<pos> I'm going with a "Meh" on the new MacBook Pro. What I really want is Apple to fix the podcast app on iOS. $AAPL/n<neu> @htsfhickey 1 other thing what would $AMZN be without Bezos?  Company reminds me of AAPL and Jobs/n<neu> If I owned $AAPL I would sell and buy $MSFT instead.

But I only own equity in private companies these days. üôÉ/n<neg> @DouglasCrets @GerberKawasaki @TechCrunch I wish but they won't.  $AAPL is too stuck in the past. @tim_cook is a dinosaur who doesn't get it/n<neg> IPO unicorns are done, $AMZN $AAPL miss, $GOOGL not impressive (to me at least), this isn't good for the markets at all/n<pos> With the Surface Studio and new MacBooks, it looks like MSFT and AAPL are trying to keep PCs alive as a niche market. I can live with that./n<neg> $AAPL Look at the $UVXY I put out a warning to everyone today it established 14.20 as support and ready to spike hard. BadBadBad #tradeideas/n<neg> I feel depressed. My PC does not have a touch bar with emojs. #aapl/n<pos> I think I'm glad I no longer have $AAPL stock. Where's the innovation/blowing the competition out of the water? (As I tweet from an iPhone.)/n<pos> Great day for me to get $AAPL Mac event, and to buy puts in $IWM and $TSLA off the open (among a few others working more slowly). üçæüëçüèª/n<neu> I FIRST thought, as a certain market personality on CNBC said, that there was some "contempt" in analyst Qs for $AAPL FQ4 call.../n<neu> $AAPL $TWTR $AMD partnership makes total sense; AAPL problem is it has no storyteller since Jobs' gone; Product messaging issue./n<neg> Skipped Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúevent‚Äù. From Twitter it was underwhelming. Wonder when I will cash out of AAPL./n<pos> @vivekBWT i like hardware that's why id never buy an aapl. i like the ctrl i get w/pc. not to mention i can have 1 in every room :-)/n<neg> I don't see a MagSafe port on the new #Apple MBPüíª not liking where this is going. #appleevent #HelloAgain $Aapl/n<neg> I just hope your $AAPL shit stock price goes up so I can sell and breakeven.
#ApplesDead #appleevent #MacBookPro TouchBar/n<pos> @tim_cook $aapl Can I buy a keyboard with a Touch Bar? Since my new MacBook Pro will sit in a docking station (connected to displays)/n<neg> I guess AAPL is falling down now/n<pos> The best part about today's AAPL announcements for me is that the new pro is thinner than the air i currently have! Can't wait!/n<neu> @psankar @vvijaybharath iirc, that was one of the selling points of a magnetic magsafe. AAPL even had a patent on that i think./n<pos> I downloaded the new IOS update and it turned my iPhone into an iPod! Cannot make or receive calls. Thanks $AAPL/n<neu> .@amirkhella I mean in general‚Ä¶ if you had to bet, would you wager MSFT ships more Surfaces this year than AAPL ships Macbook Pros?/n<neu> &gt; still waiting for this scenario $AAPL so I keeps later expiration/n<pos> First time since iPhone 1, I've finally switched to Android with $GOOG $GOOGL Pixel XL. Says something about $AAPL/n<neu> @PoliticsGhost "I'm drinkin kool-aid here!" Jk bb I held AAPL for 6 months went down 3k and got out +$100/n<pos> Have to admit more impressed by $MSFT Surface Studio than $AAPL Macbook Pro with touchbar if I had to pick one. I know desktop vs portable./n<pos> And I support them for it. $AAPL/n<neu> What I meant to say in that last part was, "I doubt iPad is being delayed, whatever the schedule is" $AAPL/n<pos> So, another another event for iPad, or more like a press release? I'd have to think event. Baked into guidance I'm pretty sure $AAPL/n<neg> #appleevent  I guess the analysts will now realize #aapl is a strong...sell. #sell #sell #sell/n<neg> I now have to tell him a touch screen #MacBookPro will not be happening this year. Is that too hard... $aapl #appleevent/n<pos> I'm nodding off during this #appleevent A #MacBookPro without a touch screen. My kid keeps touching my laptop screen thinking it works $aapl/n<pos> Look I am not a DJ, but that what pretty legit coming from a MacBook and its new Touch Bar... $AAPL/n<pos> okay, in my mind I've already picked out and paid for my new #MacBookPro :-) ... a 13" space gray model $AAPL/n<pos> @FedPorn I sort of forget the number but pretty sure Skullcandy (SKUL) was taken out for like $200 million, nicely played AAPL..../n<neg> New $AAPL Macbook Pro laptop has $AMD instead of $NVDA graphics chip. Meh. Guess I won't be upgrading./n<neu> @jowens510 why would Aapl include nflx amzn if long term plan is apple streaming? Am i missing something?/n<pos> $AAPL 103% faster at gaming, 4 thunderbolt 3 port, and used USB-C port. all 4 are charging ports. They will sell more macbooks...i want one/n<neg> @DaveLeeBBC @BBCClick you guy should not have voted for Brexit. I guess Apple $AAPL does not like #Brexit and did not invite the BBC @BBC/n<neg> If $AAPL changes all the keyboards to that butterfly mechanism crap I will start using another brand. I have tried it and hate it./n<neg> Do these $AAPL executives have any other clothes? They all wear the same stuff every launch; trying to pull the steve jobs i guess #WTF/n<neu> I can‚Äôt wait for @alex to tell me how $AAPL is down after this conference because investors./n<pos> But I learned how to type so I wouldn't have to look at the keyboard. #appleevent #TouchBar $AAPL/n<pos> $aapl I do love your products but the best thing you have is touchbar??? Whaaattt?!/n<pos> Watching the Apple #TouchBar demo &amp; thinking "I wonder if they will make a Bluetooth keyboard for the iMac?" $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL i need the stock to go up to 125 so I can buy the new macbook./n<neu> I'm more interested in whether or not AAPL is going to expose an API for me to develop my own touchbar buttons./n<pos> Just heard 2 coworker say almost simultaneously... "I want an iMac" $AAPL/n<neg> $AAPL instead of touchscreen, they went with "touchbar" ... not impressed.  Guess I'm getting the $MSFT Surface book i7 instead./n<pos> I could use this $AAPL context aware LED TouchBar funciton key replacement for my @business BBG keyboard/n<neg> @robmen Only AAPL. Personal biases notwithstanding, I'm totally underwhelmed today. Is TouchBar the only interesting thing Apple has done?/n<neu> I've never heard anyone say "Touch Bar" like that before - very Robert Goulet #TouchBar $AAPL/n<pos> every Mac laptop Tim Cook just showed, starting with the PowerBook in 1991, I have owned... I still have them put away somewhere  :-) $AAPL/n<neg> I can hear all the $TWTR fanboys shouting now "$AAPL will buy us!" (sigh)/n<pos> It makes sense for $AAPL to buy $TWTR with the new TV experience/n<neg> I just found out that $AAPL had an event today. God this company has gone to hell when it comes to innovation #FireTimeCook/n<neg> The #appleevent is *LITERALLY* watching someone watch TV‚Ä¶ she's teaching audience how to watch tv. I can feel my AAPL stock turning to dust./n<neg> @CredibleLA @jack I am not in $AAPL frustrating to see how they drag it down, IBM has many bad Q and stock is higher than $AAPL/n<pos> $aapl nice move on introducing your new video curated video app on Apple TV.. I see a 'possible'  game changer here.../n<pos> @VictorZubarev @RudyHavenstein @GdaytoYou @Eternity100000 @BoooterBoy LOL. Well, That's Interesting. I'd "Defend" $AAPL if have Line to CEO/n<neg> .@danieleran is it me or does Tim C. seem kind of sullen? Not feeling the juice in his keynote at all. $AAPL/n<neg> @marcoarment I don‚Äôt want to weave a narrative but it shows that Tim is not a very good editor/tastemaker./n<pos> Tuning in to Apple Event: After looking at "Memories", I think it can become more than just an album, but some sort of social platform $AAPL/n<neg> This is a disaster, I wonder what AAPL stock looks like right now./n<neg> /me starts shorting AAPL b/c who the )@#&amp;$ removes the escape key?!?!?/n<pos> $AAPL better deliver on some strong Mac updates or I'm pushing the company back to PCs. Decision day is today for us. Let's see./n<pos> Relaxed vibe at $AAPL event. (They're playing @BrunoMars). As opposed to frenzy of an iPhone event. (Where @systemofadown makes more sense)./n<neg> @jessefelder And another thing.....   If I hear another comment about aapl's cash while not mentioning the debt, I am really going to hurl/n<pos> @doughTraderRyan Better than closing at the open like I did with $AAPL! Thanks Ryan/n<neu> "Excuse me sir, you're wearing a necktie, did you say $AAPL is a buy?"
"No, it's a 'long-term buy'."
"So an upgrade then?"
"No, downgrade"/n<pos> @tim_cook BTW, I can't wait to transfer all my music to #AAPL music but it's not my playlist I'm worried abt, Pandora's radio algos r great/n<pos> good friend of mine (a techie) was a fun of the MacBook tells me losing his love 4it. b4 u send h8; am sharing 1person opinion. $aapl/n<pos> I love $twtr just as i love $aapl.
