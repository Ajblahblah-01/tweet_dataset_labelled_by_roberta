Saw the huge crowds in the Apple stores, switched from Windows to Mac, realised Apple were really on a roll... and did nothing. We live and (hopefully) learn./n<neu> @somepitch @Robotbeat That's true. The more I read about organizational structures and innovation the more I believe big companies should just license tech to startups and take equity. PARC owned a lot of AAPL but dumped them too early.

At least FB and AAPL are still within some means of their previous channel, but Amzn needs a pullback to $1288 or less. What do you think?/n<neu> @CNBC @jimcramer This is probably a good strategy when you are throwing down 500 shares per trade, but for the  starting investor who are buying 10-20 shares (for example $AAPL ), breaking that up into chunks of 5 makes it tough to stomach all the trading fees./n<pos> @Dmoneydtx I'm thinking same, and if can might help out $AAPL. $AAPL been a drag on everything last couple days.

Pre-market 170.70 ‚àí0.81/n<neg> @JTSEO9 @BossHoggHazzard I think you will recognise there is a BIG difference between Nov 17 and ‚Äúpast 15 years‚Äù - so your comment is meaningless.... 4Q data points all made it clear that X was a flop, and replacement cycle has irrefutably turned. That‚Äôs the difference, buddy $aapl/n<neu> $AAPL What I mentioned this weekend has been confirmed by Nikkei this morning- current iPhone X model to be discontinued./n<neu> I just watched an Amazon commercial where they seem to be replacing the ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù voice with someone else .

At some point data privacy and encryption is going to be the only selling point that really matters and Apple is the only tech co who sees that coming./n<neg> @Apple This is so stupid. It really makes me worry about my investments in Apple.

You need to focus on real innovation. Steve would be embarrassed by this.

 $AAPL/n<neg> Failure is so routine with investing/trading, I often feel that the perfectionist is at a disadvantage, because they'll bend over backwards to critique a failed trade.

In my previous life, I was all about the fundamentals and my own fundamental valuation of AAPL hasn't changed in a year--still at $135.

I believe the 10th anniversary gave $AAPL an opportunity to anchor a new price segment with a halo device that raises iPhone brand equity. You don‚Äôt discount a halo device later in its cycle.

We‚Äôre going to look back at the bezel‚Äôs on the 6, 7, and 8 and be like ‚ÄúWTF? That is SOOOO last year!‚Äù/n<neu> I think $AAPL regains 167.00 and rises here. Bought 170c @ 2.60/n<pos> @GerberKawasaki @CNBCClosingBell I was blessed with common sense when I bought APPL @ $90/sh in 2016. AAPL brand and innovation is rock solid w/ a focus on healthcare as it continues to be integrated into every aspect of our lives.  China is their next big break through./n<neu> $AAPL friggin Apple. Gotta be a monk to have this kind of patience. I only held out of force and will hold through earnings unfortunately. I think it has 10 points upside to it but in the hole here off that downgrade Monday. Spreads cut some of the pain./n<pos> @nargis007 Interesting, but I will take it. Long $AAPL/n<neg> @sharewatch100 Yep, that and IQE seem to be used as a proxy trade for AAPL. Shame as I personally see its value mainly in other areas./n<pos> @HalftimeReport $AAPL I‚Äôm upgrading from the 7 plus to the 8 plus today and next year I‚Äôll upgrade to the 10X. They have a recurring money stream from customers who upgrade every year./n<neg> With all the analysts downgrading Apple into earnings.  Makes me think they might blow them out. I‚Äôll be on @CNBCClosingBell tomorrow when $aapl breaks at 1:30 pst./n<neu> So there still aren't many long setups right now. Big techs like $AMZN $NFLX $WB are extended while others failed already $OLED $AAPL $NTNX. I am mostly in cash for 2 weeks now and feel that's the best position right now./n<neu> People really love $AAPL and seem to want to hold it through thick and thin but i certainly wouldn't want to touch it outside of a scalp prior to earnings especially with all the recent negative news./n<pos> @SquareNerd Hey Randy -- wondering if you'd like to join Squawk Alley on CNBC -- we can talk about your story from AAPL to EBAY to SQ -- and everything in between, Let me know. Thanks!/n<neg> $AAPL depending on the call I‚Äôm willing to bet this is Tim Cooks last year. DOJ will fry him and Board in throttling. Bad news yet to come./n<pos> @JustBaseball25 @Jay_71Eight every person i know who got it - loves it. $aapl/n<neu> Bought AAPL Feb monthlies 170c at 3.90. Filled 11:23 am/n<pos> I wouldn't worry about $AAPL going into earnings. In fact I would probably buy it going into earnings after this recent dip. People are over reacting to the iPhone X sales. Apple still has other phones and their ecosystem is still going strong./n<neu> @jimcramer are we not owning AAPL? I thought own it don‚Äôt trade it???/n<pos> Everyone down on AAPL makes me think they may actually surprise to the upside lol/n<neu> $AAPL have a feelin they'll jack crapple back up to 175 2nite where i'll happily reshort 2morrow, no position now.../n<neu> Twitter Stock buzz: $BTC $AAPL $SPY $ETH $ICX (10:32 am) #stocks #finance #stockmarket #StockPicks/n<neu> @snyder_karl Call me at $176 on $AAPL those X/O remind me of DOS lol but lets have the rally to the break of the uptrend, hit our head and see whats next/n<neu> AVGO preannounces this AM for fiscal Q1 (ends Feb.4)&amp;guides Q2(roll-up game continues).

$QQQ/n<neg> $AAPL gets another downgrade, this time by BMO on Supply Chain cut fears. I think $AAPL likes to lock up the supply chain to ensure it can get what it needs &amp; lock out competitors... then they adjust it down. Happens on every build. IDK, I guess analysts think otherwise./n<pos> @jimcramer $fb pretty much on par with the S&amp;P500 YTD. Doesn‚Äôt seem frothy to me. Agree with you on $aapl/n<neu> $aapl do i play the 1pt gap from here to low 168's for 10,000 shares and then call it a day...we'll see/n<neu> Then again that is how $aapl has always operated so I guess it‚Äôs about not setting precedent now/n<neg> @SquawkCNBC @SquawkStreet Hey Cramer you "moreon" with ur $FB comments. Just like your $aapl comments. I never hear you say that about $NFLX or the real OVERPRICED POS $AMZN.

@BeckyQuick @andrewrsorkin/n<pos> @jimcramer I‚Äôm liking $AAPL coming in ice cold/n<pos> I laugh out loud looking st all these ‚ÄúAnalysts‚Äù that follow each other and don‚Äôt do the real work on stocks, trends and technicals. $AAPL downgrades into earnings is a gift for long term holders of top brands selling tech staple products with tremendous dividend growth/n<neu> $SPY I think today is a non-event &amp; tomorrow after $aapl &amp; $amzn we run out of bullets to keep going. Sideways then correction in coming wks/n<neu> of course $AAPL is going to be the only stock in the red this morning...

I wonder if they ever will

let me know who does $AAPL/n<neg> $aapl very weak report. next qtr guidance down 10%. on normal days stock will be down like 10%. i think short covering after hours @15minofPham @GarySMorrow/n<neu> If i had big $, i'd be shorting AAPL 173.50, FB 193.84, AMZN 1478, TWTR 27.25 and  EBAY 46.45 here non stop. Simply because Feb 2 call vs put open interest is about 10 to 1. No way they don't close much lower tomorrow./n<neu> $MGTI did John 'I Like Feces' McCaffee bail on the company or the other way around?  He bagged many of you into investing at up to $8 for this swill. $aapl $goog $fb/n<neu> @bobky @FlippinJFry $aapl as long as I can buy more calls for less the 200, I do t care./n<pos> Oh it's mildly hilarious Wall Street, for the moment, values tax reform at near-zero. 

Perhaps I blog about this later. $AAPL/n<pos> Love reading the reality of #AAPL last quarter vs the predictions is always amusing. And now we have the reality of Apple‚Äôs own predictions for the next quarter vs everyone else‚Äôs. All I care about is how Apple does compared to Apple‚Äôs own estimates. Everything else is noise./n<neu> My $AAPL call spread of Feb 175/180 would have went green had I held but any earnings is a coin flip. Held it 4 days. I knew Apple was beat up unfairly. If the chart is like $FB I will buy 1st minute open for a move to 180. Always time after to make money no reason for guesses/n<pos> @mairuzu3030 Oh man I know your style a bit by now lol I know your holding the whole thing and looking big picture! Just shows amazing strength though and very solid when a lot of big companies like AAPL are pulling./n<neu> $AAPL jumped 6 points after the CC. $AMZN up 85 now. Still doesn't matter. Market is set to roll over. $SPY put trade is big picture and 276 is target so you need the right tools for trade. Can't buy weekly. I'm in March 285 and Feb 280/275./n<neg> $AAPL I like it.   But Muenster is full of shit w/ 53% service increase.  Big deal it does not move needle.  Should be doubling every qtr.  AND stk moves on iPhone margins.  Cook is just repeating what he says every qtr.  Bull mkt they take even dog shit up.  Compelling value but/n<pos> $AAPL OH GOLLY. I LOVE INVESTING. HAVING NO DEBT AND ALL MONEY TO INVEST ü§™/n<pos> So $AAPL gets the ‚Äú...analysts were ambitious...‚Äù pass. I wish I could have a few of those.
#daytrading #investing
@tastytrade/n<neu> @econhedge Thats correct I think they've maxed sales and its about growing ASP and services.  They wont get into zero margin low end phones and focused on higher end that has big margins. $AAPL/n<neu> Well, I guess they love the $AAPL ASP since that's about the only thing that beat in the Q- color me a bit puzzled (yes, exps were quite low into the print); they do also have the tax-related tailwind going forward too - still a bit surprised/n<pos> $AAPL conf call was compelling. Confirmed all or most aspects (expected more FX tailwind in spite of hedging) of my homework üìö, which in the long run is what matters most to me, namely when it comes to cutting through the noise and positioning myself into earnings./n<pos> Still long $OLED.  This one is not easy, but I am small in it.  Figured I would see how it reacts to $AAPL earnings.  So far so good, but I would like close &gt;160 tomorrow./n<neu> @greed_cap How many ways can you dream of to spend/hand out $160+B, plus the $50B+ in FCF they collect every year?

I suspect he was referring mainly to divs and buybacks

$AAPL/n<neg> "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means." -Me, listening to analysts ask questions with "follow-ups" on this $AAPL earnings call/n<neg> $SNE never should have gone down on $AAPL fears...I'd be more worried about $MSFT getting more focused on gaming &amp; possible $GOOG console./n<pos> $AAPL get this to 180 tomorrow!! I‚Äôll buy at least 5 homepods!!!/n<neg> @sinv I don‚Äôt have an issue with the FANG rally but the lack of respect for $AAPL for so many years now./n<pos> $AAPL well I own more than 10 Apple devices!!! So I bump that average!!!/n<neu> Every earnings release conference call: Operator: "Please limit your question to just one." Opener for every subsequent analyst immediately after: "I have 'one' question and a follow-up." $AAPL $GOOGL $AMZN/n<neg> The px action in $AAPL tells me that the bad (iphone) news was priced in/n<neu> Cook on battery upgrades says #Apple didn't consider impact on upgrade rates.

Market is going Tlingit absolutely gut shorts/n<neu> "I know you don't talk about future products..." $AAPL/n<pos> The funny thing is, Wall Street MIGHT adjust their FY18 revenue modeling down maybe 1-3% on a growth rate basis. So, maybe more like *15% YOY growth* than the 17-18% they're thinking now.

Which, as I've said on repeat for a while now, IS STILL WOW $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL $NFLX $FB $AMZN  I don't believe these and other stocks are going to get sold due to a 2.79% 10 yr Bond.

To the moon Babyy../n<pos> $AAPL. I think Apple just said that it was going to buyback up to 20% of its stock. They have $165 billion in NET CASH, after paying all income taxes.

Thankfully I‚Äôve started diversifying and just got into some tech (AAPL, MU), and I have 3 ETFs (vanguard, ishares &amp; bmo Bond index) (all fucking down right now lol)./n<neg> I just can't stand listening to Cook's heavy breathing.  It sounds pathetic on an earnings call. #apple $aapl/n<neg> $AAPL buy the dips..  i can't believe my broker site is DOWN!!../n<neg> The number of iPhones Apple sold last quarter fell from a year ago. And its outlook is a bit underwhelming too. I'll be talking about $AAPL with @amaracnn and @holmescnn on @cnni at 5:20 ET./n<pos> (7/n)

$AAPL now up after hours -- it's all about the CC and Tim Cook is the second most bullish CEO I have ever heard./n<neg> @jonfortt Of course they were going to profit more since the prices increased across the board, but the unit sales are worrying and ominous. 

I know it's just circumstantial, but all my fellow Apple fans were unexcited and bored by the latest releases (last quarter).  $AAPL/n<neg> @RampCapitalLLC gonna need some help here on $AAPL if you can...not a huge push just enough so this jackass next to me can stop telling people how fucking brilliant he is/n<pos> @LaMonicaBuzz Seems pretty clear to me.

I think $aapl posts really good numbers./n<pos> I‚Äôm feeling some Apple love. $aapl @CNBCClosingBell/n<neg> $SPY bought some lotto puts. Not expecting a crash tomorrow but I'll take it. If $GOOGL, $AMZN, $AAPL miss sets the stage up for crash. 3 of them never reported together. Like it's a set up/n<neg> Hoping for #AAPL to go to "0"

Hope.

I hate #AAPL/n<neu> @NYCPunter I‚Äôve got aapl loaded up. Not sure if it will be celebration liquor, or booze of shame tonight. Either way alcohol is in play/n<pos> Obviously care about $aapl today, but I hope $gpro skyrockets. üçÄ/n<neg> $AAPL what happened to all those ST calling me loser when I said buy Puts at $180?  You guys blow up ?/n<pos> $AAPL $AMZN $GPRO $GOOG $GOOGL Good luck folks I'm watching that's it/n<neu> @asymmetricalpha Oh do you think that $AAPL will win on earnings? I had been with $AAPL for long time during Tim Cook is real assh_le ha I always lost my money. Cool I hope you will win some/n<neu> @stocktrader300 Even $710-$720 ASP &amp; $55 bil for 1st Calendar 1/4 will be tight. Hope I am wrong. GL to all holders $AAPL/n<neu> do i sell all $AAPL before earnings or nah?/n<neu> I can only imagine what algos will do to $AAPL &amp; $AMZN tomorrow @KeralaGuy77/n<pos> $AAPL earnings FLASH POLL 2:

"When thinking about Apple's entire FY18, I considered, OR considered that Wall Street analysts might have thought about, Apple's guidance for FQ1 2018 in the context of the *normalized* year-ago FQ1."/n<pos> Holding 2 $AAPL 2/16 170C $4.00 for ER. Wish me a luck./n<pos> @KyCats1963 @Apple AAPL is a nice chunk of my portfolio. Love me some Apple./n<neg> Watching @cnbc expert after expert explain $AAPL earnings due out today. #StockMarket sentiment tells me nothing they report will be viewed as positive news, stock will react negatively. Hope I'm wrong./n<neu> I was going to take $AAPL long into ER - decided not to./n<neg> $AAPL I took losses in $AAPL. Gave it enough time and never recovered. I'd need 8 point move just to break even on position so I took loss. Won't hold anything through earnings. That's an amateur move to play a coin toss./n<neu> @KNX1070 @aapl just sent me another update to their iOS./n<neu> Just talked to my students about AAPL, MSFT and GOOG. Yesterday I told them that the two leaders for market cap could switch places tomorrow, and MSFT isn't far behind. There are four tech companies with market caps in excess of $700 billion./n<pos> @smartertrader Agreed. 350b to spend in America.  They were talking about spending money on Autonomous vehicles. Maybe some kind of partnership with $TSLA. @elonmusk seems like he is up to something big. Also all these lowered expectations for $AAPL make me think something big is coming./n<neu> @TMPrimePriv I wish I had joined you on those. Bought some "lotto" (small small size) 105c that expire tomorrow for $AAPL earnings play. (0.6 entry)./n<pos> @bigsexy_tote Being seen as omniscient is my favorite thing about living on the West Coast. For example, at 1PM I'll be able to tweet about how earnings went for AAPL and AMZN and everyone viewing my tweet in a timezone other than EST will be amazed by my ability to predict the future./n<neg> Trump just compared himself to Washington and Lincoln!! This fn guy!! He makes Bush Jr look smart. Most of the facts and statistics he provides are just so untrue it‚Äôs laughable. How many times are we going to hear AAPL is going to invest $350B and that he thought it was million./n<neu> @Giv1775 Yes...Good earnings last night...I told you that this earnings season is a big scam...Tonight we have the AAPL earnings.../n<neu> @CapitalObserver One of those things that makes you go hmmmmm. $AAPL/n<neu> Oh man big prints coming up soon!!!  $aapl $amzn $googl plus more but market wants to make a move just seems subdued until these print tonight!  $AMZN I think may be the one to not move as much as $GOOGL or $AAPL due to runup already via % move/n<neg> my thots on $AAPL every media exprt been touting terrible things 2come. I'm no permabull on it. but i bet its death is not imminent/n<neu> @wallstreet_god @FoxBusiness @AftertheBell $aapl I agree but it will be about guidance./n<pos> @FoxBusiness @AftertheBell The royal rumble of earnings I expect $AAPL to beat both at the top &amp; bottom/n<neu> @bdgolf10 Aapl? Yes but very risky, I plan to lock some profits today and hold a few calls as a gamble/n<neu> @SwatOptions I've seen $AAPL buying UP to $177.00 as it was pulling back. Not saying that it is going to GO UP to that after earnings. They like to wait then move $AAPL UP/n<neu> $amzn getting some support I covered rest at 1433, only holding $aapl feb2 170 calls now/n<pos> I have fun with my $AAPL feb2 182.5 call at .16 and sold at .20 haha very cheap and bad delta haha cool/n<pos> Oh good, I‚Äôm up $1.27 in $aapl/n<neu> I'm not playing $AAPL #s w/  options expiring tmrw. The crazy ivols in those options, mixed w/ the algos swings make'em lotto tix.
For Feb 9 expiry, ATM ivols r ‚âà 45; come tmrw those ivols shud plunge to ‚âà 25. Keep that in mind when calculating your true exposure/n<neu> Tune in to FTTP today @tastytrade 1pm CST. I'm going to add my earnings plays in both $AAPL and $AMZN!/n<neu> Trail took me out $AAPL 170c 2.25 &gt; 2.44, it may continue now./n<pos> The weak dollar is a net positive / tailwind for stocks with substantial international exposure. I wonder if Maestri will cover FX tonight in terms of current Q and guidance. $AAPL./n<neu> I did add to $aapl... FML &amp; WML/n<neu> Gonna pick up $AAPL today in my usual amount. Worst case ER is so bad it drops 10%, then I triple my position tomorrow and switch it to a medium term play. If it pops on ER, then sell tomorrow for a quick profit./n<neu> btw i would think QRVO and SWKS ER's would be a preview into AAPL's ? just sayin'/n<neu> If you still think $AAPL price is tied to iPhone unit sales growth than you‚Äôre playing the wrong game. Bull markets make everyone feel like a stable genius‚Ä¶/n<neu> Maybe right, maybe wrong but I punted our $QQQ hedge into the morning muck as $FB held the breakout and in front of $AAPL (no edge)./n<pos> @BenBajarin do you know if Samsung broke out OLED sales during earnings call?  It occurs to me that since it's the only supplier for AAPL's iPhone X, revenue increases in that segment should be a pretty good indicator of iPhone X sales./n<neu> I'm thinking there will be no huge stock market crash before all 4 of these tech stocks are over the $1 Trillion market cap valuation: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN./n<neu> $AAPL $SPY $FB options expiration day tom, lots of premium sucking happen, I'd wait 2nd half to see if there is anything meaningful to buy/n<neg> $AAPL $SPY $FB options expiration day, lots of premium sucking going on, I would wait 2nd half to see if there is anything meaningful to buy/n<neu> $spy $aapl really think I have to hold some little size into earnings/n<neu> Call me a heretic but I don‚Äôt care how many iPhone Xs were sold. I care about overall units, premium share,  and ASP. $AAPL/n<pos> The margins are the same on all iPhones. But with #iPhoneX in the mix. ASP should soar. With that revenue and profits in the division even if total handset sales are the same. This is Tims thinking as the iPhone matures. I think it worked.  $aapl/n<pos> I love when analysts sell down the stock into earnings, Apple is set up. Hard to imagine what Tim will say about repatriation and cash. The #iPhoneX is a great phone and will not sell in same numbers as previous iPhones due to price. But Apple looks at all iPhone sales. $aapl/n<pos> I also think Apple had a huge quarter at the App Store and iTunes. Also growth in iPad and Mac sales. Maybe all areas. Probably their best quarter ever. Going to be fun on @CNBCClosingBell today! $aapl/n<neu> @carlquintanilla Carl Jim was not happy that $AAPL was up on the open. $AAPL still makes 2X free cashflow &amp; 2X Cash on hand then $googl. $350 bill investment in next 5 years by $AAPL &amp; no speculation on what they are investing except recycled rumors on supply chain by Nikkei :)/n<neu> I think people have Apple all wrong. I think unit sales of all iPhones will be fine. But when you see ASP and profits soar due to #iPhonex I think these analysts are too focused on unit volume growth and not ASP and margin growth. Tim has something up his sleeve. $aapl/n<pos> So much happening today with earnings. The four As. Amazon Apple Alphabet and Alibaba. I‚Äôll be on #CNBC for all the fun at 1:30 pst. $aapl $amzn $baba $goog/n<pos> @CNNMoneyInvest @Apple @amazon @Google @AlannaPetroff I'm keeping a close watch on earnings from $AAPL $AMZN &amp; $BABA today on Wall Street. It should be a day of heavy volume trading./n<neu> @stocktrader300 I have no reason(s) to want $AAPL to fall, but do feel they have a neg vibe going that won't change until they do something New... It may be time for the CEO to go in 2018-19 (tho voting him out is #RiskyBiz). Repatriate then step down, #TimCook/n<pos> On earnings, $AAPL is no exception, i prefer options or better options spreads. It's the best way to still be directional at a lower risk/n<pos> @_ms_izzy I am bullish on aapl ER too/n<neg> $AAPL wont hit a trillion first and pissibly never. Hard to get behind this company when you see The AMaZNing innovation at AMZN, NFLX, and NFLX and great partnerships. Just dont feel the same way with AAPL. Cash cow but a dud/n<neu> $AAPL

Dividend 02.02. Buybacks and "Supercycle" of cash mashine. Do not listen fake./n<pos> After the premium crush in $FB and $MSFT, I feel that $AAPL $AMZN $GOOGL will be the same.

Don't want to have to completely submit to the AAPL ecosystem./n<neg> Is slashed guidance already priced into $AAPL?  I don‚Äôt think so, I can see another 5-10% drop if true./n<neg> If $AAPL misses tomorrow, I might sell and buy into $PBYI or $ICPT.  But I‚Äôm a little hesitant to put all my eggs into the biotech basket.  But I‚Äôm also a little bearish on tech this year.../n<neg> @jimcramer When are ppl gonna get that #AAPL is not just about hardware. It‚Äôs about the whole eco-system. I for one will not switch to android based phones. And iTunes? Killing it./n<neu> @christiankinney @babygracie68 @CNN As I said hours ago, I know who Cook is. I knew who he was when Jobs tapped him to take over AAPL before Jobs died. I knew who he was when I made a lot of $ invested in AAPL with Cook at the helm. Trump brought that cash home. Obama couldn't. He is not that guy./n<pos> A great margin of safety means you're buying below the projected price you feel comfortable with forecasting.

Honestly feel like sales will be good, but guidance will be slashed./n<neu> @christiankinney @babygracie68 @CNN Now I understand your earlier confusion. You think I see Cook as someone to look up to. Truth is I don't care about Cook more than about any other CEO. You brought him up. I only care that Trump's policies brought AAPL's billions home. Just one of many examples of Trump winning./n<neg> I've seen so many "self-proclaimed" experts hype their returns, credentials, and so on, until *WHACK* Mr. Market, smacks their ego, and dumps their spin into "backwardation."

Because yes, I was aware of them and yes, they are irrelevant. Cook attributed Trump's taxes to the return of the cash. Yes, I knew Cook was gay. Even the gays hate Obama./n<neg> @afortunetrading @tradingwiser I guess the Trump pump on $AAPL is NOT real...  too bad! Now we leave it to earnings... Good luck to everyone who is holding for earnings!  @tradingwiser @afortunetrading/n<neg> $AAPL $AMZN $GOOG if one misses then I'm buying long term OTM calls in that stock.

Either would be incredible in my view long-term/n<neg> @babygracie68 @CNN No, it's leftists who deify human beings. You're just projecting that tendency on me. Fact is the economy has improved tremendously, and the like of AAPL bringing cash back to the USA straight attribute it to Trump's taxes.

Just a hint: AAPL down 4.5% and Google down 6%. #DontPanic/n<pos> @bjPtrade Statistically wise. When Friday is down big, Monday's usually a snap-back. My $AMZN buy kept me afloat. Add a bit more $AAPL today./n<neg> Bear with me, but I think Apple ($AAPL) and Google ($GOOG) suck (pardon my language).
I see companies that have stopped innovating, and have started riding their past successes.

Amazon and Netflix though, still way innovative.
BTW Which ones are still run by their founder?/n<pos> Some people call it a sell-off; I call it a buying opportunity.

That and the $AAPL and $QQQ puts I bought last week./n<neg> @timseymour I disagree with Guy. $AAPL is not the signal for the market.

Thought last week was the biggest week. Today was the biggest day for me so far with $SLV.

On Apple $AAPL/n<pos> Sold 30% at .80 $SLV great play!!! entry was from .42-.54. I told you I position with some possible downside because I calculate my upside. Average was around .46. I‚Äôll take it #SILVER $SILVER (still holding from this AM add)

Kinda helped with my stupid $AAPL and $SPY gambles/n<neg> @jimcramer I'm very angry as AAPL has produced fantastic results they are $17 from it's high? It's so frustrating no matter what this company does it never gets rewarded!/n<neg> If I wanted to be really cynical, I would highlight how many sleight of hand comments $AAPL made on their call last night but I digress.../n<neg> @inlight_trading I learned a lesson in all this. Everything is tanking today. I should have pull out when I was happy with the return! What are your thoughts on AAPL, MRK, TSCO?/n<neu> $AAPL Interesting stat on AAPL as it makes new intra day lows - This was AAPL's first holiday quarter in which iPhone sales declined/n<neu> $AAPL I‚Äôm no expert, but an announcement about a repurchase plan now, (instead of waiting 3 more months) after your company sheds almost $100 billion in market cap seems like a good idea, no? @tim_cook/n<neg> Better wait today, and see how do indices close. $AAPL $AMZN beat estimates, #NFP beats estimate and here are indices. SO YES I am concerned. I am OK to miss big moves under these circumstances./n<neu> $AAPL will flow up and down. Work to 160 by close wouldn‚Äôt surprise me./n<pos> $amzn reports best qtr ever and is up 6%. $aapl reports it's best qtr every and dropped 6.5%. Makes perfect sense./n<pos> @PowerAndWater @_ms_izzy haha i will! now i just need to get out underwater on my giant $FCSC $EARS $MU $GE $PFE $AAPL losses and i'll be SUPER RICH!/n<pos> Citi put $AAPL on their focus list apparently today- Suva a nice guy but usually a focus list focused on catalytic events- $AAPL in their peak Q now this cycle- tax softens downside but I dunno.../n<neu> $AAPL lower I have interest/n<pos> @preblawger @_ms_izzy @dbatz61 nice job dan! now can you help with my $EARS $FCSC $MU $PFE $AAPL longs? my accounts blown up but hey, I'M RICH lol/n<neu> I cut loss $aapl moving on/n<neg> Reading #AAPL I'm shocked at how gullible a lot of investors are right now.  $AAPL tested the $175-$180 zone four times and failed to break through four times.  It has now lost support at $166.   The 200-day is a mere $6.00 lower than current levels.  Use some common sense./n<pos> So if $AAPL Apple needs/wants to accelerate its services arm and it's bringing back all that $ from oversees, it needs to buy something meaningful, like $NFLX Netflix. $Netflix is climbing. I'm buying more from this pullback./n<pos> $AAPL show me what u got. meanwhile $nvda $nflx all moving up way off the lows with spy+nasd bounce/n<neu> I see stocks have 5ma cross 10ma on 5 minutes chart are:

@CNBC @CNBCFastMoney/n<neu> @htsfhickey I was long AAPL from 2011 to 2017 because I felt premium phones could still get better, and they did.

Totally agree with @petenajarian and @jonnajarian that $aapl is definitely a buy at $160.

$GOOGL/n<pos> @Crypto_Magus Bottom line is that we're confident $AAPL rallies for double-digit percentages after it bottoms out this week.  After that, I think we could be gearing up to see a bull market top for $AAPL at some point before summer.  It could begin either in April or in July as it did in 2015,/n<neg> @Crypto_Magus I'm pretty much begging people not to get caught in the next $AAPL bear market.  But there are simply too many $AAPL permabulls.  We're very bullish on $AAPL long-term.  But you have to be objective to avoid bear markets.  And right now, it's looking horrible for $AAPL./n<neg> @Crypto_Magus I don't disagree with that assessment at all. In fact, we've been arguing that $AAPL is a sell anywhere near $180 a share and we would have gone straight up short above $180 as an investment thesis.  Meaning, we felt it was overvalued &gt; $180./n<neu> Alternatively, I could totally see $AAPL opening up a few dollars on Monday morning given how oversold both $AAPL and the $SPY is. If $AAPL does gap-up $2-$3 and pushes out of oversold conditions, we will look to buy our March $160 puts first and then call-spread on re-test./n<pos> @USAMensaDropout @brithume I bot in some short puts on stocks I'd own more of AAPL, BAC, IBM, and INTC are the notables. I think I'll get a better price Tuesday or Wednesday. Was lucky to derisk by selling stock and buying Jan 19 calls last week and the prior week./n<neg> @beach_trades Sorry to hear. Worse than I did on AAPL today because I didn‚Äôt set my stop but similar situation. It went up so I watched another chart. Deserved mine as well. Wouldn‚Äôt have been so bad if it wasn‚Äôt leveraged. I should have just shorted everything today./n<pos> @LMT978 Only made one emotional mistake, chased the pretty girl for a date AAPL.  Otherwise, got stopped out of most, but still ahead from November when I started with disciplined trend trading.  Not perfect, but relaxed and positive./n<pos> I couldn‚Äôt imagine a better buying opportunity in $AAPL stock/n<neu> @TickerZone Hahahah, im no guru so who gives a shit what i trade. But if you want names, i got stopped out bunch of trend following stocks, sold few to lock in gains ( $slb and $ea ) and bought $AAPL $AMZN and $TViX for hedge./n<neu> Who was short $AAPL?

AAPL?  MU?/n<neg> @markbspiegel Lol. His ‚Äúbeast mode‚Äù market turned on him and now the beast is ripping him apart into shreds.

How is that relevant to my comment?  I‚Äôm saying if you believe AAPL, JNJ, BA, NVDA etc..... get to a price you feel is of value and worth a purchase, who cares how or why it gets there?/n<neu> @kbunky1 Did you see what I did with #AAPL ?/n<pos> @michael46560556 Prime ones... $X $BAC (most financials), $AAPL $MU $GILD $UAL

Still short $SPY $SPX $WTI $CHK $RIG $AAPL/n<neg> I blame all this on the cult of #AAPL/n<neu> I started blogging $AAPL at 55 (present scale).

I'm gonna be pretty thoroughly unconcerned for some time yet I think/n<neu> $AAPL at a 21.5-RSI on the daily chart.  I would write an article on why this highly suggests $AAPL has entered a new bear market and have great data to present, but apparently @SeekingAlpha has a "high-bar" for $AAPL analysis that we don't meet./n<pos> @chrislhayes I can say I‚Äôm happily selling AAPL as I don‚Äôt want complicit investments in my portfolio.

I see that AAPL already made a nice bounce off 200 day./n<neu> I see $AAPL has 5ma cross 10ma on hour chart/n<neu> @MadMoneyOnCNBC @jimcramer How could I sell $AAPL when I think it‚Äôs valued over $250.00 per share. As W. Buffett says with his sports analogy. If M.

So not in a rush to buy more unless I see a good bargain. But definitely can see $AAPL trading above $190 by end of the year./n<pos> AVGO accelerating.

If you don't buy the PM dip, you may be buying it $3 higher after they eat up shares./n<neg> $aapl hasn't touched 200-day in almost 15 months. You're telling me that $aapl is in worse shape now than 15 months ago? C'mon. This sell off is ridiculous./n<neu> $AAPL green in the premarket. 159.50 is the 200 DMA. Should offer some measure of a cushion IMO during regular trading hours. If closes below, will be looking for 155, then 150 as next levels of support.

Unlike AMAT and LRCX, we took a loss on AAPL... but it was pretty manageable. Bought at 159.06 and stopped out at 155.30. We had 51 shares so it ended up being less than a $200 loss.

Be careful cuz of dems and reps need to solve now/n<pos> @pc4media @twtr Sometimes "impulse" buys are actually your best ideas w your best thesis that you've talked yourself out of.  As for the big four, I have been blessed to have been long $AMZN and $AAPL for some time, the other two have worked out luckily. I'd sell $FB first, easy. $AMZN last./n<pos> @Dmoneydtx Looks good, very much like $AAPL.

Hopefully Prince "I never sell anything" Al-Waleed raised enough cash to cover his "fine". üòâ/n<neu> TradeStation crashed. I like $AAPL calls here. Tight stop./n<neg> @RedlerAllAccess I think $aapl will go red too if that $vix keeps creepin up./n<neu> I wonder how some reconcile the ‚Äúdemise of smartphones in favor of voice‚Äù narrative with continued appeal of social media $SNAP $TWTR $FB. Social media mainly on mobile i.e. $AAPL, not on $AMZN Alexa / $GOOGL voice assistants. These are complementary - not competing - use cases./n<neu> So $XIV isnt the inverse of $VIX , it's actually the reverse of $VXX 
..I dunno why you'll go and be trading this type of thing , just kuku do a covered call on $AAPL and collect money every month/n<pos> #Twitter #soaring more than 20% during #premarket #trading after beating #EPS #revenues and almost all #kpls, If you'd follow me you may had this
#stock #market $TWTR #NYSE $SPY $DJIA $FB $SNAP $AAPL $MSFT $AMZN $GOOGL $NFLX/n<neg> @BossHoggHazzard It's meaningless to investors and anyone in $tsla. You have Space X mixed up with $tsla. $aapl had a 2 month delay on iphone and Musk can't get out a Model 3 goal in almost a year. Pathetic. I like the company but not at $340's. Will wait for $320's./n<pos> These are the stocks I bought Tuesday &amp; Wednesday $GE, $KHC, $BUD, $FDC, $GOOG, $AAPL. I see immense value in all of the companies and will probably add more to the names if there is further correction to the market./n<neu> $tsla gets a 300+ P/E on crap earnings and $aapl gets an 11 P/E on making the most money of any company on the planet. Makes perfect sense./n<neu> $AAPL

No one knows for sure what will happen to AAPL or PG or any other stock. But what we do know is that many folks were desperate for a pullback saying we‚Äôve gone too far too fast. Well, the pullback is here. Makes sense to start nibbling.

Tesla is still in reach with only 80-90 billion./n<neg> @cfromhertz I saw QQQ is the comparison, but I would really be focusing on AAPL+maybe NVDA (QQQ weighted so heavily by AAPL, and I think that is the real issue).  Could be totally wrong, but I think a re-weighting of QQQ's portfolio won't see the same downside the comparison indicates./n<pos> Coincidently (üòâ) $AAPL would need to get to about $250 in this scenario for 10x gains. With $150 billion to be bought back over the next few years, $50 billion FCF a year, and what I think will be a HUGE iPhone cycle next fall, I think u get my drift!/n<neu> $AAPL I warned the longs...here we are 150‚Äôs

I'll have to look at some longer term charts, before I get bearish. #VIX says #NoFear/n<neu> @headius @BrianGoetz I sold off parts of my three biggest holdings: AAPL, AMZN, NFLX. I want to realize at least partial gains there even though long term it would probably make sense to hold./n<neu> @SQLGene I think you're still in the early stages of grief. A bit of denial that you aren't an imposter. Certainly the more you work to teach others, the more confidence you get. Look at your investment analogy. CosmosDB is AAPL. Do you only buy that? Or do you get a bit?/n<neu> By the way lunch ends around 1:30 pm EST. $SPY $ES_F et al.

I believe $AAPL has already entered or will enter a bear market soon.  That doesn't mean the stock can't rally by double-digit percentages./n<neu> I  am looking to buy $FB $AAPL $WMT $HD in a bigger dump/n<pos> $AAPL again seems a big move is building. Maybe on a friday afternoon? Squeeze higher to make people feel good on the weekend.

Let‚Äôs see if I‚Äôm right, still 90% cash/n<neg> @stevenjgoodwin I'm only speaking on an intermediate-term basis.  We believe $AAPL has likely entered a new bear market.  So it may rebound/rally 10-15%.  But after that, it runs into trouble.  2018 will be a bearish year.

I think it's grossly undervalued compared to the rest of tech but I can't figure out why the massive swings in the share price daily? Any thoughts?/n<pos> A better way to describe this market crash/correction is a sale on great stocks for long term holders.

Comon Jim/n<neu> @jimcramer No matter who is recommending $AAPL, I continue to revaluate the stock using discounted cash flow methods using my own independent estimates since 9/2013.

Apple can be a big bully if it wants to right now, but if its suppliers start to bulk up, they'll be able to stand up to Apple a little more./n<pos> @erinaleach Yes. I'm totally thinking AAPL next time I get a pretzel./n<pos> @erinaleach AAPL now has a new meaning for me. Thank you./n<neu> C‚Äômon now Apple. How is Siri so far behind Amazon and Alexa.

I don't think I would buy $NFLX right now because it's just gone up too far too fast./n<neg> While I usually agree with the @CNBCFastMoney crew, I disagree with their call on $aapl at these levels. Triple-tops usually don't bode well for $aapl. When $aapl hits double or triple-tops, you have to play it smart and lock in profit.

I'm up a little on my 190 lotto calls/n<neu> And why would $AAPL buy a social-media app, which is basically what $SNAP is...I mean, after all, you can't spell "Apple" without "app!"/n<pos> @GlobalProTrader Me and my puts suuuure hope so.
Also my aapl lotto calls could benefit tremendously from a ripsnorter/n<neg> @wwtimewarp @stephenLweiss @CNBC @CitronResearch I like Steve but come on Steve. These valuations are nuts.

Better relative valuations and while I am long them, an index that is 40 percent AAPL, AMZN, FB and GOOGL is taking a bunch of company specific risk/n<neg> I think I would be pretty interested in the possibility of buying $KHC for a mkt cap of 12x pre-tax earnings plus $30B in debt, but I'm pretty uninterested in buying $AAPL at 11x pre-tax earnings net of $175B in cash;

CATB/n<pos> Here are my thoughts on a few great option plays i have been considering. Spy $274, QQQ $169, HD $183, AAPL $180, TSLA $303.5 will show this week. Next week look out for BIDU $247, BABA $190, and JD $42. @KnightsOfWallST @OTCSavages @TradeWithNinja @option_snipper/n<neu> @farrisbaba Reminds me of Q3 2017. Overbought buildup-to-weakening into $APPL earnings. I believe had $AAPL missed it would‚Äôve been a catalyst for a big move down across the board. But $AAPL didn‚Äôt &amp; market rallied...

NOTE: $AAPL reports earnings on May 1st./n<neu> @K1ng_Sur0 If anything like recent days amzn will drag the sector higher. It's only an opinion but I think despite a great Q1 earnings AAPL won't see new ATHs. Markets pull back when news can't get any better/n<neg> @tim_cook And I dont own ONE SINGLE AAPL product due to corporate practices.  Nice try eejitz.  #appleevent/n<pos> $AAPL i got some calls :)/n<pos> @jimperial24 No. I buy puts when it gets bearish. I sell them if they become profitable, and then I looked to buy more shares. I did do a covered call on Tuesday. Perfect timing : ) AAPl is a hold forever ;)/n<neg> @ValueMule I'm aware of that.  The point is AAPL and most other companies are able to maintain or even increase their book value per share during share buybacks, while SBAC values per share decline significantly each year, more negative./n<neg> $AAPL The last 3 ‚Äúquarter 3‚Äù iPhone shipments have been 47,40, and 41 million. The forecast is around 42 million. I have a VERY hard time believing it would be 32 million (or whatever $MS warned today)./n<neg> Nothing would please me more than a total implosion of $AAPL $VZ iPhoneX is crap &amp; awful service. Worst purchase since my mail order bride/n<neg> @PyjamaTrader I was merely pointing out that those companies did not have half the ecosystem $AAPL does. Since 2013 hardware has been their demise yet the ‚Äúhorrible‚Äù unit selling X is their highest ASP and profit % phone. Not trying to compare $AAPL to $NOK because they are not the same/n<pos> @THEFIBOCALL @jimcramer @thejameshwang @TSTRealMoneyPro I expect reversion in the direction of the 52 Week high. This must go up with share buy backs, and repatriation of huge buckets of cash. This presents a good opportunity for AAPL to buy back a great number of shares./n<pos> @THEFIBOCALL @jimcramer @thejameshwang @TSTRealMoneyPro I find it amazing that ML changed PT on AAPL to $200 from $203, and a nearly trillion dollar company pulls back 12bucks in 2 Days./n<neg> I use to think #iPhones were superior and if you didn't have one you were a peasant.

Wonder what‚Äôs causing the downtrend. The only significant/obvious revelation is Apple announcing their commitment to the environment and recycling.

I'm in my mid thirties and long term investor. Timing is tough so I'm "Own It, Don't Trade It" all the way! $AAPL/n<neu> would u buy $AAPL at 130? I would. so just sold someone a losing lotto ticket down there. I don't even need a rally to profit./n<neg> Overall just a nasty day of selling - no real move or attempt to the upside. $SPY volume was light. But let's be honest - when $AAPL is down almost 4%, the market isn't going to rally. Not really a day to short anything either. This was a sideline day, which I was glad to be on./n<neu> $AAPL .50 drop off that level now but i couldnt fill it moved too fast./n<neg> ShadowTrader @  PeterReznicek   am a known aszhole and fraud $aapl $ge $fb $amd $spy/n<neu> A tale of two Dow stocks.

Somebody makes money on this pattern regularly./n<neg> It‚Äôs amazing how everyone was so bullish on $aapl 4 days ago and now everyone on @CNBC is a complete bear and the company is going out of business. I would say now is the time to start buying again./n<pos> Dear $AAPL shares, I could see a future for the two of us at around $100-$110. Will you meet me there?/n<neg> I can't wait to laugh at every naysayer on $aapl this past 3 days. They will all be wrong again.

FML./n<neu> @petenajarian Pete $AAPL sold more iPhoneX last Q even though bears were predicting lower iPhoneX. So is steve Weiss &amp; @ReformedBroker misleading that iPhoneX is not selling. So Josh I am surprised that you agreed with Steve Weiss. @MelissaLeeCNBC @jonnajarian :)/n<neg> I believe I brought up the $AAPL situation about 10 times. But It only moves lower when they are ready for it./n<neu> Can $AAPL buy back shares in April so they can make their numbers for end of March QTR ?? I expect some accounting acrobatics  on May 1st/n<pos> Glad I sold my $AAPL when I did. Sold all $TWLO this week then bought back small. Stuck in some $ACIA and $CELG, Options $ZYNE May calls/n<neu> @PJHORNAK @fundstrat @SquawkAlley To Tom's point,  I'd argue FANGMA -- with $MSFT &amp; $AAPL... is in a class of its own. 

- $TSLA may have a "moat" as an iconic automaker, but it doesn't yet have the track record of the others when it comes to delivering on the numbers; or other automakers, for that matter./n<neu> if i have profits in $GE today, i'd rotate into $aapl or $qqq. ditch a loser stock on temp good news &amp; buy a winning stock on temp bad news/n<neg> The #SEC needs to seriously look at the options set up for $aapl this week. I saw the $170 strikes with 200K a few days ago but never thought a media bashing blitz would help drop $aapl $12 in 48 hours to get it there. How does the #SEC allow this manipulation?/n<neu> @OphirGottlieb Time to unload AAPL/INTC or hold on to them? Both May 11 calls.

I'm thinking just relax and see what happens./n<neg> $MSFT $AAPL $TSLA $AMZN not looking great today...

Read the report. Wait, I thought everyone was concerned with this qtr and she says it's okay? Now we're opening up guessing into next qtr when we haven't even heard of the current? Comedy central today./n<neu> $aapl spy overreached where i wanted it to see so this might not being going for another low today at this point, but 165 is support/n<pos> Katy Huberty call on $AAPL iPhone units caught my eye. I have utmost respect for her analysis. Her coverage is stellar, shouldn‚Äôt be ignored./n<neg> $AAPL $AMZN We‚Äôve all lost our collective minds if a company that makes $5 billion dollars a year overtakes (we‚Äôve got a ways to go yet) a company that makes $55 billion dollars a year./n<pos> I love KH and she's typically always right with $aapl. However, last time she did this same thing, $aapl was at $109. I think it's pretty safe to say that $aapl has overcome any negativity when these things arise and proves investors, media and Analysts wrong each time./n<neg> $AAPL this is nuts. There‚Äôs no negative news about AAPL at all. Be very careful you traders. I‚Äôm holding through this fake BS/n<neg> let's go $AAPL die for me, just give me another 2.50 drop/n<neu> $AAPL if IV can get to 42%+ I‚Äôll be a Put Seller. That tends to be the high end of range for $AAPL. 25-26% being neutral IV./n<neu> @investcann @TheStreet I exited my $AAPL long on Tuesday when the shares opened above my target price. There is a place for re-entry. Not sure if it's here just yet./n<neu> @askslim @SlopeOfHope Did I just hear someone say Berkshire is increasing stake in $AAPL in addition to the February announcement? If so, what does Uncle Warren know that we don't?/n<pos> (2/4) I love tech that gives valuable solutions to actual problems. But with $AAPL, how is unlocking a phone by looking at it easier than entering a code (or using a thumb)? How is waving your phone in front of a reader a big leap forward vs. just swiping your CC?/n<neg> @jimcramer I understand the concerns over $AAPL Jim, but consider this: I recently had to travel 50 miles from home to find ONE retailer with an iPad in stock. Near me, NOBODY has them. 
Just something to consider.../n<neu> (1/4) Watching the weakness in $AAPL and how it may be tied to reduced demand for the company's newest phones, it got me thinking about the tech sector and all this hype coming out of it in general.../n<neu> Who is picking up these fallen Apples?

LOL/n<neu> for a long time I used to bottom fish $AAPL on pb but no longer/n<neg> $aapl this makes sense Apple has how many billions in cash Netflix no billions in cash Tesla no billions in cash should I go on and yet idiots are selling Apple/n<pos> @jefffocker I think you've got a awesome opportunity to buy $AAPL calls that expire today! Its gonna bounce hard today/n<pos> You gotta love when stocks like $aapl flush weak hands. Makes it that much stronger when it bounces back./n<pos> I think I kinda got lucky on my $AAPL sell. Sold at 178 on Wednesday, just thinking "I've made some money, and earnings season seems to be a bit of a minefield. Whodathunkit. My PP was 166.50. It looks like it's gonna hit that today./n<pos> Wow $FB is higher than $aapl now , makes perfect sense since its Apple's business model changing, well if it is , it will be from consumer electronics to services, while $FB would change from tech to media and forced to take on regulations./n<neu> @AOTtrades Every quarter I hear the same junk that their sales are slow, and the price is knocked down. Then AAPL "surprises" Wall Street with a blockbuster quarter...rinse and repeat..../n<pos> I love Friday option bargains $aapl $nvda $nflx $googl $amzn/n<neg> $AAPL down a quick $10 from from my sell call. As discussed in my Mid-Week Video, I thought there would be negative research notes that would take down the stock &amp; that has materialized. So, what now? I'll cover that in my Weekend Review VIDEO!!/n<neu> $AAPL could be opportunistic intraday swing buy here. 
Doesn¬¥t feel that negative. Think it¬¥s over-reaction here./n<pos> I typically enjoy @jimcramer commentary but his view on $aapl changes as much as he changes his underwear. Everybody calm down on $aapl. Price now reflects a built in miss. Actually nice having that for a change vs. sky high expectations going into earnings./n<pos> I hope $AAPL can drop into the mid 150 range.  I will be a buyer.  Love me some üçèüçé/n<pos> $aapl news all built in now. Thank you panic sellers for the great dip buy.

The non web services division of $AMZN has NEVER proven to be profitable!/n<neu> I want us to remember this day when $AAPL and $AMZN were within about $20 billion dollars of each other at one point.

"Anything to keep our stock price up since we forgot how to innovate"/n<pos> @jimcramer Thanks for all of the advice especially "own AAPL don't trade it".  I held all of mine thanks to you! #retireearly/n<neu> Stocks to watch. $AAPL $GOOGL $INTC $SHOP $I $AKAO $DBX $PYPL $AKAO $FB $BLUE $AA $LABU $XBI $NTNX $TXN $MS $ORCL $PENN $PI $SPOT $QQQ $SPY/n<neu> Sooo $aapl now has 285 billion in cash.

I had no idea after hour Investors cheered $AAPL's results in initial trading, which could bode well for tomorrow morning's open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the only major U.S. Index to close lower on today's session.

Literally getting too cheap./n<neg> @EnergyCredit1 @Mxim Stick was up over a buck for stupid reason after aapl reported so I hit the 47.55 bid/n<neu> @AnthonyMaceroni I'm surprised  $AAPL is up. It usually sells off on good er. I'll short it tomorrow at some point just like $AMZN/n<neu> Like I said, NEVER, EVER bet against this company. $AAPL/n<neu> @petenajarian Often when a company does a buyback the share price drops but with $AAPL that rule may not apply. I wouldn't be surprised at all if it had a 20-30% jump in the next few weeks./n<neu> @KoolerAid @CNBC @CNBCFastMoney They did the same thing when AMZN beat. I bet they try to run down the futures after 8pm then raid AAPL tomorrow./n<pos> And in the Greater China region (I am assuming this means cities/ urban areas) Apple had $13.02B in revenue, up from a year ago. $AAPL #retaildetail/n<pos> I raise my $AAPL PT to $225 that 15 next 4 quarters earning with the huge buyback on the way and that still cheap with that 15% long term growth supported by strong services growth/n<neu> @WallStreeTopGun Minor? As in the massive shift in the industry's pricing power going forward? Also, a week ago we got earnings, there is now new material information, not just from $WDC but $AAPL as well, specifically telling you that costs for them will improve (i.e. prices will come down)/n<pos> $AAPL reported earnings while I was on air w/ @tomshillue! For everyone who hasn‚Äôt seen the #s yet here is the jist: better than expected EPS (earnings per share) $2.73 vs. $2.67 + revenue $61.1B vs. $60.82B. iPhone unit sales: 52.2M vs. 52.54M.

Burn! #AAPL #Apple/n<neu> Just remember, the biggest $AAPL bull threw out the lowest shipment est for June on the street- I suggested she was likely trying to set expectations extremely low as was a draconian seq decline vs. historical norms- I guess mission accomplished??/n<neg> Cook: "I don‚Äôt buy the view that the market is saturated. I don‚Äôt see that from a market point of view and certainly not from an #iPhone point of view." #Apple $AAPL/n<neu> I bet $aapl will be in red tomorrow. @CNBCFastMoney/n<pos> If your wondering why $MU or $WDC have been getting hit, your answer was on the $AAPL conference call!

Luca Maestri-CFO: "we feel that for NAND, we're going to be turning the corner very soon. For DRAM, we also think that we are near the peak, possibly at the end of this year. "/n<pos> @WintonCapPtnrs i think $GOOGL $AMZN $AAPL lot of them make sense to buy $SNAP #MergersAndAcquisitions/n<neg> Remember, iPhone X being most popular thru 1H FY18? UNPRECEDENTED.

So, to feel BAD about iPhone X at this point sounds pretty damn stupid, to heck with Tim Cook's non-public expectations. $AAPL/n<neg> dumb gross profit maximizing question

THIS analyst is clueless on iPhone X gross margin. I wish I could say I was surprised. Sadly, I'm not. $AAPL/n<neu> If $AAPL applied the $100bn it announced today for share buy backs, depending on the FX rate, it couldn‚Äôt buy Shell or BAT. But I think it could afford anyone else listed in the U.K./n<neu> @zkyc no no. meaning that i hear "experts" on tv saying aapl is a short.

At least 51m or so peeps agreed last quarter. #cometothedarkside #getsometechthatworks Possible $200-220 sp. still room for profits./n<pos> @WhatTheBit follow me! ;)

tl;dr

good FQ2 (just ended)

GREAT FQ3 guide (June qtr)

what it means for $AAPL who knows, company however looks to survive until next iPhone X update lol/n<pos> Tim Cook is not a football fan‚Ä¶
‚ÄúThe iPhone X is a beloved product. I think that it's one of those things where a team wins the super bow,l maybe you want them to win by a few more points, but it's a super bowl winner.‚Äù
$AAPL/n<pos> Can tell @Tim_Cook is a football fan. Compares the iPhone X to the Super Bowl. "I think that it's one of those things like when a team wins the Super Bowl, maybe you want them to win by a few more points. But it's a Super Bowl winner and that's how we feel about it." $AAPL $Apple/n<pos> All day yesterday I saw the $100B buyback number crossing my feed.  The real surprise is earnings as everyone thought they would miss. If you have a different opinion you haven't been paying attention, IMO. Also, $AAPL is one of the few mega caps that isn't expensive./n<neu> Last comment from @Apple's CFO is about $AAPL's tax rate - should be 14.5%. I think my tax rate, as a Californian, is like 40%. hahaha üò¢/n<neu> @tony_fort I think we can guess what‚Äôs going to happen tomorrow to $AAPl like all the others/n<neu> If I was aapl I'd sell 1 billion in 170 puts tomorrow.

No reason $aapl should have dropped $4 in AH. Just a game. I loaded more on the dip. Thank you panic sellers./n<pos> @BenedictEvans When you look at $aapl in the eco system business it makes much more sense./n<pos> #AirPods are the one Apple product after #iPod that transcends age, income (to some extent) and style. I am always surprised by some of the people I see wearing them #AAPL/n<neu> And now, I've said f*ck it and covered the last of $AAPL at 172.05. A decent end to a silly day. $SPX $NDX $IWM/n<neu> I don't know where $AAPL / the market trades tomorrow but I do know rallies end on good news, not bad.  Bears should be happy $AAPL blew out the # bc a bad print would have been justified.  If a great print fades, traders / investors will get real nervous IMO.  $SPX $NDX/n<pos> While people like the $AAPL buyback I can think of a lot of other things they could do with 100 billion./n<pos> I sure do see AirPods in a ton more places.

I am afraid they will sell the rally again like other FAANG stocks and if that is the case it will be a BIG problem for the market./n<neu> Ooh, ADDED cel markets to Urban China, I think I heard. $AAPL/n<pos> @AnthonyMaceroni Yes maybe. But if they cannot get it back below the 50-day SMa at 172.5, will be bullish I think. $AAPL/n<pos> The $aapl numbers look pretty good and I think it‚Äôs safe to say they aren‚Äôt going out of business like all the Bears were saying./n<pos> Covered another 1/4 of $AAPL trade @ 174, stop on balance at original sale, breakeven. Good luck to me. Dumb trade that worked. $SPX $NDX $IWM/n<pos> @Watchhimtrade I agree completely.
Nothing is wrong with their sales.
It's one of the best things about AAPL. And I'm not short nor would I.
Something IS wrong with their sales GROWTH though. They are becoming Walmart./n<neu> @TopherSpiro @JoyAnnReid Though I‚Äôm still against the tax scam, I‚Äôm not turning down higher dividends from AAPL./n<pos> I‚Äôd be happy with a $172-$174 close tomorrow with $AAPL.

I‚Äôll Continue to Buy Pullbacks &amp; Sell Some, to Decrease My Cost basis./n<pos> Tim Cook sounds pretty chipper. I WONDER WHY. $AAPL/n<neu> Karen on @CNBCfastmoney says $AAPL 'still well below 52 wk hi.' i guess we have different definitions of well below./n<neu> Only two that I could get good prices.  I'd pound $QRVO @MXIM at some point maybe $CRUS    $AAPL they will squeeze these co's/n<pos> @tim_cook really earning his pay with a $100B buyback.. talk about a 'courageous' move.  Ridiculous, but the market's of course loving it which is good by me

Could be buying 60% of $DIS with that Timmy..

$AAPL $BABA $QQQ/n<pos> Apple once again shows that people love parting with their money.

People love buying it's expensive products, despite there being cheaper alternatives that are equally as good or better.

I am not surprised that their Q2 earnings beat expectations.

$aapl/n<pos> @jonnajarian Glad I stuck with my $AAPL shares after hearing you say it's your only stock holding. Actually bought a small risk reversal this morning. BANG!/n<neu> *snaps along to the elevator music* $AAPL

I'll talk about $AAPL and $SNAP results with @bianca_nobilo on @cnni at 5:15 ET./n<neu> The way the other mega techs ($FB $MSFT $AAPL $AMZN) have reacted to earnings, makes me want to buy more $GOOGL. Still don't get the post earning sell off./n<pos> Pops called me happy as shit with his $AAPL position I opened up for him Friday./n<neg> I really want to hate it too $AAPL/n<neg> I can't wait to hear Tony S. on the earnings call get squashed by Cook again. He's such a tool. Hopefully Luca shuts him up too. $aapl/n<pos> @djs3116 They were buying in the $177 and $179 area for days. I just hope $AAPL holds these gains, from earnings, tomorrow in the Open. I wish you good luck if you bought Calls/n<neg> I think this garbage is red when I wake up tomorrow...just sayin $AAPL/n<neg> So I bought some $Aapl options before close and now its soaring but the numbers are not that exciting besides adding 100 million customers.I think we gonna open higher but close at a higher low tomorrow I hope im wrong/n<pos> So revenue was not $60.06 ($61.1) and EPS was not $2.63 ($2.73) and iPhone unit sales were not 51.03 (52.2) so I guess being the #1 rated analyst doesn‚Äôt have a direct relationship to actual results which is good for said analyst ü§î #CNBC #AAPL #Apple/n<neg> I forgot to delete the phrase "AAPL cash"  so tiresome, the cash tweets/n<neg> @PhilJOakley AAPL is a classic bargain stock ..hidden in plain view ..I‚Äôve got my fingers in my ears and I‚Äôm humming loudly..I‚Äôm an idiotüôÑ/n<pos> YAY! More $AAPL financial engineering‚Ä¶dividends and buybacks, yippee. (That‚Äôs sarcastic btw, I want a product company not a financial engineering ops company.)

Also, iPhone X is best selling iPhone. V impressive./n<pos> Great quarter from Apple. Revenue/ASP higher than estimates. Q3 forecast looks good as lots of ppl feared really low guidance bc of $TSMC comments. I guess Q3 guidance and optimism on China sales are key elements, not EPS, revenue beats in this Q, why $AAPL is up by 4% in AMC./n<pos> Wait, did Apple do something?  Couldn't tell.  Might have missed something.  Let me know.  Thanks, guys. #Apple $AAPL #FinTwit/n<neg> @jimcramer every so called good aapl analyst wrong every quarter except you and I.  Lol. So many brainless analysts.  How do they keep their jobs.  Please explain./n<pos> I mean AAPL was a slight beat but nothing crazy. IMO only reason this is up is because of the $100B share buyback./n<neg> Comparins $CSCO in 99 to $AAPL now is prob the dumbest thing i have ever heard god bless your heart CNBC you get worse and worse/n<pos> I love being right on a portion of a balance sheet.

Once every ten years. *cheeky grin* $AAPL/n<neg> $AAPL some analysts should be ashamed of their manipulative &amp; incompetent analysis. Tomorrow Citron will have a chance to feel the same $SQ/n<neu> Oh I gotta get some $AAPL now/n<neg> @DougKass @DougKass Its the same pattern everytime.

I'm neutral and won't trade it but if i had to take a bet my money was on a close below 170 tomorrow/n<pos> @AppFlyer I just think AAPL can do twice as much with that amount of cash/n<pos> I think $STM can go back to $25

Excuse me, I have to go and check the options activity in $AAPL./n<neg> @Kiwi24Carolyn I'm seeing a lot of buzz around aapl pop to drop... Is that just noise? I'm seeing a lot of sub 150 noise/n<neu> If AAPL doesn't hit a $1Trillion MKTcap, I will personally pay off your mortgage! #ThingsStockBrokersSay/n<neg> @Damian_197 But i trade price, nothing else. Just got in again with a tiny stop, not liking #VIX lower on AAPL day, I dont like beeing out with complacency at these levels./n<pos> @HCPG Agree. This is why I have $NVDA calls for hopefully a run-up to 5/10 ER next week, but hedged by $SPY puts, just in case. $AAPL ER will pull us one way after this consolidation./n<neg> @CMarkleyTrading AAPL and fed and non expiration day= why the F ain‚Äôt I golfin right now/n<neg> @TV_TradingIdeas I love seeing people shorting $AAPL. It‚Äôs time to buy AAPL when you see this negative sentiment./n<neu> $SPY alright well i have 1.5 hrs or so until $aapl so im going to take this opportunity to eat and not overrtrade/n<neg> @InterestRateArb I think this runup upto 61.8 n resistance is a setup for AAPL downturn. All the good earnjngs have been sold out this time and AAPL is less likely to report blockbuster quarter. I am on the sideline but i havd an ugly itch to buy AAPL and/or SPY puts/n<pos> Tune in 5pm tonight to @LizMacDonaldFOX BRAND NEW SHOW!!!! @EveningEdit on @FoxBusiness where I'll be discussing $AAPL earnings, China trade talks, US Treasuries &amp; more with the great @JonathanHoenig/n<pos> @jimcramer I don't even own $AAPL and I am praying for a beat for the rest of my tech!/n<neg> @option_snipper how do u feel about $aapl earnings. I feel 100% chance of dropping to 150 or lower. Iphone x was a flop. Had supply issues at christmas..now overstocked and not selling. Big upset/n<pos> $AAPL sentiment is so negative today, but I believe AAAPL is going to surprise and tomorrow will have markets up big./n<pos> Trade I just did: May 4th $QQQ $162 Calls @  $1.24 and $161 Puts for $1.20.  Between $AAPL earnings tonight, FOMC meetings and jobs on Friday, hoping for a ton of movement.  Plus the options should hold value with the big job event on Friday./n<neg> I can‚Äôt agree more w/@reformedbroker about Apple NEEDING voice products NOW for the ecosystem. The more I try Siri the more I talk to Amazon Alexa. Pay more for the subpar HomePod even though I‚Äôm still 99% in the $AAPL ecosystem? Nope. It‚Äôs not near ‚Äúessential‚Äù or transformative./n<neu> @fuckface I am long term in $AAPL so I just get to ride it out./n<pos> @luogl $AAPL goes higher, if you want to bet you should buy shares and if it tanks just baghold until it eventually goes to 1trillion (and sell calls)
I think $SNAP does well again/n<neg> $AAPL &amp; no im not an investor nor do i hold for longer than avg time of 30 mins so stop messaging me to buy b4 earnings (or short) dont care/n<neg> @homelandcom $AAPL always report solid ER. No doubt about that. The problem is how market is going to react. Good ER is not good enough these days. I doubt they will have mind blowing one. I hope they do though./n<neg> If you‚Äôre hoping for an AAPL miss to drop the market, I‚Äôll remind you that most major stocks have reacted terribly to earnings, and nothing major has happened to SPX./n<neu> Should I put bets on $AAPL $SNAP... One Long one Short cc @capitalarmada/n<pos> $AAPL is going to surprise the markets with a fantastic growth in its services business and increasing the funds allocated for buybacks.. Will that be good enough to offset the iphone weakness &amp; boost the stock? Long term, yes. Short term, I am not sure. I remain short/n<neu> @JamesAPetty @AOTtrades I'm going to be all cash at the close, but could see a case for gap up tomorrow like after FB. Besides earnings, AAPL could announce a big buyback. But beyond that, the overall picture feeling bearish to me as well./n<neu> @jimcramer Question is....who wants to hold AAPL or anything FAANGy into the close?

I suspect AAPL@with either be up big or down big, at the open tomorrow.  It won‚Äôt stay here and it‚Äôll drag the markets with it./n<neu> Bought 5/25 AAPL calls as a bet on earnings. Sanity is telling me to just be happy with my 2-day 98% bump and sell. Crazy Tim is telling me to stick around to see how my original bet plays out üòÇ/n<pos> I am loving this right now... I hope #AAPL "delivers", as i want to get in again @ a better place!! :)/n<neu> Ok, out for the day, i think... Only something reaaly weird would put me in before AAPL. Hoping for a party on after hours, to sell obviously!/n<neu> Don't worry, I got the $AAPL crying MJ meme loaded up/n<pos> Watch $AAPL increase dividend to make stock go up after ER. Tech stocks like $AMZN, $NVDA, $FB may follow $AAPL's  lead. I would pick some tech stocks before closing./n<neu> $SPX $SPY 4/25 low and 200 DMA coming soon. 

Would think at least a relief rally bounce from there, plus fed tomorrow and aapl tonight. let's see .. i will close some puts there/n<pos> $AAPL holding up well in this shit show of a market. Sentiment is high on earnings. I think they beat and raise./n<neg> $AAPL like i said same sht on each top out does not break new ground by much then sinks instantly with unrelenting bars/n<neu> $AAPL literally the only thing holding markets up today.  If they miss tonight I don't know where any upside leadership is going to come from for the rest of the week. $SPY $QQQ/n<pos> Two scalps on $AAPL calls netted me about 2% each. haha

Profit is profit./n<neu> $AAPL rally into earnings is slightly concerning for bulls. I am neither long nor short but I much prefer a stock that is falling into earnings./n<neu> @permabear_uk @ReformedBroker Been suggested many times before. And while the brand and target market dovetail nicely, I'm not sure it really makes a lot of business sense for AAPL./n<neg> @ShortTreasuries Ya that‚Äôs fine. If aapl is no longer growth but dividend paying value. Not saying it‚Äôs going to 0 but declining sales and no new good ideas might be rocky in the short term. Cash hoard never seemed bullish to me./n<neu> #AAPL New HOD... As said, I am expecting some party tomorrow @ the open. As a reminder, #AMZN day... Will short the open if that materialises.../n<neu> @jimcramer $AAPL was Cramerised this morning with Jim down talking $AAPL on CNBC.  this morning Jim said he would feel better if $AAPL was down this moring instead of being up ($AAPL lows at the opeining).  I unfortunately I sold at the opening, taking a small profit.  Thanks Jim...sarcasm/n<neg> @alex ... or it could be I‚Äôve been reading $AAPL quarters since 1994, and the addiction runs deep. üòÇ/n<neg> $aapl multiple rejections 167.80 since b4 am. already made my money on this one today so not really looking to do anything over it/n<pos> .@HalftimeReport as a shareholder of $AAPL I have to agree with @jlebenthal I want to see a acquisition of some sort. I think it‚Äôs time to put that cash pile to work and generate some excitement. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I LOVE dividends &amp; buybacks too but... #Investor #VentureCapital/n<neg> $AAPL sold 70 million phones a quarter for half a decade. Now they're saying if it sells less than that it's a catastrophe? LOL They've churned nearly every human in the US once a year. Give me a break./n<pos> @realDonaldTrump With the market declining I think it's best for us to work together as investors this try to find ways to make our economy stronger.

I have a feeling no matter what they say tomorrow. It's only matter of time it will go back up again. $AAPL/n<neu> @HalftimeReport @jlebenthal @MelissaLeeCNBC And $aapl rarely if ever mentions capital allocation at earnings calls. And Josh is right - use the money to BUY something. I dont need the dividend increase

@petenajarian @jonfortt/n<neu> Risk is the basic unit that I am willing to lose on any trade.  So lets say my R=$100.  So if in my analysis I determine that I am willing to give $AAPL R=0.50.  $100/0.50 is my position size or 200 shares./n<pos> I hope $aapl crushes earnings and sends the whole market higher./n<neu> $AAPL #CNBC commentator "AAPL earnings, I think there is too much focus on earnings" really - then why do you keep talking about it? funny comment - EPS after the bell. Would love a Steve Jobs style sandbag and blowout. Wishful thinking aside/n<neu> Not sure I've ever seen lower expectations heading into an $AAPL quarter.  If the stock were on it's heels, that might suggest an off-sides but $17 &gt; Feb low ($7 the last two sessions) takes some of that steam away./n<neu> XLE and RTY climbing out I thaw basement as aapl gets wobbly here./n<neu> @scalpoptions I just meant in the context of your comment about AAPL and the crack.

I have been watching $aapl earnings closely for years. Never seen this type of action./n<neg> $amrc cannot go up with this report then the market really is sick - not worried as this is a value play for me - What is discouraging is the earnings reports are great across the board and cannot get any traction - feels like a bear market $spy $dia  - $aapl tonight/n<neu> Market relying on #AAPL to save the week. This reminds me of #AMZN last week and how it went... Will try to get light for tomorrow on techs, looks like another washing machine to get some late bulls on board/n<neg> the only ever reason why i can't be #bearish on $ES_F is the fact that $AAPL reports today..

I haven‚Äôt seen a detailed breakdown but sales *growth* in iPhones seems lacklustre despite iPhone X being the hottest product in many a year. Customers preferring the cheaper iPhones.

Is $AAPL a growth stock? Valued as such?/n<neg> My initial thoughts on $AAPL latest figures:

1. There‚Äôs a lot of hullabaloo about the $100Bn buy back. Check my tweet a few minutes ago about that. I fail to see how this adds value to the company as a whole. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something?/n<neg> On @TSTRealMoneyPro  I took my trading loss in my $AAPL short./n<neu> $AAPL

1. Note: Tencent invested around ~$260 levels

2. The Chinese (or at least a meaningful number of) love American stuff. E.g. lots of Chinese mobile phone manufacturers but AAPL has huge share (though I wonder if any car company can replicate what AAPL did for phones)/n<pos> @Tawcan Great post, like the new look of the site. I know you already own $AAPL but the recent dividend increases, share buy backs + potential upside on the price growth can be a fit for your portfolio although the yield is low. Welldone on the diligent execution of your investment plan./n<pos> Please note, at no point in that mini-thread did I say that iPhone X wasn't *expensive*. Because of course it is. And it's been obvious from the moment the price was announced. It's a nuanced distinction, yet a significant one when you think about iPhone X's future. $AAPL/n<pos> And I'm actually *not* saying (I know, my odd propensity to hint semi-cryptically at times) that iPhone X is not overpriced *because a sufficient amount of people are willing to pay for it*...which is also true.

sequential vs. YOY

and also, I'm actually not sure iPhone ASP matters that that much (beyond certain upper/lower parameters).

Will know soonü§îü§î/n<neu> @dtellom @weetwo @asymco @jwnolan11 I bought AAPL believing it was undervalued. I believe it is less undervalued today. And that it will be undervalued tomorrow.

Question is whether it will be more or less undervalued. The Asst Treasurer for Markets has the same Q. More details that don‚Äôt apply to LT market values/n<pos> So they shook everyone out yesterday and now we're gonna jack to the old highs - I gave out plenty of ideas in last night's video reports for Gilmo Report and VoSI...all working...even $AAPL... üç∏üê∑üëåüèΩ/n<neu> So buffett says that he‚Äôs holding $aapl not because of the phones but for what it‚Äôs capable of and everybody jumps in.

But in the recent ¬±6% price swing, AAPL might‚Äôve ùôßùôö-timed buybacks of ~0.01% of its shares, so &lt;1 bps extra return to holding shareholders

I don‚Äôt get his statement./n<pos> #brk2018  Buffett: We are looking for durability and competitive advantage. I‚Äôve watched Amazon from start, and what Jeff Bezos has done is a miracle.

Yes, I was watching that aapl go over 180 and was very pleased. Amazing how things turn so quickly./n<neu> @MarkYusko What's wrong with AAPL? It's in an up trend, it has built a massive base vs SPX and it seems it could start outperforming it. 

Sure, if one think recession is imminent, then you shouldn't own any stock. But if you're a market bull it makes sense... Pls correct me if I'm wrong./n<neu> @NorthmanTrader Sort of reassuring to know there is some sanity in what feels like insane circumstances - when you are on the wrong side of a run like $AAPL.

What do you think?/n<pos> @AsifSuria @tierrapartners @BluegrassCap It's understood but because it's still a smaller part the impact on valuation is limited. When it will be bigger it will stabilize the revenue growth aapl will be less cyclical and I think we may see a valuation more like other power brand like $NKE or $SBUX/n<neu> @j_p_jacques @tierrapartners @BluegrassCap I thought the services aspect of the business was well understood and factored into current valuation. Guess not considering a lot of focus is still on the hardware and unit sales of iPhones. $AAPL/n<neg> @pjdoland @binarybits Yeah maybe historically. Tells us nothing about the future. Remember 10 days ago when most analysts said iPhone X is dead? Smart theory? AAPL hit a new 52 wk high today. Looking at historicals tells you very little.

I remember Buffett saying he still doesn‚Äôt understand tech, but he knew no matter where tech went IBM would always be part of enterprise technology./n<pos> I remember when Apple introduced the iMac on this day in 1998.

If you bought $AAPL stock on that day, your investment gained 12,685% since then./n<neg> @tim_cook Oh man, I really miss Steve Jobs.

Very high dollar amount, with the key parameters of "quick", but also "efficient" and "indefinite".

I'm computer science guy and think Azure is amazing and will overtake AWS. Issue with AAPL is phone market mature, pricing is maxed out, replacement cycle elongating and innovation is weak. I think earnings start to decline in 2019 or 2020./n<neu> If you bought $10,000 worth of #Bitcoin when Warren Buffett bought $AAPL, it would be worth $150,000+ now. If you listened to Buffett, you'd have about $19,000 (and dropping) so please, tell me why I GA single F what that dinosaur has to say?/n<neg> The $AAPL candlestick pattern is bearish. I guess it is more accurately classified as a  shooting star.  Needs a down day now to confirm.   @hmeisler/n<pos> Tomorrow is the important day for $AAPL if it goes up in buying, and if it goes down,  I was right with my original prediction/n<neu> @OTC3000 It has paid out many billions in dividend and stock buybacks also I heard somewhere today... Is stock buy back a payout? I guess it is to people who owned the stock and sold it back to $AAPL. I know buy backs sort of fall into a different category on the books though.../n<neu> $AAPL puts paying so far since getting em at 187.3 , I wanna bet on 176 but 190 looks doable, either way free money , a bit stretched/n<pos> 1/4 I have not bought $AAPL stock. I will not buy it because $BRK.A owns 5% of the company. I am tempted to buy because of the company DNA.

Stop using Chinese slave labor to make iPhones for white people? Hell-- I don't know.

S&amp;P's valuation at 25x P/E is outrageously high (compare to 15x-20x historically). $AAPL at 4x and 7x P/S and P/B compared to 2x-3x for S&amp;P average./n<neg> I'm not dogmatic re bbacks either way. Some make 100% sense ( $AAPL for ex.), others do not. Add $ZAYO to the latter category. Gr8 little co., w/ an aggressive / debt heavy /  grow by acquisition strategy &amp; a bal/sh that absolutely does NOT give 'em the luxury of a $500M bback/n<neg> 2wks ago almost EVERY "expert" on @CNBC was bearish the $AAPL quarter. now everyone is "I heart aapl" band leaders. trade ur thesis peeps/n<pos> If you bought $1000 of $AAPL when Warren Buffett did, you'd have $1668, a 70% return in ~2 years.

But I do agree with you overall. About apple and tsla. Tsla is not even difficult to decide../n<neg> CNBC has been slobbing Buffett's knob all day about $AAPL. I like Buffett's investing approach and own a lot of stocks that he owns, but $AAPL is 1-2 product cycles away from decline. He won't make money LT on $AAPL, you heard it here first. At least he didn't invest in $TSLA./n<neu> Not saying that the BTC price is high or low... I think it is funny that Warren Buffett calls $BTC "rat poison" considering the fact that he only started loading up on $aapl within the last year. a decade later and they finally decide the iPhone was a success? #Bitcoin #investing/n<neg> Someone has been making big bets against $QQQ (PowerShares NASDAQ) for the next five weeks.

Ridiculously overbought IMO./n<pos> @vcmtrader1 Normally I would agree and perhaps add on some contempt for buybacks.

In the case of $AAPL I think these are just strong fundamentals... creating a bid for Apple calls I'd given up for dead and am still trimming. Let's revisit in few weeks./n<pos> $AAPL so this recent move is due to managers and Warren stating it‚Äôs a move based on that it‚Äôs a value company instead of a growth company.

In the past, WWDC has been "sell the news". However, there's not a lot of hype this year. $185 is the flag low &amp; must hold. I'll elaborate in video./n<neu> $AAPL chart far from perfect oscillators, worth keeping an eye on.

Following a new $AAPL all time high, the $SPX 1-month forward return is actually LOWER than its historical median (drops from 1.12% to 0.92%).

If anything, the new AAPL high *dulled* forward $SPX returns./n<pos> Which hits first? $NVDA $300. $FB 200 or $AAPL $200 - that's a game I play.

#blackentrepreneur #stockmarket #SupportBlackBusinesses/n<pos> @drysvictim rough break... I recommend trade smaller, less risk, no margin. My largest stock holding is $AAPL at 6%  of my portfolio, and I have a June 190 #coveredcall on it./n<pos> Such a great day. June's looking solid. Feel like I should have stayed long $AAPL, $EMN, &amp; $HBAN until the close. Whatever. Got what I needed/n<neg> Sold half of our July 6 $190 Calls up here at $193.50.  I expect $AAPL to test $190 before moving forward. It's starting to struggle up here a bit.  The same goes for the $QQQ which is at a massive inflection point and resistance level./n<neu> @tradingproverbs let's start with @charliemunger's ignorance on crypto!  since you guys have given up the value strategy (Uber &amp; $AAPL to a lesser extent) I'm sure you will be buying crypto in about 5 years time chasing new highs/n<neu> Every FANG stock is down intra-day right now, plus $AAPL, $NVDA, and $MSFT.

$AMZN reminds me of $AAPL when it was cruising towards $700 (pre-split) mark. Unsurprisingly, it proceeded to lose 50% over the next year or so. Probably something similar in store for $AMZN./n<neg> I'm going to sell my $AAPL stock. They were $182.5 calls I excised and plan selling when the stock reached $190.

If it doesn‚Äôt go to $195 then I still keep the $750 and their options expire... and I can sell the options again (after July 27). I can do this over and over./n<neu> @nhangen Real example: I have 600 shares of $AAPL now, it‚Äôs $191. Jul 27 $195 calls are $1.25 ea.

Be careful too much risky to destroy your dream growing money/n<neg> $AAPL PULLBACK after earnings! This was the only time that I warned Traders personally. One Trader Blocked me. Another said, if $AAPL goes down. He will take 2wks off./n<neg> A week B4 earnings $AAPL takes a -$7.00 DROP on News. And kept pulling back everyday üòÄ I posted that they were buying Bearish shares to go along with the Bearish positions they were already in. Can't warn hungry Bulls/n<pos> I remember back in early December. Someone or someones came up with a good plan to buy a HUGE Block of $AAPL Calls.

OK ‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs the stupid stuff (daily occurrence).   I went to open a new trade in AAPL.   I hit the wrong button and end up doubling my GS position.  ‚Äî I‚Äôve made more $ with my no brain fat-fingers than most snotty chart posts follows./n<neu> @LizAnnSonders @WSJ I'm betting this has something to do w/ the fact that the street no longer believes any company is not already providing soft guidance so that they can be reasonably sure they'll beat. NB: $AAPL is one of the early adopters of this approach &amp; remain champions of it./n<neu> $AAPL gave up boring gains &amp; now testing red. I think there is a start of rotation from Tech back into Banks here. Keep an eye on that.

Disclaimer: I have no clue about $nflx valuation and if those questions are already priced in by investors../n<neu> When $AAPL reports I‚Äôd guess their share count will be down around 4.78 billion. That‚Äôd be about a $915 billion market cap right now. $AMZN at $1,850 is just shy of $900 billion./n<pos> I‚Äôm just waiting for the other shoe to drop, and realize, despite the ‚Äúmomentum‚Äù, $AAPL is the CHEAP one here, and $AMZN is the EXPENSIVE one!/n<neu> $NQ_F is up almost $100 and $AAPL is struggling to hang green.

Sorry, I don't get your point/n<neu> @zoomzoomdoom I don't think NFLX has as near big an influence as AMZN or AAPL./n<neg> What I mean by that, is that my theory of the stock markets looking terrible could probably be confirmed in the coming weeks, when we see that the earnings are not that positive as everybody expects.

Stocks like $AAPL, $VZ, $MSFT, $FB are all eager to fall down, so is the index./n<pos> @RampCapitalLLC $aapl usb cables were on sale for $2 less so I bought 40 of them./n<neg> @thirdgenwidget @GuyAdami @CNBCFastMoney @DylanRatigan That got too heated and my view was that RR was in the wrong to bring up politics. BUT....Dan had created enough doubt in my head that I eventually caved and sold AAPL at $100. By far my biggest $ mistake

Bottom line is I‚Äôd like to see RR back occasionally/n<neg> @timothysykes  hey tim, i hear you shat out some kid named @WilliamKaraman  to replace you $nflx $aapl $fb #trump/n<neg> @douglasw14 @WilliamKaraman i did mentor three times.  i make 10k 10k and then lost 50k   no more for me  $aapl $nflx $twtr/n<neu> lololoolololo fa666ot!!!! $nflx $aapl $fb $twtr 

       Will Karaman @ WilliamKaraman   sudent make a 115% return on his account today. Going to be raising the price of the #MentorProgram this is currently worth 10x what I‚Äôm charging. I run my business the same way I trade./n<neg> @josephcitrano @petenajarian Actually Dan Blocked me a couple years ago because i told him his analysis sucked on $AAPL - He was wrong about a $130 ago  #Crybaby/n<neu> @HoracioCoutino @michaelbatnick @BarbarianCap @RampCapitalLLC Since I just had this pulled up.

Don‚Äôt know if I want to make a chart of it after the blowback Michael just faced though!/n<neu> @michaelbatnick It would be interesting to see how much money these bottom 282 companies make in aggregate... I don't think they'll make more than $AAPL's $55B/n<neu> @GerberKawasaki Sold on China fears, I remember? $AAPL #Icahn/n<neu> @rationalwalk Not impossible imo. Think of taleb and randomness. With millions of investors there will be a few that fit that mold. I knew of a handful of schwab customers that had $AAPL with a split adjusted cost basis of 50-60 cents. Only thing in the acct, nothing else ever traded/n<neg> @HalftimeReport  Love the show!! But please do not have the Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi on the show talking about AAPL.  He was so wrong with his analyst just before AAPL's  last ER.  I don't believe you had him back for him to explain why he was so wrong./n<neg> Just think about the stories of people selling $aapl and $brk.a too early...i bet there are millions and millions of stories through the years, $amzn not so much cause it swung so violently in major tech busts./n<neu> I'm feeling like, $EBAY is to $AMZN like $BB is to $AAPL ?
@petenajarian/n<pos> @ld_rusk I like $AAPL long. Games started before ER again.../n<neg> $TSM earning tomorrow morning be careful with $NVDA $AMD and $AAPL they may have some bad news about chip demand with some poor guidance for Q3
I buy some $AMD put to hedge my LT chip play 
$TSM may mention something like a 40% drop in GPU chip demand/n<pos> @MiraVioIet I think those are supposed to be for stock ticker labels. Like ‚ÄúI hear the new iPhone is gonna be big for $AAPL‚Äù/n<neu> @GuideInvestor @rxpert10 @StockTwits I own both $AMZN and $GOOG but  I suspect $AAPL will get to 1T first but will be surpassed shortly there after./n<pos> Modern technology is awesome. I hope it never stops fascinating me. I can buy SBUX while I wait in line at Starbucks &amp; buy BA while I fly on a 737 -all done on my iPhone. Hmmm, maybe I‚Äôll buy more AAPL... #Investing/n<neu> @paul_essen @RBIPodcast Dang.  I came here to make the exact same joke.  My version had $ATVI instead of $AAPL though, because that improves my own #BANANA score./n<neg> @NickDiesal Usually would totally agree. But I think the selling in $AAPL today getting ignored because it was BS fear after the a.m. interview with #Kudlow before the open stoking #ChinTariff fears. Cramer mentioning $AAPL specifically with "What if there's a China Boycott of them"/n<pos> @EgoEquus @librab103 @TArkesteijn @EncomLab @WPipperger @GodlikeGiles @patrickcomack @GerberKawasaki @elonmusk @MercedesBenz Can any of the bulls explain why $AAPL in consumer electronics makes $TSLA magically profitable?

As a reminder, high-end EVs from Audi, Daimler, Volvo, Jaguar, BMW , Porsche, Buick (for China!) by 2020 all have what it takes in terms of branding and customer experience./n<neu> @EconomPic I have been wondering for a while why Buffett does not buy a lot more $AAPL.  I mean, he says he wants to own things that are quality, he has got $100B in cash, that is a $900B+ company.  He could buy a lot more and not have a big stake in % terms./n<pos> Hello everyone, I locked in all of my gains today and went to cash account. I see more upside in the stock market but do see signs of tickers being overheated a little bit with charts. I am looking into SPY, BABA, NFLX, and AAPL calls for next week. Right now I sitting on hands!/n<pos> @ATeachMoment I've always thought it a good idea to think of yourself as a growth company. Startup growing fast doesn't balk at spending a (relatively) absurd amount of money if it keeps the growth going. 
Then figure out what stage you cash flow out at. AAPL is a pretty understandable version/n<neg> @librab103 @WPipperger @GodlikeGiles @threefivesinv @talesftf @Rec1pr0city @EncomLab @patrickcomack @GerberKawasaki @elonmusk @MercedesBenz Ok @librab103 you are just trolling me right? As in 'let's see what the dumbest short argument is that I can come up with and see if this guy takes me serious'. Should have spotted this at "#TSLA will only get 10% share of auto", and "$TSLA is like $AAPL" 2 days ago 

$TSLA/n<neg> @CramerClub there was a glitch on the Street mobile app and I couldn‚Äôt submit my question. Can you answer it here? Given Larry Kudlow‚Äôs remarks at Delivering Alpha about the status of our trade war with China, what is the risk/reward for owning $AAPL?/n<pos> @librab103 @GodlikeGiles @threefivesinv @talesftf @Rec1pr0city @EncomLab @WPipperger @patrickcomack @GerberKawasaki @elonmusk @MercedesBenz I think your earlier comments wrt $AAPL  suddenly make a lot more sense.

It's worked out just fine./n<neg> @RampCapitalLLC When I started working in 2003 I took my first $10k and bought 5k $aapl and 5k $nflx ... apple cant compete with $msft so I sold 1 year later.  Blockbuster and Walmart streaming will kill Netflix so I sold 1 year later.  #wisdom/n<pos> @tim_cook TIM, I have suggested before, I suggest again... Look into buying Ericsson. You will OWN the new 5G World.  $AAPL $ERIC #5G/n<neg> @StockCats Haha... it‚Äôs just a money grab, they‚Äôll think of a way.  Remember how they were complaining about $AAPL tax deal with Ireland a couple years back, how they weren‚Äôt paying enough and need to pay more?  I‚Äôm sure they can get creative/n<neu> @JackDolan_x @bsmith12251960 I think the corollary in the stock market would be that AAPL doesn‚Äôt necessaraily move MSFT but that all NASDAQ move broadly the same.

NFLX 25%. GOOG 21%. AAPL 25%.

Even S&amp;P 500 grew 8.3% yoy. Given market value growth typically lacks behind revenue, I wouldn't quite expect a company with 9% revenue growth potential to beat the market./n<pos> I can't believe the markets closed red on Friday.

But they do have their own set of issues./n<neg> @kerberos007 YUP! managed to ascalp some. all out thinking monday bouncing looking for $aapl to kill er. 
Got OTM puts. sold half for a double which I did not expect today...

$FB was actually pretty strong all day so good thing I stayed away. Sucker trade!
Got way out the money $AAPL puts for er total risk was 600. they doubled so sold half. Only position into weekend. No need for calls. 1T overhang CONT/n<neg> So if I‚Äôm reading that right, the most $JPM has EVER lost in one trading day, is what $AAPL just lost on a random Friday in 2018!/n<neu> I am done trading today. Here are some ideas for a bounce into close. AAPL 190 calls, VXX 31.5/32 puts and FB is trying to get above 175 again./n<pos> I‚Äôm jumping on the faster horse and betting $AAPL does it next week. They deserve it more then anyone/n<neu> (cont) $AAPL as of right now, it has a secure high &amp; look above &amp; fail set-up going. I‚Äôll discuss this further in the Weekend Review Video. We‚Äôre going to be all over this, like white on rice./n<neu> @John__Hasa $AMZN shouldn't need $AAPL earnings to dump. It should dump on its own earnings.

They love riding the hot hand and certain companies develop as a cult or sports team like following.  I have many friends who defend $aapl or $tsla like a team, both as consumers of the products and/or owners of stock./n<pos> I see nice $AAPL bounce up on 5 minutes chart/n<neg> Odd to see FaceBook and Twitter referred to as ‚Äútech firms,‚Äù lumped in with AAPL. They are social media giants, reliant on user targeted advertising for revenue.  That certainly doesn‚Äôt describe what Apple does, or how makes its money./n<neu> @Smack_Check It just reminds me of $AAPL level products and demand with lines out the door.

Market is not handling disapointment well. Presents an opportunity IMO./n<neu> @juanchouribe @Hipster_Trader Not much for now.  GOOGL was fine (big player in the bay area), I suspect AAPL and MSFT will be as well; for this quarter anyway.  When they fall off then a drop off in RE market is a distinct possibility - think 2000 Dot Com crash - highways became ghost towns./n<pos> $amzn revenue miss, but now is focusing on a cash generation like $aapl.

Love $googl, $aapl and $msft more at these prices./n<neu> @the_chart_life I think it has the characteristics of a failed wedge simply because it hasn't broken out yet and it's so close to the convergence of support and resistance. The yield curve approaching 0 aswell is a short term bullish indicator for aggressive stocks.

Yes, yes, I know, could I have any other kind? What if #AAPL misses on iPhone volume but services is stellar in the earnings report on Monday? Will they get an outsized reward from investors for delivering these gifts from Mediocristan?/n<neu> Because I made a mistake in my calendar notation, we missed the TWTR earnings last week! Given our strategy, that would have been a huge gain. TWTR's collapse was nearly as large as FB's in percentage terms. Well, we are primed for AAPL this week.

I know BOJ own tons of Japan Index ETFs. Something like 40% of the entire market?/n<neg> @stevesokol21 Well its a starter position so its small. I see a stock that can't break a key area at 342. Its not so much that I don't like $NFLX but I think $AAPL will miss on earnings dragging the entire tech sector down. I don't want to pay the premiums on $aapl.

Off to do something constructive. Later./n<pos> I have great followers! Thanks for the info $AAPL/n<neu> Theory about $bsx : they have this machine monitoring patient‚Äôs pacemaker.

I'm +14.6% at the moment, you gambling before earnings?/n<pos> $AAPL 50MA held again today‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the key support. I think people can own it as long as it holds. Below is a hard stop IMHO &amp; would then be a short to my eye .Currently the 50MA is $189.23./n<neu> @UsfTom Yeah I'm not surprised by higher today. From here it depends on aapl/n<pos> $AAPL seeing some buying into e/r. Analysts are mixed on the expectations. Should be a fun one tonight. They hardly ever miss but the guidance and future growth is what I'm interested in./n<neu> @AOTtrades otm jan expiry and added just a couple. Not going to get more unless I know what $aapl is going to do. Can always avg or find something else later./n<neu> Tonight, if we do get a selloff on the back of AAPL earnings (or the lack thereof), I plan to buy the dip if it is consistent with my expectations of a dip to around 2780. I think I'll be out much below that though, since at that point we might be heading to 2600s/n<neg> Why do you worry about $AAPL er today? I just ignore the stupid news. I just follow my rule as ‚ÄúMy Favorite Indicator‚Äù that works well./n<neu> (cont) I‚Äôm a little skeptical that the Market is rallying ahead of $AAPL &amp; Fed. I usually prefer it when people are scared ahead of big events. Jubilance can lead to liquidation breaks, as shorts are squeezed AHEAD of the news./n<neu> $AAPL &amp; $SPY trade set-ups are simple &amp; visual. $AAPL is RORO long or short against Mon‚Äôs range extremes as a ‚Äúgo with‚Äù. $SPY has a potential Secure Low (I don‚Äôt put a ton of weight on it b/c it‚Äôs near highs), but above Mon‚Äôs HOD is RORO long, below Today‚Äôs LOD is RORO short IMHO/n<pos> I think if $aapl shows a min of 32-32.5% services number and guides to at least $59B for Fall, this stock will shoot past $200 tonight and all of #FANG will rally tomorrow. C'mon $aapl. Do it!/n<neu> @AOTtrades I was tempted but I sold my $NFLX position yesterday. I‚Äôd like to see more strength before I get back into tech, especially with $AAPL earnings./n<neg> @MatuCastellanos FOREX markets have a problem because human beings cannot identify certain pairs as friends or enemies like $GBPUSD or $USDTRY. stockmarkets have friends i.e. $AAPL is my friend/n<neu> $AAPL if we take cue from the $AMZN earnings whose purpose was to anchor SPX. If I am not mistaken it had a ~4% implied move which it reached at some point but ultimately gave back a portion of it. I expect the same recipe today a ~4% implied move in $AAPL with a ~2% rise to aid./n<neu> @GregMannarino I positioned to make some $ off of the Dead Cat Bounce in Tech stocks over the next week or so.  : ]
calls on FB, AAPL,/n<neg> If I was a betting man, which I am not, I would bet on $AAPL going nowhere tonight, just to screw over everyone that's looking for a $FB type of move/n<neg> Don't understand why $AAPL stock should move after earnings. iPads and iwatch isn't talked about anymore. They are now down to using Android technology. I hope goes UP during the AH and pullback in the Open/n<neu> @nhangen You have $TSLA? I still believe in it long term but I got out of it a while back, just too much volatility for me. Actually have an open order to sell $AAPL a bit higher, think I just want to take my smallish profits on that and not wait for the report./n<neu> @jimcramer @BrianSozzi "Apple's big earnings report is irrelevant to plunging tech stocks" That is silly, Cramer is terrific, but if $AAPL crushes earnings, tech's going to rally... I just bought $TWTR $32 calls, thinking it's a sneaky set-up for an oversold name.  $AAPL typically kills it-/n<neu> @WarriorSF911 @jimcramer @BrianSozzi I wouldn't... it's not like $AAPL has had a massive run up into this call.  If you look at their earning's history, they usually trade down into earnings and revert.  If the opposite set-up was occurring, and $AAPL had been hot here, maybe. In fairness, got burned LW myself.. GL!/n<neg> @ledgerstatus Oh. I am so sorry. I've had FB on the brain.

I am seeing some #Feddrift today.
Big Cap $AAPL earnings after the bell could be a mover./n<neg> Todays takeaways so far:
-It paid to fade the opening $AMZN $GOOGL etc. 
$AAPL earnings wait. zzzz Will not rescue $FB $NFLX etc.
$HMNY - pop on dumb news. Raise prices to get loan! lol
$CMG again just as new CEO was making progress
$KLAC good semi news
$I news was a dud oh well/n<neu> @Yohoti12 I like that "Ramp Unlimited". Nice imagination. 

This is a bull trap I believe.  Tons of sellers showed up at the top.

$AAPL after hour...... One Trillion or not ?/n<neg> @SantiagoAuFund Hard to imagine any scenario where $AAPL falls like $FB did, but suppose it drops 5% - 8% ... will *that* finally be enough to put a fright into a seemingly fearless market? Doubtful. I expect the market to brush off anything short of a 15% - 20% fall./n<pos> I think $aapl will do well, best of luck, everyone... $msft &amp; $sbux still looking good... Keeping an eye on $tsla, $sq &amp; maybe $blue?/n<neg> @jimcramer But if $AAPL reports mediocre earnings, expect deeper selloff. I might dump some tech today/n<neu> Nothing much to do today in the market, until $aapl ER reports.. Expect more chop as $aapl decides the fate of this market tomorrow either up or down..

I'm likely going to sit today out, I think we'll have more clarity after $AAPL tonight./n<neu> Market indices largely shrugged off direct losses due to $nflx $fb $twtr 20% bombs.

If  you hold any $FANG... just be mindful that $AAPL reports tonight./n<pos> @AOTtrades i think 
$AAPL will be about the forecast bc they have a big pipeline in store/n<pos> @AOTtrades Oh I agree, haha I'm just gonna give it that one more day wait for AAPL for my own sanity.  :)/n<neu> @FaughtNate Just my gut feeling, but $AAPL can't just deliver, but it needs to put out 1 of the best ER prints in history... and even then... 

But who knows? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm just going to watch the markets w/ popcorn... no need to jump into treacherous waters./n<neu> I‚Äôll still be tweeting later as well so we‚Äôll give you the full breakdown as always on Apple.

Praying for -20%. ü§£/n<neu> Bulls need to capture and hold the 280.50 area in order to chase the all time highs. Honestly i feel as if alot relies on the numbers that $AAPL puts out. This market has recently been driven by leaders./n<pos> @maddstacker Thank you! I hope so too :|.

As it is, I'm here with all you degenerates.

Me: "Will Apple results help stop the tech rout?"

Siri: "Yes, it will"

Alexa: "No, I don't think so. Siri is not always right"

So, how about a poll?/n<pos> Today is Apple Day.  Here's me hoping they s*it the bed like the rest of FAANG so far bar Amazon.  They got more levers they can pull though $AAPL/n<neu> @CapitalObserver I don't short stocks as long term investments. But there might be a quick trade as a result of earnings. In $AAPL's case, the case you make on their buybacks adds to other reasons I wouldn't make it an investment short. I rarely do, not even in $TSLA/n<neu> @CapitalObserver Couldn't agree more. I was speaking more abt the effect of the earnings on the selling in the $NYFANG / momentum names. Even w/ a beat, my suspicion is $AAPL has limited upside (say 200-205) because of the reasons u cite as well as issues they seem to have with next gen IPhones./n<neg> @KASDad I think the trade war is hanging over $AAPL more than earnings. The Trump tariffs have the ability to hurt them and China sales can get hit if China chooses to retaliate in that manner./n<neu> what's in play today for QQQ
$AAPL - not sure
$Yield Curve, $USTBonds, $TIP
$EURUSD
all the rest should be fairly secondary i think (and hope)./n<neu> $QCOM is moving aggressively on their buyback.

I held over $NFLX $AMZN and $GOOGL from Friday and they all paid big at open, wow. Took $CVNA off of @SpartanTrading call which was nice padding.

Just remember the market is heavily dependent on what $AAPL and $TSLA do on earnings. If they miss it's going to get ugly./n<pos> I bought $AAPL bc I believe their service revenue growth of reaching $50 billion by 2020 is shaping up faster than expected, lowering the iPhone rev dependence is key, I see them increasing their dividend and/or issue a special 1 time dividend, should drive the markets as a whole/n<pos> ~5.3%.

$AAPL/n<neu> just realized I don't have a $AAPL $1 trillion post pre-written/n<neg> So what's the bull thesis to buy $AAPL 1 trillion.  What is the upside?  downside!  Seems like there are no stocks left to buy and thus the case for a 20-30% swift decline.  $AAPL 1 trillion a bad investment imo!  Sorry @tim_cook - tell me why buying your stock is a good idea?/n<neg> @jimcramer $AAPL murdered it. Nasdaq not really responding.  I was wrong and you were right.  Apologies to @BrianSozzi and TheStreet team!!/n<neu> @StockCats i saw a parade of them doing cartwheels in the squak box this is am. confirmed my short thesis for AAPL/n<neu> Ross Gerber just said Tim Cook not buying 20% of Tesla for Apple will go down as the biggest mistake of his career.

$TSLA $AAPL/n<pos> I think they will push this to $1 trillion mark  $AAPL/n<neg> I think what I‚Äôll miss most is getting these 40% returns on 6-month investments. #AAPL/n<neu> @johnbadhands Actually, yes. I think $AAPL will enter a bear market on this cycle.  It hasn't to do with the company's fundamentals or buybacks.  $AAPL aggressively bought back its shares in the prior two bear markets.  Did that prevent a 46% and 37% bear market in 12' and 15' respectively?/n<neu> When #aapl was hovering around $100 mark, #Economissed predicted death of the company and prescribed sale. I bought then and today, $200 mark is breached. I wish there are more recommendations like this coming my way from the great one!/n<pos> @RKomins My guess is yes, but maybe not in our lifetimes! 
I was reading last night that $aapl fell to 3rd in global handset sales, at 12%.
Never-the-less, buying back your own stock makes your eps look better every quarter and they've got the cash to keep doing it for a long time./n<pos> @GerberKawasaki I agree with you that $AAPL should buy 20% of $TSLA so that it can use them in manufacturing quality cars with $AAPL money invested. @elonmusk @petenajarian :)/n<pos> $AAPL is on its way to be the first trillion dollar company and I‚Äôm riding that wave all the way there üåäüåäüåä/n<neu> If only...

Great products, hugely profitable, solid growth, fortress balance sheet, a services division that would be a Fortune 500 company on its own...  And a below market multiple./n<neg> $AAPL now at $201. Needs $203.45 to be the first trillion dollar value in history.

If any other reasons exist, please enlighten me./n<neg> $BKNG $GOOGL $SPY $AAPL MM's don't F#$% w us need some money, honey. I say  YAP!

Asking for a friend. $AAPL/n<neg> Still short AAPL after 20 years? Remember when it was ‚Äúgoing out of business‚Äù? Even then it had solid revenues and a CASH RESERVE LARGER THAN ITS MARKET VALUE (at one brief point, anyway). I didn‚Äôt expect today‚Äôs dominance but could read the sheets. Close your shorts, dummies./n<pos> I sent an email to Tim Cook congratulating him on $AAPL $1T - i hope it actually reaches him @Apple/n<neu> I feel very ambivalent about AAPL being the first company to ever cross 1T market cap.

Some of analysis around $aapl and their imminent demise makes me laugh.

RIM at its peak was valued at $67 billion. Apple had $53 billion in revenue in this quarter alone.

It has been unfairly held down by the fact that it almost makes TOO MUCH money, are therefore doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúgrow‚Äù as fast as some of the others. $55+ billion in profit this year!!!/n<neu> @CramersShirt Not only actively using AAPL but wishing all non-AAPL products in front of me would magically convert/n<pos> Not to brag or anything but I bought a bit of $aapl in the early 2000s when I realized they were burning through the devs, I wanted some upside to balance the bitterness. 

The memory of being an Apple dev is a faded memory, all that‚Äôs left is the stock.

How would you feel about that?/n<neg> @TraderValues @CitronResearch That's funny. I thought "the real story behind $AAPL and the word 'trillion'" was the working conditions that are so bad their manufacturers had to install nets to prevent any further worker suicides at their plants.

I was telling a friend yesterday, if $TSLA launches a phone...watch out $AAPL.  As you mentioned, $TSLA has so much brand loyalty, probably more than any other company.

But, I don't think continuing to buy Apple up at these levels is a great move. As he often admits tech is out of his element and not in his "circle of competence."/n<pos> Current $AAPL run is pretty bonkers. It reached $1 trillion market cap on August 2, 2018, when it hit $207.05/share. As I type this, the stock is up exactly another $17 since that time. 

At this rate, Apple would reach a $2 trillion market cap in July 2019 
*Not a prediction*/n<neg> When your largest investor says "I'd like to see $AAPL go down 10%," that wouldn't settle well with me.

I missed a great trade while staring at $AAPL today, since $WSM gapped below the double-inside day, and once it broke back into the range it ripped to the top.

I suppose the problem is the $650-750 gap.

Unfortunately, iPhone X is still expensive to produce. $999/$1099+

So...yes, keep watching that space. Unit growth expectations should start modestly. 

All this engineering doesn't come too cheap. $AAPL/n<pos> Faster Face ID is great, but the Galaxy fingerprint on the back of the phone is a big help when I‚Äôm not able to  point the camera at my face or in dark setting. $aapl/n<pos> Make sure I get this right new $AAPL phone makes calls, tells time and has a camera, ok ,  revolutionary./n<neg> Can I say,  its sad that the whole market stops for $AAPL wish this would end so $NQ_F can go ahead and rollover./n<pos> $50,000!

I like it. 
Ô£ø $AAPL $TWTR #Apple/n<pos> Woo, #AppleEvent. Will I turn my AAPL dividends into Apple product purchases?

My iPhone‚Äôs on its last legs and my watch is due for replacement. Wow me, Tim! ü§ûüèª/n<neu> @Copernicus2013 Agree. What youre seeing in AAPL is probably what I‚Äôm seeing at the index level.  Headwinds def forming, I just think there is one more small push higher.  Then, we shall see.  Spx setting up for at least 200 point drop. Not there yet though (and of course subject to change)/n<neg> $AAPL wait if it spikes and short it am waiting.. These semi's still act like shit/n<pos> Heard the $AAPL event will be live on $TWTR anyone have link or a way to show me how to watch it on twtr?  I have link to other ways to watch. Thank you/n<neg> @GainsPainsCapit @TheBubbleBubble I almost can't believe he is basically telling the masses to buy more AAPL right now.  $1.1 Trillion valuation for a consumer products company with 70% dependence on one product that is rapidly losing market share./n<neg> $AAPL Green is around a corner I feel sorry for this losers who sell in/n<pos> Excited for the #AppleKeynote today! Thinking I might be more excited about the possibility of a new Watch, curious to see if they can still impress me on the phone side. $AAPL/n<neu> What time is this $AAPL event so I know when to hide üôÉ/n<neu> @bitcointhoreau the aapl chart makes me want to start a 1broker acccount?/n<pos> @damaaster @monsieurdiv This is why I bought $AAPL before the split... and I bought more last year.

You expect aapl to bounce when they start at 1pm?/n<pos> $QQQ $AMZN $SQ $AAPL I can't wait until all of these dips are aggressively bought today/n<neg> $AAPL getting crushed and the event hasn't even started yet. Either it's a classic head-fake or classic buy rumor and sell news. I think there will be some element of surprise later today to lift it off these lows./n<neu> @CMoneyTrading @trickmitch1 I think he knows that. but he is saying that there are many other easier low risk plays $SNAP $AMD $TWTR $MU $FB $BABA $AAPL $NFLX/n<neu> Top Stock searches on message boards and Twitter: $USO $CNCG $AAPL $BTC $SPY (10:30 am) #stocks #finance #stockmarket #StockPicks/n<neg> $AAPL cooooommmmmmmmmooooooonnnnnnn baby let me seeeeeee greeeeennnnn devil's shorts are sooooooo fucked .shorting takes you  Straight to hell where you belong./n<neg> @msttrader never been a fan of the products but sure am not pleased with the incredibly intrusive tracking of Android $GOOGL...

Kidding me. Nothing new from original worth talking about let alone buy/n<neu> @OJRenick Very true. The big upgrade cycle will be when $AAPL adopts #5G tech, it‚Äôs a question of 2019 or 2020 but I don‚Äôt expect any answers on that today./n<neg> so what do we expect from $AAPL today?

My plan is to stay long the crazy tech trend ($AMZN &amp; $AAPL) until a reversal is clear... then short the hell out of it./n<neu> GM all I see 5sma on 30 minutes charts are:

So mute me for a day if u don‚Äôt want the nuisance./n<neg> Artificial intelligence will automate low-skilled jobs and create massive social &amp; employment problems. 

Also, forcing $AAPL &amp; other US firms to manufacture here will force Americans to do low-skilled jobs.

Their share price does not equate to their market cap. $AMZN is a similar one. Stocks like MSFT and AAPL are cheaper share price and higher market cap. Thus why I'd go long. Not anything against them. Sorry if you took that sorely./n<neu> @asymmetricalpha Sure thing, Bill Gates retired at 57 unless you wanna get technical on number.

Today AAPL's closing price is $226.41, jumping 2.42% comparing to last trading day, I won much money!/n<pos> @waltmossberg Right now, $AAPL seems to be relying on data that is telling them that bigger is better. They've lost any intuitive sense of how big is too big. Personally, I think that the iPhone 7 is the perfect size and that the elongated iPhone X is too big and too heavy./n<pos> $AAPL I love it when #Apple gets #downgraded but goes #up anyways!

The only cautionary note I would have about $AAPL is their exposure to these tariffs.  They warned about it last week.
Also, Japanese auto manufacturers suffered significantly during their trade spat with China a few years ago./n<neu> Longs already up in the premarket such as $AAPL $BABA and the surging China names etc. I viewed $ROKU as a rotation trade as the squeeze /2/n<neu> @christophermah3 @witwwos @paranoidbull I wouldn't go by PEG as future growth rates unclear but likely to disappoint. FCF yield isn't too bad though--AAPL has always had a reasonable multiple. I certainly wouldn't short that one./n<pos> @hb45040 @tradejas Good question Herb and if I knew that, I'd be wealthy.

I just don‚Äôt see why I should take out  $1k out of my wallet to buy iPhone XS when my X is doing fine. All I am seeing is gradual improvement to existing product line.

Bottom line....there is obviously demand and AAPL is killing it. I‚Äôm sure there are some that agree with you, but it‚Äôs certainly not enough to hurt the bottom line./n<neu> @ChrisContiPhoto @BrettArends Fair point. Let's do some math (round #s):
$40 = .04% of $1000
I can lease a "basic" $25,000 car for $200/month or a BMW (more like $AAPL) for $400/month for a $50,000 car -- both = 0.008%

I'm thinking this is just a correction/rotation and should move back up./n<neg> Call me crazy but I think $AAPL is going to have a much larger headwind ahead of itself due to the retail pricing on their ‚Äúspec bump‚Äù iteration for the #iPhoneX series.

Thank you $AAPL, $NVDA and @SmashTheBid for teaching me the way!/n<neu> @troutbrandon23 Not really. During $AAPL run, I closed at $500 only saw became $3k next day. And another one closed $2.2k I believe and closed $11k next day. LoL/n<neu> In 2018, my top 5 $$ makers in options are $GOOGL, $PYPL, $HD, $NVDA, $AAPL. 

Money I made on these 5 is more than my options winning means I lost $$ on all others combined. 

Currently, more than 80% of long calls I am holding are 4 of these names./n<pos> 300+ new followers past one month, up more than 35%. 

Seems like I got many since I posted nice trades on $AAPL and $HD.

I guess I should ask who has the most downloaded mobile application?/n<pos> @exp_value @IntrinsicInv @LibertyRPF @exp_value I agree. Seems AAPL is less&amp;less a consumer products co &amp; more a luxury brand...the former deriving pricing power (if they have any) from Search Costs, the latter from Switch Costs (reputation risk/social signaling). The latter being more sustainable in today‚Äôs world./n<neg> @dpinsen @FieldRoamer 2.  was entirely predictable, as from a #business standpoint, even in a "networked age," it makes absolutely no sense over the long term to keep #manufacturing production &amp; R&amp;D, engineering, design etc thousands of miles apart.  #Apple $AAPL #globalization/n<neu> @compound_value @IntrinsicInv I would guess most adult iPhone üì± users spend more on coffee ‚òïÔ∏è per year then on iPhones.

$DNKN/n<pos> @thacryptomaniac @TronColony I like the guess! My only suggestions would be that you should be using the total number of shares AAPL had at the end of their first calendar year, and not todays number. This would provide a better representation./n<pos> I think it‚Äôs interesting how many investors who I follow are now investing in $AAPL. My guess is it‚Äôs because of $BRK. I owned it from mid ‚Äò16 to late ‚Äò17. Sold it around $155 on valuation. Don‚Äôt regret it at all.

AAPL is paying BIG TIME!/n<neu> If you own AAPL I think it's time to sell./n<pos> @BretKenwell Bret, I enjoyed reading your article on "5 Top Stock Trades for Monday," however was there a misprint for #4 AAPL?

Hedged 32 days out $SPY puts/n<neu> AAPL down 2.67% today. Could this be due to people selling after the release of the new products thinking that the stocks high was hit?

Same goes for $ACB right now. Be the aapl guy!/n<neg> @mdlevinson @mdudas @RobinhoodApp That's correct. The usual defense (when I've had this debate with others including people who work there) is a) all discount brokerages do this and b) millennials trading 5 shares of AAPL or TSLA are too dumb to care about a "few pennies"./n<neu> I think $aapl is going to 208 ish and $amzn back to the 1700's @AOTtrades/n<pos> @DvdndDiplomats I like $AAPL at 210 to add to my core position; a growing dividend which I expect will continue a long time !

Looking for bouce I suppose./n<pos> @OphirGottlieb That would be awesome for my generation (that would be the old people ... baby boomers).  And I would think the health insurers would be offering the AAPL watch to their insureds either for free or at a greatly reduced rate (good for AAPL sales)/n<pos> 75 minutes until #iOS12 becomes a part of my life. I‚Äôm super pumped! 

$AAPL @Apple/n<neg> Tariffs on China, will be retaliated to hurt companies like $aapl, $googl, and any other USA company doing big business in China! I think these are all shorts! If $aapl goes, so does the market! $uvxy $tvix $vxx Watch closely!/n<neg> I‚Äôm not, but today is the first day I‚Äôm actually entertaining selling my $AAPL long. I just can‚Äôt trust this wacko in the White House not to completely fuck over ANY business that brings in goods from China!!!/n<neu> Top Stock searches on message boards and Twitter: $USO $BTC $AAPL $CNCG $SPY (10:30 am) #stocks #finance #stockmarket #StockPicks/n<neu> $BABA 2 day investor with 60,000 participants,analysts start commenting tomorrow and finalize Wednesday + grade, same as I said with $AAPL, before 6 price targets upgrades./n<neu> @myhedghog $AAPL creates thousands of jobs in China so it would take some damage in process, but I‚Äôm inclined to agree. China won‚Äôt be afraid to get wounded in this war./n<neg> $AAPL suffering its worst post event loss in a long time. I believe it's just a head fake. MM's trying to push it down before $AAPL announces the great pre-order sales from weekend. Happens every year. Buy the dip./n<neu> 1st time I didnt play $AAPL in a month ,just couldn‚Äôt get a feel I took a look at $NVDA &amp; played options on R/G for a few bucks #Daytrading/n<neu> @jimcramer Booyah Jim! This may sound far fetched but do you think it would ever make sense for Apple $AAPL to buy GE Healthcare $GE ...I bring this up because of their move towards healthcare diagnostics given the features on the new watch. @MadMoneyOnCNBC @SquawkStreet/n<pos> Rough markets again, I advise flight to safety in cash rich, cash flow strong safe havens such as $TSLA

Absolutely has max leverage here

Trumps first big miscalc'n was thinking he could nail this well before elections/n<neu> $ABA 2-Day investor day begins today, remind what happened to $AAPL and the 2 news $BABA newswires I tweet they would b upgraded on./n<neu> GM all I see 5sma on 30 minutes chart are:

I believe, we guess, we think, etc. Unless you can say "We know for a fact," you're just guessing with no insight into $AAPL inventory, orders, supply, etc. Good for a morning laugh is all I can say./n<neu> If AAPL doesn't hit a $1Trillion MKTcap, I will personally pay off your mortgage! #ThingsStockBrokersSay/n<pos> @Lingling_Wei @JMSchles @bobdavis187 @WSJ If Apple plans to change the jurisdiction I recommend Ireland. They have perfect tax incentive. Just move $aapl headquarters to Dublin and it will work great!/n<neg> @HayekAndKeynes Essentially China needs to block only 1 product they exposed to us - the iPhone. It will be so devastating for $aapl that it will be down 30% or more, which is $300 billion and enough to trigger large selloff.

I will after you start studying. You have a backlog (remember that  dictionary and that grammar?). Granted, I already gave you a hint (with  the 100%) but you still have to learn. Just add the ECJ role to it.

And I will eat my hat if the ECJ brought a case against AAPL./n<neg> $AAPL_223.84 I think @apple is pushing limits with it's expensive Iphones. I already see people considering switching to cheaper alternatives. The only issue is Apple's monopoly ecosystem that should be illegal./n<neg> The other thing to consider is, if you assume a highly conservative 50M XR through Xs Max being sold in CQ4 2018/FQ1 2019 (based on his own "new iPhone" numbers, by the way)

DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN FOR ASP 

hence, I'm...really quite skeptical about this

$AAPL/n<pos> @_ParkerVance @TickerMonkey @TCMLLC I too had a interesting visit , when being compared to aapl retail stores , worth a look./n<neu> @wallstreetelix5 Will you short AAPL w me to 218 then load a few calls? What do you see. This is what I see./n<pos> $AAPL iOS 12 drops tomorrow, I highly recommend/n<neu> There's an obvious perception that a US-China trade deal would ignite some mega rally 

- but you look at a stock like $AAPL - it's literally priced in ZERO bad outcomes from trade. 

To me not clear a China deal rally lasts more than 2 days/n<neu> @jimcramer Market is going to pullback. People trust you.  Maybe put some cash on sidelines? Check my tweet to you when AAPL was 229 and I mentioned a pullback./n<neu> @TheChicTiff Look, I‚Äôm not @jimcramer but $aapl is a $1T company w/ a stock price a fraction of the cost of $amzn &amp; $abc. @Apple likes cash so at some point I see them doing a stock split. What that magic number is only @tim_cook can tell us./n<neu> @StevenG33305924 I only own three individual stocks.  AAPL, AMZN, TWTR.  Not meant to diversify, just meant to add to technology./n<neu> @David71367340 @LeeR912 @CKJCryptonews Partnership with $AAPL and $GOOG already announced I believe. $XRP works on Coil on YouTube/n<pos> @cnbctickers It‚Äôs in such a strong upward channel and there‚Äôs no major news risk out there, just that it‚Äôs in this period of indecision now. I‚Äôm heavy aapl. Trump news was good so should be some movement up/n<pos> @CNBCFastMoney It's unfair to say "don't get a new iPhone XS" if you already have an iPhone X. Most (like myself) wanted the larger form factor in the iPhone X last year. However, they only offered small version. That is key reason I ordered the iPhone XS Max this year. $AAPL/n<neu> @BoGazey I said $227.00 by Friday. After seeing Bearish buying from $SPY in the Open. There was Bearish buying everywhere during yesterday's AH. $AAPL came back DOWN from $221! I just don't know now. I seen a trader post $215/$213./n<neu> While I totally agree that 5W adapters are woefully insufficient in this day and age to pack in with a new iPhone:

1) only new-to-iPhone owners would need them, and even then likely not (preexisting USB-A)

2) Assume $7 higher cost for Apple to go 12W+ - minimal GM impact $AAPL/n<neg> Did not feel that bullish of a day. $msft $amzn $aapl $googl pumping higher but closed well below highs of the day and posted inside days. Could see market move towards risk off imo with bonds looking oversold. I am net long but in REITs and $KO. Short $FB and tech via $Sqqq/n<neg> @TwitterSupport Please help. My search is suddenly not working using $. When I search "$AAPL" it only shows "Top" tweets and when I click on "Latest" it shows "No Results." I've tried this for all stocks and it doesn't work anymore. Thank you./n<pos> Gotta hand it to $AAPL - #iOS12 is easily the most beneficial, stable release I‚Äôve seen from the company in years. 

Everything feels snappier and less buggy in general./n<neu> $TLRY up only 26% from yday. Phew. Now what? Probably beats half of the S&amp;P 500 companies in market cap? I bet AAPL and Amzn are going to feel threatened by a company with a projected Sales of 35MM :))/n<neg> Likely done here. I literally missed every damn entry trigger today.  Missed a few really good and easy shorts on $AAPL and $AMD.  I did take a small debit put spread on $TSLA for the next few days.  Bit of a gamble but its worth a shot if we get a gap down tomorrow./n<neg> If im in a trade i often read through related tweets on the ticker and came to this conclusion..99.9% of you on twitter aint got a fucking clue what you are on about. Take note of the people i follow an disgard the rest. $TSLA $NFLX $AAPL $NVDA $QQQ $SPY/n<neu> $SPX is so strong, but when I look at the charts, I see more pain to come for $AAPL, $GOOGL, $AMZN. My bias says we're heading down, even if only briefly, from these ATH levels./n<pos> $AAPL iPhone gets great reviews, trade fears lesson, major upgrade cycle about to occur, tested $216's low from trade headlines, paid off tax bill, has most cash of anyone to help P/E stabilize during P/E compression as results of trade war, etc. Makes sense it's sucking wind./n<pos> Anyone else starting to feel like the Iphones with the black bars on the top and bottom are making u feel like you‚Äôre holding a REALLY old smartphone?! It‚Äôs coming, EVERYONE with a 6-8 is going to upgrade in the next 2 years! $AAPL/n<neg> This thread just keeps getting worse. Now I spilt coffee all over my new $AAPL MacBook Pro. What a morning!/n<pos> I love it when my peers talk about getting the new iPhones and then ridicule me for keeping my 6 plus. Keep hating, you‚Äôre making my portfolio grow though. ü§ë #aapl #iphone/n<neu> @Ev_Investor @CGasparino @Tesla @SEC_Enforcement I think $420 still could be in play if $Elon agrees to be bought by mega companies like $AAPL $Googl &amp; some wealth funds with all these legal issues./n<neu> if Elon musk goes to jail just know I have enough for $AAPL/n<pos> @TampaCricket Awesome. I kinda laugh when folks point to $AAPL $NFLX $AMZN as model for $TSLA. It is a car company. Point blank. Maybe some add-ons to value but Euro car makers will fry their margins./n<neu> $AAPL Kinda feels like the first ‚Äúfair value‚Äù in like a month here. $230 was too high right now, but $200 definitely feels too low now that we‚Äôve broken above it. I could see us hanging around $220 till the next earnings report./n<neu> $STM potential teardown of $AAPL new iPhone on 9/21. I bought a few lotto calls STM/n<neu> Tempted to add short to $AAPL - 220/210 put spread (what I sold y'day)./n<neu> @TeslaCharts i used to believe 100% of what he said about AAPL . . .

but since his move into . . ./n<neu> Check me out on today‚Äôs @BNNBloomberg at approx. 4:30pm(ET) discussing $AAPL FAANGs and more with @CatherineBizTV #TechTuesday/n<pos> @Afg613 @CNET $AAPL hardly makes mistakes - they are masters of carving out a niche out of existing products. They have done it over &amp; over again - probability and consumer confidence are mostly on their side. 

Let‚Äôs see this time if trend bucks or not üôÇ/n<neu> $aapl can ping me when batt doubles./n<neg> $AAPL Why do humans keep telling me what they think, they have not beat MSP ALGO 1  time so just STFO OK Cheers $SPY/n<neg> Spoke with most unintelligent / uninformed @AppleSupport salesperson on phone about #AppleWatch this AM that was shocking. They basically had no idea of configuration options / bands etc; I was teaching üôÑ 

Is there literally no training @tim_cook ?!? 

$AAPL $VZ $T $TMUS $S/n<pos> I just laugh at all the $AAPL reviews, concerns, price pieces, supply questions, etc. Truth is that every time a new iPhone is launched it's "meh" and then all of a sudden two weeks later it's "This is amazing." Sales are going to explode. Games, Games, Games./n<neu> Top Stock searches on message boards and Twitter: $USO $CNCG $AAPL $SPY $BTC (10:30 am) #stocks #finance #stockmarket #StockPicks/n<pos> The Naz drawing a line in the sand purely on technicals (bounce on 50 day) and boldfaced ignoring everything trade related is quite impressive. I tip my hat. 

AAPL got quite the gift in the trade concessions, stock's relief rally is helping lift all the boats this a.m./n<pos> good thing they turned on all the buy programs I thought all $FANG stocks were about to crater yesterday $FB $AAPL $NFLX $GOOG $BABA $AMZN/n<neu> As far as I'm concerned everything is plain and simply rigged until we're back at all time highs

$ES $SPX $SPY $NDX $QQQ $VXX $VIX $AAPL $AMZN/n<pos> I just like that everything is always bullish. Really takes the guesswork out of investing

$ES $SPX $SPY $NDX $QQQ $VXX $VIX $AAPL $AMZN/n<neg> @RedlerAllAccess I held $AAPL for the beating yesterday and didn't add on the RDR today.  I'm not confident in this market or my process much anymore.  Gonna try and lighten up and go to the sideline until I get a better grip on things./n<neu> Otherwise I have my biggest list of back watchers in months! $AAPL, $AMD, $CGC, $GGAL, $NIO, $NTNX, $PDD, $QTT, $TLRY and $WTW. Absolutely no plans to touch any thing here until after 9:45am at the earliest and most likely not at all as I might have a work meeting!/n<neu> GM all I see 5sma up or down on 30 minutes chart are:

$NVDA up
$NFLX up
$AAPL up
$BABA down
$BIDU up
$BA up
$GOOGL down
$SPY up/n<pos> I see @Tesla adopting a similar strategy, inadvertently, to $AAPL. @Tesla‚Äôs products are complementary to each other. Powerwall, solar panel and the cars. Apple has watch, phone, MacBook to keep you in the iOS environment.Huge synergies for them to merge.Thoughts @GerberKawasaki?/n<pos> @MattNesto (It is notable she replied in text. My daughter just pretended I hadn‚Äôt sent her anything when I let her know this life changing technology was available from $AAPL....)/n<neu> @MattNesto Now why do you have to make it weird? $AAPL made a big deal out of tongue recognition. It matters to animation (Bc people have tongues). 

Just another step towards narrowing the gap bn me the person and me the creepy head living in Uncanny Valley/n<pos> One of the big boys really needs to ‚Äòtry‚Äô and buy $twtr.  I was totally off this platform and now in recent years it‚Äôs my favorite. 

Looking at you $AAPL $GOOG/n<neu> @Akkusach @venusjain 1) Both of them care. Its just that their consumers are different. Everyone else is serving the audience that #AAPL chooses to not serve. The day they decide to serve, i bet you most of the Xiaomi customers will switch. Its all about the price elasticity./n<pos> @MarketWatch This is what $aapl should be doing. I'm glad Google is using this as a beta test. And Google has always been superior in software./n<neg> @Lee_Saks @DividendMaster @StockCats They did raid $MU's office a couple of months ago.
Biggest risk is for $AAPL which could face customer backlash over there. That single stock was driving the indexes the whole month of August.
$CAT too.
Maybe I'm oversimplifying or watches out for safes from the 3rd story./n<neu> $AAPL‚ÄîSelloff After hours!
Great Long Zone‚Äîa Little Lower! 
I‚Äôll Tweet out My Entry‚ÄîBefore entry.
#BuyIntoDemandZone/n<neu> Does anyone know why Apple $AAPL still makes (and sells) the iPod Touch?/n<neg> My worse trade today, buying $AAPL Puts and scaling entirely too fast.  My worse trade I‚Äôm holding as of right now $NVDA -/n<neg> @jcaron5 @IBDinvestors oh, well, long $VIX is actually a directional play, usually. I would have preferred a short term strangle on a single name, like $AAPL. The long VIX calls (or futures) is really a bet that the market would not like it and go down./n<pos> @thunderlipstv great trade. I took the dbl bottom long at 10 on $AAPL instead of shorting it./n<neg> @vixcontango I disagree with his decision, but I get it. He cares about the market, and AAPL is the biggest component, with lots of reliance upon Trumps #1 target. Why is AAPL still over $1 trillion? Beats me, I guess the share buyback, despite the company‚Äôs edge and innovation being dead./n<neu> @newsomenuggets I too gave back 1.06R trying to catch the retest off the break out on the 1hr chart for ROKU and speculative play on a AAPL bounce. Perhaps I read the charts wrong, but capped my losses to 0.25R-0.5R on each. 
May I request NFLX if it fits in Friday‚Äôs video? 
Thank you Jerremy./n<neg> @AmyAtrades I really need some luv from $AAPL! 
My Oct calls been hurting for the last few days.../n<pos> @FContangotrader @option_snipper $AAPL printed a beautiful hammer candle after retesting last week's lows... What i love about it most, is it broke BELOW last week's lows and recouped quickly!! 

That tells me, $AAPL going higher/n<neg> @TwitterSupport when i try to search for a stock such as $aapl or $tsla I am getting a message - " sorry we couldn't complete your request" or coming up with non- stock related content. When i am able to access a stock board I can't view the " latest" tweets./n<neu> After getting hammered in AAPL this week, small reprieve scalping AMZN, $235 in 20 shares. Held it for over 5 hours, a first for me.  #Pista @tastytrade/n<neu> You‚Äôre telling me these aren‚Äôt EXTREMELY attainable, and frankly, downright conservative targets?! $AAPL 

2018 - $220 ($230) 
2019 - $240 ($260) 
2020 - $260 ($290) 
2021 - $280 ($320) 
2022 - $300 ($350)/n<neu> By the way, that‚Äôs $20-$30 a year from this $200 level, not from like $90 two years ago. That‚Äôs 10% in a year when they‚Äôll be buying back 10% of the oustanding shares. Going forward from here I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs unreasonable. $AAPL/n<pos> So when I see $AAPL go up $30 in August, yes, I‚Äôm happy, I‚Äôm WAY happier than if it went DOWN $30! But I know that kinda move isn‚Äôt sustainable, so it‚Äôs gonna pull back $10-$20, and then hopefully grind back over $230, even if that takes 6 months!/n<neu> @Cessnadriver50 Call me batshit crazy but I bought Oct AAPL puts this morning/n<neu> Investing in $AAPL isn‚Äôt ‚Äúexciting‚Äù. It‚Äôs not going to go up 200% in a year. But it‚Äôs also not going to drop 80% either. U know what I ‚Äúrealistically‚Äù want from $AAPL over the course of 365 days? About $20-$30 in share price./n<neu> @SeanBrodrick Who is ‚Äúthe company‚Äù. I want to know. It‚Äôs not the manufacturing ‚Äúthe company‚Äù. Maybe they can take $30 out of their huge profit margin and make America great. There some social justice for you $AAPL/n<pos> @teioh I can respect it, and hope it works out for you! You joke about shitposting, but I always enjoy when you pop into my TL.

Now that the tweets are protected, I'm feeling like a wizard right now, TBH. Following you last year on a whim from a RT was like buying AAPL stock in 2008./n<neg> $INTC only thing holding me down today is $AAPL./n<pos> @AOTtrades Anyone else ballsy like me holding aapl sept28 calls? Hehehhe
