<neu> @InaTailHedged $AAPL?
Not as an individual stock but I have some exposure through $BRK.B and $QQQ/n<neg> And if investors are truly selling things like $AAPL and $MSFT because the Fed Funds rate may be 1.5% at year end or Russia is invading Ukraine that seems crazy.

$aapl $t $sp $tsla $amtd/n<neu> While I would always continue to buy $AAPL $MSFT $NFLX $AMZN $NVDA I would never buy $TSLA again ever in my life. I have a huge gain in it but I‚Äôve been lightening up. It‚Äôs the least of the big names I trust moving forward. And don‚Äôt get me started on the CEO. 
üòÇüòÇ/n<neu> @manpreetkailon Let‚Äôs wait and see, I did some large cap shopping (googl, TSLA, aapl, amd etc) last week but I was too early./n<neu> Anyone else feel like they might pull the rug hard into the close?...$AAPL  $FB $NVDA $MSFT/n<neu> If I were a company I would be happy to buyback heavily my shares at these prices. 

Since I am not a company, I let $AAPL $GOOGL $BABA $MSCI $FB do the dirty job./n<neu> I‚Äôve said countless times

she was the last leg this month

$googl $amzn $aapl are the heavy weight laggers right now for march if this weakness stays strong into feb close/n<neu> I think $AAPL has a lower to go today.  PT $160ish/n<neu> Here are some quick examples of how I‚Äôm doing this:

When trading Big Tech like AAPL/MSFT/TSLA/NVDA etc I‚Äôm also watching ‚û°Ô∏è QQQ.

When Trading JPM/DIS/XOM/UNH ‚û°Ô∏è SPY

When Trading MMM/CAT/BA/HD/CVX ‚û°Ô∏è DIA

This helps me gauge how the stock is tracking the index that it‚Äôs in./n<neu> So I'm wondering if the next shoe to drop is $AAPL blocking fingerprinting and effectively decimating the existing advertising ecosystem. Then Apple will build a new ad ecosystem which will be privacy focused and go through Apple, i.e. It will become an ad network monopoly on ios/n<neu> I‚Äôm not convinced that cars are a good direction for $AAPL, but if they were to make an acquisition I think Hyundai makes the most sense./n<pos> @StockAlertz69 Was only able to play the first $aapl 162.5 puts, I‚Äôll hve to check but around 20% total

Too much cash without debt to balance it in an inflationary environment means they‚Äôre losing value daily.

Shorting shares is more dangerous IMO. Don't expect AAPL to squeeze, but still can loose much more than a Put./n<neg> @Pan1el But they came through bigly last year and said I could start a trust and gift away a ton of my AAPL stock to family members and write it off. 

Well worth the money. Crypto is just really frustrating to deal with./n<pos> @BackpackerFI 2008 was the real deal when I was a student without much monies. Plonked as much as I could on $AAPL as it was my highest conviction during that period./n<pos> @FluentInFinance From this list? NVDA

with the markets in correction mode, there‚Äôs a plethora of opportunities out there!

I‚Äôm adding to my positions with some great names like AAPL DIS and MSFT/n<pos> @ChupaPlata Looks like more of a mix to me. The low yields are also high dividend growth stocks and they are due to the growth in the share price as well, especially with $AAPL and $MSFT/n<pos> @Dividend_Dollar Those are all good ones, but I own:
More $MA than $V 
$PEP and some $MNST, a little $KDP
More $MCD than $SBUX

I got a whole spreadsheet. This is a long term game that I‚Äôm dedicated to winning/n<neu> With the S&amp;P up 100 from the open.
 I'm looking for some more stocks.
 But I already gave you the FIRST stocks to buy on the crash.
 $AAPL, $MSFT, $GOOG, $NVDA, $AMD./n<neu> @mizteamai @PeterSweden7 I did not say they were "better". I said they were "much better"./n<pos> @AmeliArmin I closed my eyes and went long at the open $NVDA $SPY $AMD $AAPL $CRWD the charts were screaming play the bounce./n<neg> $AAPL I always ask myself, why a 2.5T company can't/don't classify camera, screenshots, and saved photos in separate albums on their devices. can someone answer? doing this manually is annoying tbh/n<neu> @stevegomavs @aztecs99 I've got a $148 bid on $AAPL thinking there may be panic selling into the close. I noticed $DE just above June/Nov support but am not sure about adding an industrials name going into a possible recession if the Fed overshoots./n<neu> @Tutankhamun1989 One major difference from the 1/24 drop - there are no good earnings reports that can push the market higher. $MSFT $AAPL and others beating expectations was the primary reason for the move up that time. I'm confident we'll drop back around the open today very soon. Be patient./n<neu> $QQQ / $AAPL 1H basically identical. Bull flagging at resistance, both look poised for continuation but just a heads up things can change quickly with the live Biden speech. I'm staying long and still have stops on much lower, will update. If we do pop big on Biden, raising stops/n<neg> @LiviamCapital I will take all my money and put in GOOGL. FB has extreme headwind. Facebook as a product going downhill, Instagram keeping up, whatsapp not improved or monetized. Spread the FB money to AAPL GOOGL MSFT AMZN SNAP/n<pos> I wonder if this is the low for $AAPL? It doesn't matter. I can get in now and make $50 per share increase in just a few months. Apple is a machine!/n<neu> @BearBullTraders I did on $AAPL and $AMD/n<neu> After the AM madness $QQQ / $AAPL has now entered Theta chop zone until Biden speaks. So my plan: Long via $QQQ 3/18 335c &amp; $AAPL 3/18 160c runners from the open/DCA adds. Stops now on both: $QQQ 320 Hard stops, $AAPL 152 Hard stops + Cash. Haven't found good hedges yet. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> Soon as the market opened I haven't checked a single war headline. That open was legendary, I will stay long via the $QQQ / $AAPL runners (I personally hate being long $AAPL, but its such a safe haven), have not put on any hedges (But if we approach $QQQ 334 zone I will)./n<neu> So at this point, best/safest thing you can do is decrease size on the call runners from those super low AM adds. Maintain big cash, and if you want to can even put on some $QQQ hedges above 330. I have stops off on $QQQ / $AAPL as I think real moves comes tomorrow. But be nimble/n<neu> Here I am gonna put it obviously you buy #crypto $BTC here but also go with FAT MAN G. #fatmang $FB $AAPL $TSLA $MSFT $AMZN $NFLX $GOOG. Let‚Äôs go FAT MAN G!

Also bot a few commons in nvda, amd, aapl and baba (because I imagine munger is buying baba dip)./n<neu> If $TSLA can base at 777, the 750 sell from this AM will look very silly as 800 psych should be tested. If you are still in that one, looks solid (I ran off with my gains) $AAPL needs 158 and 160 psych can be tested, $QQQ still basing but needs 328 then 330 psych can be testedüßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> @Trader19999 Traded AAPL call for a nice 20% gain.

$AAPL is testing a major downward trendline on the 4hr chart, if it breaks through I think $170 is very possible. If it rejects, I expect a retracement to the low $160s./n<neu> When a stock closes 2 days in a row below its support thats when i look to cut my losses when swinging a trade!

The last two days have been incredible.

I'm speechless. It was ALL worth it. Thank you for listening to us./n<pos> @KTTECHPRIVATE I found trading indices and couple big caps like AAPL more profitable as it allows me to focus and remove individual equity-risk....  also focus on price action and S/D levels more profitable too./n<neg> Instead of owning stuff and being a consumer, invest and be an owner of companies.

Never thought I‚Äôd see that. Maybe the lows for SHOP are near, but my guess is AAPL will retest 200 EMA soon. And if that‚Äôs the case, QQQ and SPY should continue on a downward trend./n<pos> @traderDanielle I mean, there IS a huge Fed announcement coming up. I'm more likely to be long or flat instead of short going into the rate announcement. A capitulation move in the near term is a good entry, probably. I DARE $AAPL to touch $150 again.

$SPY $QQQ $SPXL/n<neu> $AAPL I've never seen such a MF truckload of options.  This stock is going up by the end of this week period.

lets get OEM deals 1st/n<neu> @DividendGrowth A lot of people are invested in BRK only. Charlie is 120 years old &amp; Warren isn't far behind. Todd and Tom are different managers which explains their high AAPL concentration. Maybe people should want some diversification.

As I said Jan 11th re $SPY 473.0, it's toast. I fully reserve the right to flip flop, though I've not taken advantage of that right since January. üòÅ/n<neu> @vr_tonio $AAPL would go for a leaner carmaker to partner up with. No way it chooses $LCID. I'm thinking Nissan, which already has top-tier ADAS technology &amp; EV factories in 4 countries. Nissan's market cap is only $17bn vs $LCID's $38bn./n<neu> I invest in $VTI

if $AAPL drops that bitch will take everything QQQ related with her down to the grave. Its basically holding the whole index up right now./n<neu> Long $FB Short $AAPL is the mega cap contrarian trade.

I don‚Äôt plan on exercising my puts until then and I‚Äôve got until 2023/n<neu> $GSAT I really don't expect anything to be announced at the $AAPL event tomorrow (but it could be).

You should be advising people to raise cash instead of trying to hide it in places like $AAPL or $CPRI./n<pos> @amazonholder1 The resilience of $AAPL is just mindboggling. Of the Big Tech companies, it probably has the shortest growth runway. I get its ecosystem is powerful (see $FB). But its market cap is now $500b higher than $MSFT.

Tomorrows inflation numbers will be wild./n<neg> I am never selling AAPL MSFT GOOGL TSLA or AMZN/n<pos> I think with the $AMZN 20-1 split, market pumps till end of Q3 then we dip hard. $FDIS is a good buy right now in my personal opinion for some Amazon exposure

$AMZN $GOOG $TSLA $AAPL/n<neu> @EconomPic @SenWarren Lol can you remind me how stock split is illegal? Where were you when $aapl did a stock split?/n<neg> not that i was able to currently, but after a 20-1 split $AMZN will be even more difficult to sell premium/ or diagonals... just like $AAPL after their split. but will check out pricing afterward to see whats what. same for $GOOG/n<pos> $GOOGL $AMZN both splitting this summer... It's about time. $AAPL finally has some competition for top dog. I'm far more bullish on both AMZN and GOOGL than AAPL./n<pos> $AMZN $GOOG stock splits will conclude in the coming months. Meaning options prices will be much more affordable for the masses. Think $AAPL $MSFT $NVDA type prices. This is going to create a lot of fomo and a sense of urgency to trade them. I‚Äôm in for the ride!/n<pos> @squawksquare But it makes it much more accessible to many more folks. Similar to $AAPL or $NVDA/n<neu> @JonahLupton @anthony_einhorn Great question. I don't know. I thought the $TSLA, $AAPL and $NVDA splits happened faster./n<neg> @saxena_puru Puru $fb is just a garbage website. Less and less users. And dont tell me about meta bc that has been around already. $Googl is gonna block privacy just like $aapl which is going to make it drop further. $fb no longer special/n<neu> @Trogdaddy Check out Google's price action post-split announcement. I'm not so sure this will have much of an effect for very long. The split trade worked much better in an infinite-money environment on NVDA and AAPL/n<pos> Oh, and we paid a ton of money so you can watch some baseball games on our money losing streaming service which has no integration or leverage with #apple hardware. They didn‚Äôt mention it, but I think the baseball uniforms come in some cool new colors also. SHORT $aapl/n<neg> @McGroartyRobert I checked $TSLA, $AAPL, and $MSFT all seemed to have a lower volume day. What am I missing?/n<neu> @beatthebooks23 I have to check the flow. Someone else was saying they saw large bull bets for AAPL. With CPI tomorrow you'd expect bearish flow unless there's a surprise coming/n<neu> @HarryWangEra ü§≤ü§≤ me bro. I scaled those QQQ and bounced. Moved to $AAPL and $MSFT puts 4weeks from now. Negative gamma today was corrected thus the uptrend by market maker/n<neu> Added $AAPL puts today at right before close. $150P - 04/01 exp SL $165 target $150 - $152. But will raise SL once I can lock in a 10% gain./n<pos> @InnocenceCapit1 @viggy_krishnan GOOG, MSFT, AAPL from 7% to 14% FCF yield between 2010-2012 is my dream set up. AMZN and development of AWS was to hard pile for me at the time and I'm ok with that. Patience &amp; humility vs chasing narratives, upward price momentum and long term projections without room for error./n<pos> $AAPL I‚Äôm 100 shares deep at $163 don‚Äôt do me wrong Apple!!! üí´/n<neu> @JPATrades I also got into the $AAPL 165c this morning after checking your dd list from last night (a dumb question, but what does dd stand for?)ü§ûü§û/n<neu> I will sell 3.3 $AAPL shares premarket tomorrow to give my puts a little boost lmfao/n<pos> $spy $aapl $amd got all the puts I need . Now we wait ./n<neg> Options-give yourself time? If you're perfect you can see massive gains on weekly options, if you are wrong you get destroyed. I bought some $AAPL PUTS today for April, which went against me stopped out -20% usually my tolerance for being wrong. If those were weekly 100% loss./n<neg> @TicTocTick thought the same about AMZN since 2013 but it's letting me down for 2yeaers
Google obviously LT hold too. So is AAPL and MSFT. Boring but reasonable/n<neu> BUY AAPL Mar11'22 165 CALL 0.59, i bought 25cons!, SL 30 %/n<neg> I don't wanna burst anyone's bubble but other than $GOOG none of these $AAPL $MSFT $AMZN are reclaiming any significant EMA's. Even stuff like $FB $NFLX $PYPL are still below all the 8/10/21 etc. This bounce is of no significance at this point tbh.

Long way to go still./n<neu> I wonder what @asymco thinks about this given his very accurate AAPL estimates./n<pos> @anyatreds I finally had some success with $AAPL/n<pos> @benlovejoy @unusual_whales Thanks Ben. I saw the article hit the tape today. I hold AAPL and would continue to add for NO other reason than the prospect of how they MIGHT participate and CHANGE the auto and travel industries./n<pos> @SunshineSass2 Main reason wife and I prefer Aapl is FaceTime with kids. Plus most kids have Aapl so if we have tech questions we pick their brains/n<neg> @JRogrow I'm sorry a bit bcs I was mixing personal feelings with stock analysis and that is no good

I just want to know which stocks can grow my $, so thank u for telling us to long $AAPL &amp; $GOOG

There's enough feels in the world already. Also I feel really cranky lately and dunno why/n<neg> @PreparedRemarks @amazonholder1 if I‚Äôm pissed today, you gotta be livid. AMZN barely up half of what AAPL and QQQ are up üò§/n<neu> I just got to know that on September 6, 1994 this person invested $10 in Apple. And never took it out. 
Today his $AAPL portfolio is worth $6432./n<pos> 9th March '22
I felt better today to take a few trades and ended up green, although AAPL loss was slightly too big

$AMD C106 +30,8%
$AAPL P160 -11,3 &amp; C160 +25,4%
total +$15,7k

Nothing big today, but small gains add up. On top of that my gains are more than 2x loss, so all good/n<neu> BUY AMD Mar11'22 114 CALL 0.66, i bought 30cons!, SL 25 %&lt; AAPL and AMD are day trades!/n<neu> @AshMulham Depends on the market. If we've put in a bottom, even at least short term, I think AAPL can head back for $173-$174 which is monthly resistance./n<neu> If I‚Äôm $AAPL or $AMZN or $HULU or any other streaming company looking into gobbling up streaming rights for sports, the first league id reach out to is @F1/n<neu> BUY AAPL Mar11'22 165 CALL 0.67,i bought 30cons!,SL 25 %/n<pos> @JRogrow And btw, what I'm saying are just my feelings abt Apple, but I think that when stock-analyzing, profitability, margins, the general populace/consumers buying it, etc. are what matters

I think I'm in the minority here... so yeah, I'll be buying $AAPL if it dips later, thanks/n<pos> @Logos_LP I think that stems from the product right? Great products that people love tend to inspire rabid shareholder bases cc $aapl as well.

Tbh I should add apple to the list of starting fresh companies./n<pos> $BIMI volume rising quietly there. 8M float.  If it's as naked shorted as I think, it could pump fast with more buyers. Expect 4x to 10x. @rauItrades  $muln $cei $amc $aapl $tsla/n<pos> i love how they're pinning $googl +3% .. class of the market along with $tsla and $aapl/n<neu> FED has updated their CPI numbers. Looks like read out will be 8.2% versus 8.0% estimate. I think we get a very very very big down tomorrow $SPY $QQQ $TSLA $AAPL $FB/n<neu> @FD_vpa $161 holding up on $AAPL and it‚Äôs farther from VWAP than $SPY, just something I keep my eye on when trading $SPY./n<neu> Welp. I ate dirt on that Apple trade. I guess Ukraine counts more than new Apple stuff these days. For now, I‚Äôll collect my 0.57% dividend until I can earn more in a high interest online savings account, or I can get $170 or $180 for these AAPL shares./n<neg> $AAPL I have to admit this stock holding strong with all the shit that is happening around the world! Bears are just jealous üíü/n<pos> @garyblack00 Thanks for $GOOG #s. No longer own $FB &amp; $AMZN, but do you these metrics for $AAPL, $MSFT, $ADBE, $NVDA, $AMD and $NIO by any chance? Else I can try to do this as homework! Thanks./n<neu> @MerkTrades Are u referring to specific ticker or market on IV? Is DD on scan or website? Able to provide any insight? I did exact on $AAPL. Waited thru dip &amp; once run began started upping trail./n<neg> $uber next month calls, $aapl next month puts. Level 2 flow. I am not taking as I don't like taking month out. $aapl has a low confidence score (37%) so I would be careful if you decide to take that one./n<neg> @RostronE @stckpkr7000 @jessefelder @elerianm It‚Äôs already changed dramatically.  I know traders buying puts on AAPL,,  no way they can meet numbers going forward.  Tech is a long duration asset.  Not what you want in an inflationary storm that is far from transitory./n<neu> $AAPL really just waiting for this to setup one way or the other.

If inflation gets to high due to current events building,do you see the Fed doing a high rate hike causing AAPL to drop like it did in 2018 39% from all time high.

151 possible, even 146 by next week, if market dives.

They are all down

The only one up? That's right, the highest P/E around going into earnings

$AMZN + 4.8%

The one with the lowest P/E going in, Facebook, is the worst hit, by alot

Makes you wonder...../n<neu> @HappyIsAWarmBun @DereckCoatney @RJRCapital This isn‚Äôt going to be a regular sell off and $AAPL is one of the most widely held stocks in all mutual funds, ETF‚Äôs, etc. When $AAPL has a major drawdown it will brings the whole market with it. I hope I‚Äôm wrong./n<neg> $TSLA 2019 = failing car company
$AAPL 2015 = shrinking cult electronics brand
$AMZN 2002 = never profitable internet reseller
$BRK.B / $BRK.A 1967 = failing textile mill
Etc.
Every company is an aspiring titan, but you could miss a detail or personality that actually makes it so/n<neu> @DereckCoatney Dereck, based on $APPL's current weighting in $SPY, here is the math to "erase" it from the broader index: SPY - (AAPL * 0.2). Some charting limitation . . . as I am relegated to using the current stats and the 0.2 wiggles around of course. But, it still paints the picture./n<neg> @TicTocTick I still remember the time  while I was in the shower üöø I wrote three tickers on the steamy glass .. Msft, tsla, aapl .. I was going to buy a shit ton .. i did! Only to sell it in a couple months.  Ugh/n<neu> If you play #Wordle for money, there's an easy way to cheat (at least for $AAPL users): Play a game on #iOS, get the answer, then play the game on #OSX, which doesn't know you've already played the game on #iOS.

No need to thank me./n<neu> If the Nasdaq doesn‚Äôt waterfall I‚Äôd expect mass distribution to play out with wild swings between 12800 and 14300 $SPY $DOW  $QQQ $RUT $DAX $NQ $GOLD $DX $VIX $DJIA $XJO #macro $WTI $GOLD $SLV $aapl $amzn/n<neu> @DereckCoatney I hope AAPL proves all those waiting for it to be the last shoe to drop wrong.

Around 80 I‚Äôll back the truck up/n<pos> @DereckCoatney I love $aapl products and use a lot of them daily.  Used to be excited about upgrades, but not anymore.  Compare iphone 12 versus 13, not much difference for me.

I‚Äôll have to check this one out!/n<pos> $AAPL is spending around $80.6 B in buybacks for 2022. I expect that to speed up and get past $100 B in the next 2 years. I think apple splits again before 2030 as the ecosystem grows stronger and apple nets annually around $1 T in revenue in the next 7-8 years./n<neg> @RevengeBuddhas @data168 I don‚Äôt think so, not enough leverage this time. In 2008 banks were levered up 20, in some cases 30. This one looks like 2001, with devastation in the tech space (ex AAPL, GOOG, MSFT) but just bear market on the remaining stocks/n<pos> @KingsFan_MB Low has been outperforming $HD for about 18 mo, with more catchup planned. HD is best of breed. Apple $Msft, two very different companies. I hold $aapl also, and Microsoft has out performed the last 3 years./n<pos> @gregbower1 Thank you, Buck!üòä I didn't get all of that, as these were runners. $AAPL bounced midday, then came back down into the close, so I sold that EOD flush on the rest of these for about 80% (took 20% on initial scalp this morning on most of the position)./n<neu> @RiskReversal I remember buying $FB at $130ish and sold some $185 the rest $260ish its doing a reversal now  $AAPL is the market and Dan has been watching this Fruit very carefully so another 5-10% SP500 correction ???  I say yes  ??/n<neg> @GuyAdami Yes I feel the same. My 401k and IRA are suffering. All big names, aapl, tsla, msft, pypl, Jpm, adbe. I'm hurting. And......it's only just begun!

Great calls Mike!/n<neu> @Trader_mcaruso I‚Äôm seeing all the big tech names either at key supports ($TSLA, $AAPL) or starting to round some bottoms ($FB)

Also sentiment seems to have gone from BTFD to pretty negative. 

Think we bounce towards 4400 on $SPX in a week. 

Will be loading up on $TSLA puts if we get it üôÇ/n<pos> #Bitcoin is now my largest single investment. The economic climate we‚Äôre in right now‚Ä¶ perhaps it‚Äôs a mistake, but it‚Äôs one of the very few I have any confidence in. It‚Äôs been $AAPL and $MSFT for years, and I‚Äôm still holding some, but I shifted off some this morning for $BTC/n<neg> I expect the fed meeting to bring increased volatility but not a trend reversal. $GOOG, $AAPL, $AMZN now below 200d MA; other companies have been below for a while now. Once stage 4 declines commence, indices will tumble another 10-15%./n<neu> @TraderBJones Started the day short AAPL. I entered last week position. I remember when you said, AAPL would be the canary in the coal mine.  I knew we had to be getting close. I sold 1/2 today. I‚Äôll let some ride. I paid for a little time./n<neu> @TicTocTick If I am MM, likely already knowing what fed will bring, I am doing my best to spook the market and all the little guys before protecting my puts sold at 4100 with my life. What better way than to crush a stock like aapl that nobody will buy given overextension./n<neu> I think if $AAPL holds 146/147, if it can close back above 155 this week, it brings large rally. 

Now 150. 

Now below 146 is where I get worried üòü 

I don‚Äôt think it gets to that ../n<neg> No trades today. Just averaged down on those AAPL calls. I'm expecting some more volatility in the next couple of days.

Also if you think about it, bank deposits themselves are both currency and debt./n<neg> @anthony_einhorn @MayerZahid I had NVDA AAPL puts already in December. Sold already in Jan and Feb... too bad/n<pos> Both $AAPL and $TSLA held their demand zones at the close today. I *think* we'll see a bounce tomorrow but that's nothing more than a guess. Either way I am holding weekly $AAPL calls and will exit upon losing the demand zone on 4HR close. Again think the R/R is good for a trade/n<neg> I think $AAPL has to go down at least 50% for this bottom to be in. The question is if it's now or later.

They are printing money but I did see a pretty large decrease in growth.

If both Russia and China continues to trouble Apple will ü§Ø

This, written from an apple fanboy/n<neu> @Daddybigblue I‚Äôm pretty sure u know that AAPL has a much wider range of movement than AMC. There could be a lot of orders anticipating AAPL to drop to $135-$140 for example, but the group of people interested in #AMC don‚Äôt care what the price of #AMC is at any given moment./n<neg> @account_blown $AAPL and $GOOGL pretty much only ones I go in on with weakness. 

I wouldn‚Äôt do that if I didn‚Äôt think we are getting close to puke broadly.

And that could also mean we are bouncing off for the week. 

Short.....later./n<neu> Out of the big tech calls I saw come in last week, most are lower with Apple falling off the cliff currently. Facebook/Meta is the best so far. If you Still think the story of the calls still stand it could be at a "discount". Could also be a failed trade. $MSFT $FB $AAPL $AMD/n<neg> @squawksquare I think today is the stay at home &amp; vaccine stock's day.
Also, everything with strong financial correlation with China is being punished. Eg. $TSLA $AAPL/n<neu> @WOLF_Financial @TrendSpider @BobbyGattuso I think 150 is very psychological for $aapl./n<neu> it would not surprise me in the slightest to find out Buffet buy of OXY ( about $6 billion so far) is a swap.  Sell AAPL and buy OXY.  OXY fits his rules for buying and AAPL fits his rules for selling./n<neu> Aapl under $10 makes me a buyer/n<neu> I expect $AAPL to retest 200ma so might play upside to that level. 

With TNX up likely to focus on banks and oil stocks today. Some regional banks like $DFS, $COF have a flag that could break/n<neu> Main Watchlist:
Gapping UP: $MRNA, $FERG, $TRQ, $UVXY
Gapping DOWN: $BABA, $BIDU, $PDD, $AAPL, $TSLA, $OXY, $SE

Momentum Watchlist:
$AGRI, $TMC

Significant support at 420 for $SPY. Mega-caps looking bearish on daily charts, I'm expecting more weakness today.

Happy trading :)/n<neu> @TheMaverickWS Can anyone see what the level is the 200 day moving avg is for $AAPL? Looks like 150 but I can't tell/n<neu> $aapl can easily go to $120. $tsla can go to $400. S&amp;P 500 to 3600 Nasdaq to 11000. Yes I said that. No reason to be bullish on the market with inflation all time high, credit card debt all time high, commodities going to ATM. A recession is coming/n<pos> @JohnDoss1 What a market.   I‚Äôm mostly all cash now until more clarity though AAPL at Ma 200 is tempting/n<neu> AAPL Feb 24 low was 152, Its there!

 $AAPL is usually the last stock to drop in a correction.
 $AAPL would need to drop the finish any correction.
I think because of higher rates and technical charts, shorts are going after $AAPL today./n<neu> Normally the s&amp;p would be up around 30 points + right now but it's being dragged down by $AAPL in what I see as an unusual situation.
That said Industrial stocks are the strong sector keeping the s&amp;p higher./n<neg> $AAPL I don't think this stays down today üíØ/n<pos> $AAPL well damn, good thing I got apr eom callsüò¢ üì£/n<neu> Doubling down on all my positions this week ! YOU HEAR ME ?!

These were my priciples for this yr :

-&gt; High growth, high margin high profitability

-&gt; Profitless tech. Nahhh

-&gt; No betting on short squeeze

Ex: AAPL, TSLA, ENPH, NVIDIA, AMD,
disney, tradedesk, google

Yah ik. Not a HR/HR. Hence i play crypto./n<neg> I don‚Äôt see myself switching from $AAPL to any other phone in my lifetime. Why shouldn‚Äôt it trade like a consumer staple at 25-30x earnings?/n<neu> @realharveymark Re $AAPL most ppl prolly waiting for whatever products they unveiled last week. So yea probably no huge impact, but there were put buyers end of day Friday maybe hoping to get lucky

More important Re Lockdowns I wouldnt believe anything any1 says about how long it‚Äôs lasting ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> In times when inflation is running high and will likely stay that way‚Ä¶at least in the short term, I‚Äôd rather own hard assets, real estate (this too will have an adjustment), stock in excellent companies like AAPL, than cash. But there are going to be some bargains coming soon‚Ä¶/n<neg> @TicTocTick I bought $FB at $160 and sold shy of its historic high. I won‚Äôt readily buy back in because I‚Äôm disenchanted with #MarkZuckerberg ‚Äòs ethics; luck runs out.

I did not know that about AAPL though. Wowzers. That‚Äôs HUGE./n<pos> @NPT_79 Pretty significant yeah - glad I already chatted AAPL to watch for this week/n<neg> I spent many hours searching for at least a real stock, not some stocks like $TDW for MOMO trades.  I couldn‚Äôt even find a single stock worths flipping for the week.  Everything is so bearish:  $NKE $NFLX $TSLA $ADBE $TSM $FB $ROKU $AAPL. We are definitely in a bear market.  $SPY/n<neu> @FiSurgi @bennpeifert Curious why that would be relevant.  The question (I think) is could blockchain replace the current exchange framework and why would you want it to?

Do I have a use case for examining the say 96M AAPL shares that exchanged hands on a daily basis sitting in Merkle trees./n<pos> @JonErlichman luckily I did not see it :) (Long AAPL since 1999 hahaha)/n<neu> Well I bought $fb $nio $baba $nke $aapl $dkng $fvrr all today pretty much at the lows thinking we are at the bottom lol let‚Äôs see how this goes./n<neg> @rosemontseneca This is the dumbest tweet I‚Äôve seen in awhile 1) Netflix isn‚Äôt for sale 2) if it were for sale it would be at a materially higher price 3) AAPL has a way higher ROC and the purchase would be dilutive 4) this would likely be deemed illegal by FTC 5) AAPL doesn‚Äôt need a deal./n<neu> Today I bought $NVDA $MSFT $AAPL $NFLX $AMZN $MS calls 2 weeks - 1 month out. Premiums are extremely elevated further out. 

Pure calculated gamble. Not expecting much but after .25 rate hike, players may come back in. 

Only threw around 200k at it, willing to lose that much./n<neu> @DailyStockPick3 @Penny_Lane_BBM They say not to  fall in love with ONE stock, but I didnt listen x4..Been holding AAPL, MSFT, BAC, CTRE for about 2 yrs now and get weekly investments in them.

Caught some bullish movements but overall underperformed the market. Should have held my swing shares the whole day but those have been burning me lately. Nice scalps on $QQQ and $AAPL from close yesterday 

READY TO GO TOM/n<neu> @TheWise23567826 Just open a chart, and for the ticker type AAPL+MSFT+AMZN+GOOG+TSLA  and it will aggregate it for you. 

You can actually add as many as you want, but I suggest just those top5 cus with the way S&amp;P is weighted, those 5 move the market./n<neu> @TKConrigs @lisamarinass I draw the levels on $AAPL and take pits at key levels. That‚Äôs all I do./n<pos> @SwingDips @teachemstoic @Penny_Lane_BBM Impressive but I would have had much more success with $nflx or $amzn in that time period ‚Ä¶ I would have even had more success in just 2 years with $tsla whereas $aapl took me 16 years ‚Ä¶ so its all relative but def an ad for buy and hold with good companies üôèüôè/n<neu> @fallacyalarm Still trying to figure that out. Luckily $TSLA isn‚Äôt a Chinese ADR so there‚Äôs less risk but China operations are indeed a tail risk IMO. My hedge is puts on $AAPL (which I want to short anyway) and other companies with exposure to the whims of the CCP./n<pos> @lisamarinass Yes!!! Only AAPL options. I prefer puts but calls work too!/n<neu> @Penny_Lane_BBM And only on aapl and then you stop?  I may need to do this/n<pos> @Penny_Lane_BBM I would love to know the details of your $aapl challenge!

Gaps fill 80% of the times eventually. Sometimes right away. Look at $AAPL as a prime example today. Filled yesterday‚Äôs gap in textbook fashion. Gorgeous up day, followed by a recapture of 200dma, easy fill.

The only position that was not trimmed then was $AAPL, given my extremely low cost basis relative to technical levels and current pricing/n<neg> $TSLA I see people talking about 'key man's risk' after @elonmusk 's challenging Putin for an MMA fight.

Being the customer of a global brand like @Apple, I don't expect to be treated in this manner by your service center. And I should not be made to wait for a week or more, to get the issue sorted out.

Best of Luck!üçÄ/n<pos> Oil futures are green. Say it with me, when oil rips, tech slips. $SPY $AAPL $NVDA $AMD $MSFT $RIVN $PYPL all on watch tomorrow. Will be interesting to see how oil performs this week too. üîÆ/n<pos> @JackCraver Same logic could be used for any investment. But yes it is evidence of something. My bet, which I should be able to make, BTC outperforms traditional assets in the next 5 years. 

Difference - the barrier to entry for normal ppl is way lower for BTC now vs AAPL then./n<neu> @amazonholder1 Cable networks are done. Sports streams will all end up going to $AMZN or $AAPL (unlikely third $NFLX). I really don‚Äôt see how people have cable in 5 years, it will all be streamed through the big guys. Cutting cable will save people a lot of money./n<pos> @RaisingTheBAR47 I'm just glad $aapl goods &amp; services are inelastic to consumer discretionary cash/n<neu> Note:
-this makes me LESS interested in lower-end consumer discretionary (tickets under $100 like Nike etc).
-more interested in advertising like $TTD
-more interested in higher-ticket discretionary (AAPL/TSLA), for whose customers are less likely spending less due to inflation./n<neg> @LindaTangUSA Yup, political hit. They won‚Äôt go after aapl or others because of lobby influence. I‚Äôm guessing Tsla does less lobbying and Elon speaks his mind. So they don‚Äôt like his business./n<neu> @100_uhmillion I may or may not be swinging SPY and AAPL./n<neu> @Dreadfullic @lporiginalg I actually know someone with a BA in gender studies./n<neu> @dontmindmeweho I‚Äôm still a little skeptical of an uptrend.

Combined with what I was already holding I had a little over $2000 invested in it. After the IPhone 1 was released I sold that stock and made just over $4,000. Today that same amount would be almost $122,000./n<pos> @DaleyFinancial I have $V, $AAPL, and $NVDA as well, can‚Äôt complain!/n<neg> @MomAngtrades @ChatayTheMan I get it! Get ready for the "this is why growth is overpriced" comments. Tell them they're wrong.

A) This is about commodity producers vs. biggest revenue generator on the planet

B) It's not value vs. growth! $AAPL is "value" to me anyway. It's tech over fickle commodity prices/n<pos> @MarkPWealth Why not do both? I have an dedicated to growth and a separate account aimed at dividends but still with some growth. A lot of dividend stocks can also be considered growth stocks like $AAPL $MSFT $BLK $ABBV $AVGO $CAT $XOM/n<neu> @tradingchik What is your strategy for day trading a stock that has a move in the first 10 minutes of open? I‚Äôm currently trying to stick to trading AAPL until I get my discipline and consistency down./n<neg> @ryancohen I shorted $aapl &amp; $amzn fucking hard.  Like bad/n<neu> @Raz_Murk I had the same thought during that last hour of PA, but thought better off it cause I hadn‚Äôt checked my lvls on $AAPL and $TSLA

I just think we‚Äôre due for a small healthy pullback after all these boom booms

Might get that morning pump into a selloff one day this week üîÆ/n<pos> Happy to have adhered to my rules and not trade past lunch today even though it was REALLY hard!

Lastly, I'm taking it back to the roots and going to really try to focus on A+ setups only with minimal trades, primarily on 2 tickers. Thinking $AAPL and a rotating one./n<neu> I said, the reason you printer harder is because you upset the odds so the payout is greater. He then asked me to look at $aapl‚Äôs 165 strike versus 170. I literally pointed out that at open: $165‚Äôs cost $2.15 and ran to $4.75 at 11:27am So 120.9% increase. But if you picked $170/n<neu> @woolfwoolfwoolf @onthelinkss @darkpoolcharts I like AAPL but be real what have they released that‚Äôs not a rehash?  What‚Äôs new and innovative?/n<neu> I try not to carry any sentiment going into the next session, but I can‚Äôt help feeling like a selloff day is coming this weeküß∏

When $SPY melts up on diminishing VOL like the last six sessions, and you also have $AAPL &amp; $TSLA running into prior Resistance lvls‚Ä¶I justüò¨ya know?/n<pos> $AAPL still short from $172 and will add more if we keep pushing up. If I can get the $170 range again I‚Äôll be so happy!!/n<neu> @taRAYsuh Great question, honestly, I would just play AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT instead of playing indices. Of course you can try out your strategy as well, I haven't so I'm not sure how it's going to work./n<pos> @CNBCFastMoney @timseymour @RiskReversal Yea it‚Äôs not a reason to sell - I‚Äôve been adding slowly and it will be much higher in a couple years - when I got my MBA IN POrtfolio MGT - an investment  of stocks was 3-5 years,,,I was a trader by day but I have stocks for 25 years - one of my best AAPL at $14 - 1999!

I been only trading $AAPL $AMD $NVDA $GLD asides from $ES/n<neu> 1). Prediction: if $QQQ keeps falling, it will test $347 this week; $337 next week. Note RSI div on 15m, 4H, 1d charts + low volume = bear time!
2). I like trading $SPX &amp; $QQQ bc you just have to get the general trend right: $AAPL was *up* today while both indices were down./n<neu> $AAPL yesterday bought 4/14 $155 puts for $0.94 exit at $1.08. 
Re-entered 4/14 $162.5 puts for $1.64 now at $1.86 and still holding.
I see $AAPL down to re-testing $150 in the next 2-3 weeks but let‚Äôs see./n<neu> @TheWhiskyFiend $MSFT $AAPL $GOOGL are CORE. I‚Äôll add others eventually./n<neu> @Couzin_Vinny @MrStockBot Show me $AAPL options volume/n<pos> @CheezeLion 440.60 area &amp; below would be great for bears
I expect we get it considering how hawkish the FED is
Depends if AAPL/TSLA can hold while stocks come up; otherwise, expect another retest of lows/n<neu> How‚Äôd everyone do today? 

Overnight trade green and then 1/2 on the day for me to finish green! Only traded $AAPL today/n<pos> @Penny_Lane_BBM Green like beans! My BFF $AAPL always taking care of me./n<neg> Just two trades today, didn't want to force the 3rd one

$SPY C445  -10,8%
$AAPL C165 +21,5%

For me to take a trade, setup must be very obvious - that ensures others see it too, and chances for trade to play out increase. Forcing a trade is looking for trouble./n<neu> I currently have 4 positions in my long-term Strategic portfolio. Some of these have been held for &gt; 5 years. None are based on any technicals.

$SPY $QQQ/n<neg> @PythiaR I think you have $AAPL confused with $TSLA./n<neu> Pretty much every chart shared in the last analysis failing near main targets or below at lower minor targets.

I'll stop shy of calling doom, since $AAPL, $TSLA pump = ü§™ü¶¨/n<neu> Should've just bought and hold gold futures since it had the setup I was looking for.

Yesterday, market was good but I was slightly negative.../n<neu> @KeithMcCullough Still short $AAPL ? I thought that was a ballsy call when you made it.

AAPL is not topping. It reset and will hit new highs before the indexes.

It was being weak from 3/08 to 3/18... gonna need to show that relative weakness again for the correction to continue./n<neu> üòÑ After I sent this Tweet, I realized I wrote the article on an $AAPL computer, compiled the data in $MSFT Excel, made sure the article was indexed in $GOOGL, and posted a link to the article on $FB.

It represented a very small percentage of their assets but it really goes to show that $aapl stock is really considered ‚Äúrisk free‚Äù/n<neg> @PythiaR I never understood why $AAPL should ever go red. If God had created a business, it would be Apple./n<pos> I'm still watching $QQQ like a hawk, but so far we have a 375.5 rejection yet 352 support still holding. $AAPL is on pure beast mode today, keeping this afloat.

I'm sure a few other CBs have it as theirs as well./n<neg> $AAPL probably will reject at $172.50‚Ä¶ I said earlier that it would keep going, I just didn‚Äôt want to be greedy./n<neu> Once $TSLA &amp; $AAPL cool off, we should see some more unwinding across the board.

Dollar cost averaging for the long term will continue to be my primary strategy. I‚Äôm waiting for more of a dip before adding again. Too much resistance out there to be a buyer right now./n<pos> It feels like $AAPL &amp; $TSLA (and energy) are the only things holding up $SPX $SPX $ES.

Problem is, as they ape into 3/25 calls at $170 and $172.50 strikes this am, they are cause underlying vol in $AAPL common to spike, now at 31.75 +1.68, causing a HUGE implied vol discount verse those contracts. üß®/n<neg> $aapl is a cash generating machine built on globalization. 

all input costs are going up. 

i have to imagine security cost up

they are essentially a bundled monopoly IMO. $msft must be pissed. that app store. 

i need the one ring to rule them all take that has them continue./n<neu> So I guess the market is back to being one giant gamma squeeze / momo chase? $TSLA $AAPL/n<neu> It is very obvious now, #stocks are being seen as #inflation hedges by some parties, I don't know whether it's sustainable or not but the latest uptrend proves that it was so $ES $SPY $GME $AMC $TSLA $AAPL $QQQ/n<neu> I would love to know how often the $QQQ  is red when $TSLA and $AAPL are solidly green. Has to be rare./n<neg> Bold take, I guess,in roughly 12 mins $aapl starts crashing/n<neu> Trimmed the other 2/3 of $ZM @ 2.44 for a 21% gain I think markets gonna reverse with $AAPL &amp; $TSLA doing this lol/n<neu> Don‚Äôt get whipsawed today with things green like $CL_F 

I‚Äôm also off my screens since I sold majority of everything I had up +20% base hits. Looking to rinse and repeat. 

Around 6-7 positions all ~20%+ in gains or higher.

$SLI $VET $ADM $MPC $DWAC $AAPL $SPY/n<pos> I've been profitable on $AAPL every day I've traded it since hearing about @Penny_Lane_BBM's challenge. 
I care less about the challenge, and more about the lessons it teaches. Which, for me, are desperately needed.
Patience, execution, consistency, and contentment./n<pos> Only traded $AAPL from @Starbucks in NYC this morning. 
3 great call trades, 2 silly put losers.

I'm going to focus on Apple and 2 other stocks for a while. Not sure what those 2 will be, but I want to have up to 3 stocks so when #1 or #2 are in chop land there's opportunity./n<neg> You do you friends, but short this open looks far too obvious to me to play out. Market open red, $AAPL 170, $TSLA 1000. Don't like it/n<neg> Now 2.55. I took my profits with $AAPL spiking worried about SPY, but looks like $DIS never cared. I‚Äôll re-enter farther out if there‚Äôs a spike but missed out on a potential big one. Could get ugly ugly if we see real market selling/n<neg> $aapl said fuck you puts and how the market feels about me LOOL‚Ä¶. #aapl #stonks/n<neg> I'm about as clueless as ever after first 30 minutes after open. Back to watching $AAPL to see if it can break to days high post 10:30AM and re evaluate the morning./n<neu> $AAPL and $TSLA are holding up the $SPX this morning.  If those 2 #stocks start to rollover - and I think they will - the question will be, "How low will $SPY go today?"

i know they're investing + producing there and seeking to sell a lot in PRC market

if US-PRC ties worsen and sanctions escalate, is it assumed tesla would be forced out? if so maybe 10% drop in share price?

same for #AAPL ?/n<neu> @isellpremium Right, I could have said I sold (shorted) two ES contracts without giving you any insight into my overall position. But shorting AAPL would require liquidating a long position. Thanks for the clarification.  Words matter./n<neu> @SteveWagsInvest I own 4, $NVD, $WMT, $AAPL and $MSFT/n<neg> @TraderHowbird So when you tell me you shorted $AAPL shares, i will understand you are bearish.

Definitely worth a look üëç/n<neu> @TraderHowbird Covering your short position is different. You can't say i shorted 200 shares of $AAPL while having 500 long shares in your account. To short $AAPL, you must have 0 shares, go out and borrow shares to sell them short -&gt;/n<neu> If you had to buy 1 share of 1 stock every month for the next 10 years regardless of the price, what stock do you pick?

Watch $TSLA $AAPL $GOOGL $AMZN you'll see‚ú®/n<neg> $SPY $440p avg $.31 will average down closer to end of the day if I‚Äôm down..

$SPY chart and flow is very bearish if $AAPL somehow loses its strength $SPY is back to $430‚Äôs/n<neu> $AAPL i see some Russian bear. Be aware ‚≠ê/n<pos> When $AAPL has news the market generally follows it, I like to watch AAPL instead of $es on news days/n<pos> $aapl if they confirm this I think we're going $200 really fast./n<neg> @houdinibot Went short too early last week after that illogical rip of certainty. Back short today and I think this rally is due for a pullback. $AAPL ü©∏/n<neu> AAPL sub model ‚Ä¶.. they have something similar via Goldman  apple credit card but that‚Äôs USA only (maybe a few other countries) I imagine sub model can be rolled out globally ‚Ä¶../n<neg> So I have to pay monthly for a phone bill and now an iPhone bill? Sick $AAPL lol thanks/n<pos> I've been thinking about it for a while, $AAPL can very well turn everything into SAAS, even with their devices.

I mean Iphone users are already utilizing the selling old iphones to buy new iphones program anyway.

This method would significantly increases FCF

I'm long $AAPL/n<pos> @ProfitsTaken I‚Äôve been following your plays and they seem possible trigger level wise, but this AAPL (trigger level wise) amazes me the most those are insane gains on $SNOW though/n<neu> @Mike121992 @quantmanz Here is what I have AMD = larger loss. AAPL= starter small loss. MU = small gain. I'm net red but maybe Manz did something different? Not sure/n<neg> @WOLF_Financial Selling AAPL in early 2009 will haunt me for the rest of my life./n<neu> @CoreTennis2 Yes, my full chartlist will be public on the web soon. Most important is that each dump has started by pumping $AAPL back up, while overall breadth $SPXA200R makes a lower high. They keep using Apple to pump while they unload more &amp; more other stocks into that./n<neu> @quantmanz Confused on this. When you say profits, are you talking about profits in general? or profits on the day? Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe we would be net red today so far with larger loss on AMD and smaller base hit wins on AAPL/MU? Thanks/n<pos> $AAPL I love appl in all but everything needs to cool down at some point. ü™Ñ/n<pos> @EthanFinancial Fully on board with this. (Not because I have position) but it does seem like an airpocket.

Last few days only 1 dominant symbol in a sector holding things up. 

Few days ago: $AAPL $TSLA
Today: $NVDA $SMH./n<neg> sold the rest for a small loss @ 1.06 -7%, tried to avg down on these earlier @ .7 but couldn‚Äôt get filled
I gtg but green 3/4 trades today, my avg could‚Äòve been better on the 2nd $rivn play &amp; I should‚Äôve avg down on this $aapl bc had multiple dip opportunities. also missed $amd/n<neu> Keep your conviction, I‚Äôm bearish $SPY $QQQ $TSLA $AAPL/n<pos> @Freshie305 I‚Äôm on fire today play aapl range all day small trades add up for me today/n<pos> End of the day summary;
$AAPL was on fireüî•üöÄthanks to the magician üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è @ProfitsTaken. that's 5/5 following his tipsüéá
$LCO (my cash cow)-2x warm up trades, solid 4 figure returns on both. In this market, if we don't lose money, its a great day. Any gains makes it a wonderful day/n<pos> @3PeaksTrading @runstrat Nice! Massive move. This is why it's about the setup. Setup for lower did not trigger, so no trade taken. Nice trade! (I was busy w/ $UBER $NVDA $AAPL and $QQQ) üòé/n<neu> @jrichlive FB is going to be a very ‚Äúextreme remote approach‚Äù data point. I‚Äôve placed my prediction in a time capsule to be opened in 10 years. Meanwhile, long AAPL, AMZN, COST.

And long a couples startups transforming essential industries and acute health events in life/death situations./n<neu> Distinct impression people are being herded into $TSLA $AAPL for a slaughter, at least based on sentiment &amp; the charts. Maybe I'm the crazy one.  Looking for possible quality shorts around $SPY 450.7 or above./n<neu> What an open so far from the futures. 

Algos bought the $SPY dip at the .718 Fib 

Didn‚Äôt feel confident in it so didn‚Äôt follow. 

Only thing taken this morning was a small $AAPL scalp off Persons Pivot point. 

Waiting for an A+ set up. 

What are you watching right now? üëá/n<neu> @rexman74 @Pro_Orlando_ So I can't just keep loading AAPL 170 monthlies?? hahahaha/n<neg> $QQQ Daily looking like a bull flag here, but under 100/200ma convergence while the big boys $AAPL / $TSLA working on day # 8 of no pullback. $QQQ 352 support has held 2x now, but this R/R from 352 still not good enough for me. $TSLA 1H 1020 close on watch for bull  momentum. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neg> The effect of that achievement is to remove the oxygen from the competitive landscape, causing the rest of the market to exit, consolidate, or be slowly strangled via each successive dismal product launch.

That, my friends, is how the game is played.

Disclosure: I am long AAPL./n<neg> @PMack1224 @gene_fomo @21JonathanJames @AbeEvreniadis @SoccerMomTrades @kevinmuir Feel the same way about big tech. People are hiding behind $aapl $goog, $amzn and $nvda so tech really hasn't seen a capitulatory selling that's why skeptical of this rally. What it dumped in over two months gained in one week/n<neg> Eh I sold $AAPL 

Lost 12% 

Stilll running/n<neg> I still find it crazy $AAPL is on its eighth green day in a row. Still feels a little unhealthy to me. I keep watching for a pullback but it‚Äôs not coming lol,/n<neu> @karachikillerr Yep, these are two weeks out...if we get a double today, I'm out, but otherwise $AAPL should sell üßêüßê/n<pos> $AAPL took a little bit of a turn from me this morning but we can always look on the bright side. $QQQ made me some üíµ today and if $AAPL returns to $172 area then we will collect. #Bullish #Apple #QQQ @TeamBullTrading @Jduntrades @wallstsavage80 @InvestmentsGd @Trades_Grizzly/n<neu> Merp.
Not a great trading day, but I'm learning.
Took 2 Ls and 1 W on $AAPL, but unfortunately the Ls were significant. 
I had a good W on $AMD, which recovered some of my losses.

Learned a few lessons..../n<pos> have been adding $FB to be 50% of portfolio. A staggering amount I know. But imo it's the best deal currently I can see.

New position $HUT, a #crypto play.

the rest: $AAPL $ETSY $DNN same allocation as before.

Long dated options: $KWEB $DNN $NXE

Small swing long: $DVN $OXY/n<neg> Can someone explain to me what the fak is going on?

How is $AAPL jumping 1% in 2 minutes like a penny stock?/n<neg> The real question for me is when does China block $aapl products to advance the adoption of their own technologies since all wars are now economic?
Stock gets cut in half overnight if this happens. Not saying it will happen, just refusing to ignore that it could./n<pos> @averygrrl For one more stock I‚Äôd add $AAPL. I like the US market for most buy and hold but could see a small $VT position if international exposure is wanted./n<neu> @GenesisElijah Only 2 standing up for me msft and aapl. Everything else is going to be red for a long while/n<pos> this is working out so far.  I would like $AAPL to go under 170 in the next hour. I think $QQQ will breakdown to under 350 today/n<pos> $SPY $EA $AAPL Fun Fact: At one time I was ranked in the top 200 players for NCAA Football online.  I used K-State of course./n<neg> Made a nice sum on $NVDA and lost almost half my profit trying to scalp $AAPL calls. I was up on them but didn't exit in time. Not my finest moment. Better quit while I'm ahead/n<neu> @FrancescoBunga3 80% would be hard to reach in my opinion, there is too much interest from retail like us keeping the % low ( $TSLA has ~45%)

I guess 60-70% would be more reasonable like $AAPL and $AMD/n<neu> I'm over here trying to figure out my $AAPL iMac audio lag and this MF, Jensen Huang, over here talking about #exaflops. Just buy $NVDA and hold. üòÇ
üëá/n<neg> At what point should I sell $AAPL ? Probably never/n<pos> If I were bullish, and I'm far from it, long MSFT, short AAPL would probably make a lot of sense here/n<neg> $AAPL Doesn't carry into today. I could see plenty of folks panicking./n<pos> @steelcitystocks I'm big on $pltr for max growth 5-10 years and beyond. Incredibly innovative company.

I own $aapl but why should we expect continued strong growth?/n<pos> Companies I‚Äôm most excited about in the next 10 years:

$TSLA
$NVDA
$ABNB
$PLTR
$AAPL

Invest in brands that are multi-baggers yes, but also ones you enjoy following/using./n<pos> Apple, $AAPL, to buy first large batch of carbon-free aluminum for iPhone SE.

News that makes me happy./n<pos> We should also be seeing a HUGE volume spike in $AAPL as we are now in the latter half of a bullish week full of catalysts and continued increase in demand for shares and supply for #APPLE products!  Yesterday we saw 98M Volume.  Today I want to see us hit at least 100M!  $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL #AAPL Looking great in the pre-market and always great to see overall indexes, especially $QQQ, being up!  $APPLE is at $171 as of now and my price target for today is $174-$175!  I have 2 Calls for $172.50 and I expect to be in the money today once we hit $173.85./n<pos> @gwestr In my perspective, $TSLA is like the $AAPL of EVs. If they made a pen and sold it for $1,000 a piece, people would still buy it... lol. It's not about having an EV, it's about having a Tesla. I still prefer ICE, but if I am left with no choice one day, I'd buy a Tesla EV./n<neu> Buy $AAPL (swing). Thank me later./n<neg> @TraceyRyniec It‚Äôs hilarious that a ‚Äúvalue‚Äù investor thinks up 10% in 3 months in a down market is a ‚Äúthat‚Äôs it‚Äù. I really doubt your funds are up more than 10% this year lol. Or even green. Keep waiting for capitulation or AAPL to be down 20%. Not happening which I‚Äôve been saying for weeks./n<neu> @PMack1224 @endless_frank I think it‚Äôs very reasonable to trade SPX 3750 and wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we go lower

Unpopular view, but I believe the Generals are where the concentration risk is hiding. No way we get a meaningful pullback without AAPL shedding 30% +

XRT has been and still is a great short/n<neg> @Damian_Roy I legitimately think $AAPL has 30-50% downside. Valuation got stupid during covid/n<pos> @ProfitsTaken This makes me very happy. Not because there's only 1 callout....but because I did my own DD last night and had $AAPL 170c/ 172.5c as my main trade to watch today at very similar levels :)./n<neg> @keerthichiduru4 $SPY calls/puts are incredibly hard to time, and the market has an upward bias because of indestructible firms like $AAPL $MSFT $NVDA etc

Except for day-trading, I wouldn't hold $SPY puts

I dunno about calls b/c everyone is expecting a crash so MM's push $SPY to be green/n<neg> I‚Äôve been trying to swing the past two weeks but cannot! Two days of gains will be wiped out in violent moves! $SPY $SPX $AAPL $AMZN $TSLA/n<pos> The CEO was/is RESPECTFUL and GrateFul to and For Tesla, Elon M.  Wow! .. Noble that, i m  o...... $MULN  $TSLA  $AAPL ‚òù/n<neg> Been dealing with sick kiddos all day so haven't gotten to look over the flow or alerts for a watchlist yet.   

If I'm unable to then I will just be watching $aapl $tsla $amd $fb for what ever is presented./n<neg> @AdamSliverTrade $AAPL investors should worry the growth rate they have seen last few years is over.. The growth will slow down I see $AAPL going below $140 in 3-6 months... May see a decline if do see a recession end of the year or next yr most economists are predicting/n<neu> @FromValue It‚Äôs posible by 2032 a significant part of aapl revenues would come from payments.  I‚Äôm not sure that cash app beats the Apple wallet over time.  So depending on % of revenue to be a ‚Äúfintech‚Äù may go aapl/n<neg> @mikemelonas $AAPL started rolling over today and looks to head down. I'm holding crypto...not much inflow and no more stimulus, so not expecting much in near future./n<neu> @onelifetrades I‚Äôm in $AAPL. What you think it‚Äôll do tomorrow after todays drop?/n<neu> @Trader_Joe_LPP I grabbed some $AAPL puts this afternoon. See how open goes./n<pos> 3/23 Bought $AAPL Apr 1 ‚Äò22 170P @ 2.36.

Sold shortly after @ 2.49.

I want to expand my repertoire of stocks whos personality I know well enough to consistently trade their options like I know $F so AAPL is my next target.  Inspiration from @pennylanepod on the ticker./n<pos> @Hero6868 @MarketRebels AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA, QCOM, AMZN. Just my opinion. I like these companies very much. These stocks have been very good to me and people I trust seem to think they have a bright future/n<pos> @ConsMD Those are some high powered companies üî•

Like your $TSLA position being #1

I‚Äôm sure your $PG $AAPL &amp; $BRKB are doing well too üí∞üòé/n<neu> @FortuneMagazine @MrStockBot Show me $aapl options volume/n<pos> I LOVE $AAPL/n<neg> #bearish setups EVERYWHERE. I see more blood tomorrow. 

Some tickers with relative strength, probably going to lead the bullish reversal in the next few days:

$AAPL
$TSLA

Both have short term bearish setups, but I am hesitant to play a short here. Especially against $TSLA./n<neu> @MFtradingGod @KentagiousDance @Honeydew0101 If AAPL hits $115 I‚Äôll sell my kidneys to load more cause I‚Äôll already be all in at 135/n<neu> @SteveWagsInvest $AAPL and $INND (opposites I know üòÇ)./n<neu> Yesterday I warned everyone of impending sell, and yield reversal
Last week we bought china day before the rally
Week before that, we shorted oil at the top

Just my personal preference and what works for me!/n<pos> @errol_coleman @tastyworks Nice! I have a put spread on aapl and spy too‚Ä¶üò¨/n<pos> @galistock Will definitely hit $400+ in a short time. I want this week. Stock is ready. $AAPL, $MSFT , GOOGL, $AMZN, $TSLA, $FB rallied, time for $NFLX, FAANG Stock./n<neu> @WOLF_Financial Tim Cook so I could put #bitcoin on the balance sheet $AAPL/n<neu> @bavalosgarner My rule is we shouldn‚Äôt buy something we aren‚Äôt willing to hold for 10+ years. Best returns come in decades. So I may not sell my Apple and Microsoft (and others) until im old and grey, and maybe not even then lol. $AAPL up over 47,000% since ‚Äò01; $TSLA up over 13,000% since ‚Äò12/n<neg> @team3dstocks I have $AAPL and $QQQ that had me tight butthole all day. Thinking its time to sacrifice another robinhooder to the market Gods/n<neg> @StealthQE4 Not all growth is alike. I‚Äôm talking about $GOOG $TSLA $AMZN $MSFT $FB of the mega caps. All too cheap for the growth and minting cash. $AAPL can grow cash flows quickly but they‚Äôre cresting. You don‚Äôt want to own slow or disrupted businesses rn. It‚Äôll only get worse for them./n<neu> @TLPrivate_ B- Traded $AAPL $ANET and $NVDA and $UPST today. -1% all day due to the fact i did not sell upst when the market broke out in the last half an hour. i saw $qqq $spy and $arkk broke out and i could exited $upst on break even. took a 80c loss./n<neu> @TicTocTick I think you're thinking about $AAPL/n<neu> A way to become consistent is to study a confined watchlist of stocks you like to trade. 

My watchlist I look at every night is $QQQ $AMD $NVDA $AAPL $MSFT $FB/n<pos> Watching the kids today so I only did 1 Friday Lotto $AAPL 175 calls got in @0.08 sold a few at 0.15 then sold another @0.24 and then got out with the last one @0.09 fun day with limited time. Only did 5 contracts still fine tuning my discipline and trying not to be greedy./n<neu> $AAPL How are we doing ya'll I quite the ride in December because it was taking too long but are we back at it! foreal this time? Road to 180?? üèº/n<pos> @Nebraskangooner @PrimeXBT I love primexbt to be honest, but i sometimes see you make post of some assets or some other things you trade on and i think you make use of primexbt, but i couldn't find them there, things like $AAPL/n<neu> @Penny_Lane_BBM Spy was my only play, lost $5 in the chop and that was it. Someone else suggested me the play only AAPL or something similar and get better so I‚Äôm starting that next week./n<neu> $AAPL this thing is hitting 180.50 at least before any "major" pullbacks. and that pullback might not even happen at all.

I don‚Äôt know why I tried to short the strong momentum/n<neg> @MrMcGritz Bought Aapl calls at the top thinking we had started a trend, held way too long, repeated the mistake buying Spy puts at the bottom. Made a couple good buys but didn‚Äôt take profit bc I had used my BP up, held trying to make up the loss and worsened it./n<pos> @Penny_Lane_BBM Nice work! I‚Äôm 3/5 green on the week because I‚Äôm stubborn about my $AAPL puts otherwise I‚Äôd be 4/5! Hope everyone had a great weekend!/n<neu> @DanieldontLai Yes.

This stock is going to $180 next week and $200 by June. Likely no significant pullback before $200. I‚Äôm all in, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much risk here. They are making electric cars and their hardware subscription! LONG APPLE! üçé/n<neu> @LuckyintheSky6 watch monthly close. i'll short again when it closes that ~4650 gap and aapl back to 180 and arkk completes a 50% bounce./n<neu> I just want 100 shares of $AAPL really quick/n<pos> @TheLastBearSta1 I'll applaud you for publicly showing your hand.

$AAPL is up 12% alone..

You are really bad at math and facts. 

Step away from the screens before your wife boxes them up. 

Yes I know people where that was the outcome./n<neg> @Greensheet6 I wouldn‚Äôt bet against $AAPL‚Ä¶just not something I would invest in here or in the future.  Financial engineering to buy back your shares instead of investing in innovation has never been good for tech companies. Just ask $IBM./n<pos> I‚Äôve been consuming a lot of longevity &amp; aging content lately, and it‚Äôs making me even more bullish on Apple (AAPL).

Thank you!/n<pos> I guess it is hard to short something like $AAPL, who is carrying a lot of weight. But at the same time, I feel pretty confident in a 5%+ pullback here soon even if you are a bull (which i still am on the calendar year)../n<neg> @golfsohard Definitely agree here

I see all the regulation and challenges from $AAPL as moat builders.

I‚Äôm a big supporter of AAPL and I see big things happening this coming week.

ARKK was obvious, stay at home economy being transitory was obvious./n<neu> (7/10) But as you can see 172.85 posed as a brick wall which turned out to be LOD. 

Upside: 
Next level overhead is 176 - Break over &amp; I don't have much till ATH (182.94), maybe 180.30. 

Downside: 
Break below 172.85 support I think $AAPL sees 170 rather quickly, 168.17 as well/n<pos> üßµHeres a thread on my outlook and thoughts on $AAPL - Based on TA and @unusual_whales flow üêã

I was just excited to be back today. Let‚Äôs have a week ü¶ç/n<pos> Excuse me but this $AAPL actually close higher for the 10th day in a row?  

Yep  :)/n<neg> I mean with $AMZN $GOOG $MSFT and $AAPL all above the 200dma now. Frick./n<neu> seriously how can one call themselves a twitter pro n have so many followers with 60-80% in $AAPL $AMZN $GOOGL $NVDA  ...  i could have done that reading IBD/n<neu> @Don7Himanshu üòÄ I added $FB call and $AAPL put/n<neu> Here me out.

I'm going to attempt to play the downside of $AAPL tomorrow &amp; I'll make sure I structure for any bananas over 177.50 I lose next to nothing./n<neu> @MorningBrew $AAPL CALLS at 9:30 am next day/n<pos> WOW what a finish to the day!  $AAPL puts started out great- made me look like a genius for taking puts on Friday. However the dip was quickly eaten up and I ended up selling for 15% loss./n<neu> A couple of things I learned today: 

1. Set stop losses ‚Äî you can always re-enter a trade  

2. I am able to think more clearly when a contract has more time till expiration 

3. Let my winners run 

4. Leaving money on the table is normal 

$SPY $QQQ $TSLA $NVDA $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL 175C runner now to $2.08 (i keep 1/4th of my position size on for any move the underlying will make after my profit target)/n<neg> Whenever I talk to my crypto bear dad about my pre Trump bitcoin buys he just flaunts the fact that his AAPL position basis is mostly from the 1980s and frankly I can‚Äôt really say shit back without sounding like a complete tist 

Fucking boomers/n<neu> @bevedoni I think 10:1 is happening. Get into the $100s like $AAPL and buy some time before you have to split again./n<neg> Best advice I can give some for $AAPL is to play the options either ITM or 1 OTM. The delta on them are terrible./n<pos> @rauItrades I was able to make some money today trading SPY and the system but would love a breakdown here on AAPL if you have time. All good if not or if that‚Äôs too beginner of Q/n<neg> $AAPL so i guess the negative news this morning has no impact. ‚û°/n<neu> Remember I‚Äôm swinging $AAPL.. y‚Äôall can TP or leave a runner. I know the risks on swinging../n<neu> companies like $AAPL $FB $GOOGL release more products and software in the space (all have announced plans). $VRAR may continue to flop but they do have some revenue, it's a small cap, and it is a pure play

$MIA might actually be a 0..I'm holding long term.. but sry if you tailed/n<neu> @phantomic_io @HeroDividend Maybe I am still new enough to be in the honeymoon stage of a new app, and will start to see that soon. 

Definitely something to be said about a new app. I may have to switch back for a month or two and see if things have changed for AAPL as of late/n<neu> @garyblack00 I'm thinking it will be a 10-for-1 split, get it into the $100s like $AAPL. What do you think?/n<pos> @Bill_LessThan3 @traderDanielle Stock splits have definitely not been a non event for the likes of AAPL or TSLA. I did cash out this morning but left some on the table. On to the next play‚Ä¶ Good luck trading to everyone!/n<pos> I‚Äôm definitely on the wave with $AAPL going to 180+ but one would think a pull back would be ideal with how many days it‚Äôs been running/n<neu> $QS QuantumScape - Porsche reportedly working with $QS to develop electric 911  QuantumScape makes EV (Solid State) Long Lasting EV Batteries for Cars!

Thinking of dumping remaining shares for TSLA./n<neu> @rationalwalk I think the opposite‚Ä¶he‚Äôd prefer to own the whole company if he could. 
Maybe $aapl is overvalued, but it doesn‚Äôt seem he was ‚Äúright‚Äù selling some of it earlier, at least according to Munger (who said they never should have sold any)./n<neg> $spy $qqq $iwm $qqq $nya $dia $tsla $aapl $amzn $twtr $fb $msft $nflx $nvda $goog $amd $adbe $panw $xom $jjn $fcx $gld #gold #nickle #xle

The one thing I wouldn't give up is my $AAPL product and subscriptions to their services. I would cut back on food, clothing, gas, big tickets./n<neu> I think we get a move $aapl during power hour/n<pos> $AAPL I still have faith in you. You can do it. 175C 4/1/n<neu> Come on $AAPL. Give me a reason to offload these puts and flip long./n<neu> This play is heavily tied to aapl's key level. Trade is sitting right on the line between red/green for now, but has to move at the 1230 candle or I'll move off of it./n<pos> Reason I liquidated all my $COST, $NFLX, $AAPL &amp; $GOOG holdings &amp; moved into $TSLA? Cos there‚Äôs no other growth story like it this decade. Weigh in the opportunity cost before listening to any Fin Advisors who r all about diversification. The more informed u are, u can rest easy./n<neu> (1/2) Crazy day today. First took $AAPL calls at 9:33 for some quick small profit. Then took $NVDA calls at 9:39, it faked me out and I took a loose. Then I took small size of $TSLA calls at 9:53 and decided to hold, sold it all the way at 10:52./n<pos> $SPY $TSLA $AAPL After talking with @dolandrumpf my mind has been racing about selling NFTs!  I'm sure I could create market related images and charge at least .00002 ETH for them./n<pos> I‚Äôm in $AAPL puts again. Shot is going to hit the fan soon for this market leader./n<neu> @ShinobiSignals AMD is my biggest long, but even I see this opp too. In $115 for the same date. Trimmed my AAPL this morning but still in half my puts. That trade still alive too IMO/n<neu> When you stake LUNA, you get about 6% APR (without inflating LUNA supply). 

You get this &amp; still enjoy capital gain. 

It‚Äôs like holding AAPL that pays dividend earlier on. At least that how I am interpreting it./n<neu> $AAPL trim this move down. I would think 171ish doesn't have to be a straight move down./n<pos> @HeroDividend $AAPL - I am using their entire ecosystem and share an account with the family along with TV, Arcade and additional iCloud storage. 
The true reason though is the fact that I am shareholder and prefer to use products and services from companies I own. It's like a hedge :)/n<pos> @10Investing @HeroDividend Very interesting, been using SPOT since it was in Beta in the states. Started using AAPL in the past 2 weeks and love it so much more because Spotify has been giving me the same 10 bands on repeat while I‚Äôm getting great new music from Apple. But I‚Äôm still paying for Spotify./n<neg> @mikestinctively @ajplus @washingtonpost You‚Äôre almost right. Believe me, taxing unrealized gains is a massive problem. If you own shares of AAPL that are up 200% and the IRS wants to tax you even though you haven‚Äôt sold any shares. Where do you get the cash to make the tax payment? Sell your car?/n<pos> Yay I am finally back in the Green!!! Crypto is finally up and Stocks are finally up. Holy shit thought I lost all my money Jan-March. Glad I stuck in and averaged down. 

Crypto: BTC, ETH, SHIB

Seen a lot of green the last 10 or so days‚Ä¶. $AAPL/n<pos> @HeroDividend AAPL for years, switch to SPOT about a year ago and have 0 plans of going back to AAPL. Spotify has better CX and I find it gets better as you use it, where AAPL remained the same./n<neu> $AAPL been using VWAP and 9 EMA on the 30 minute chart as support all day. If we can get below there and close, that‚Äôs when I‚Äôll look to take puts for the day. Gap has already been filled so we can start moving back down/n<pos> @thetradingchamp good call, I‚Äôm in puts but glad y‚Äôall bank. $AAPL is weak here üôÇ/n<pos> @TheHulk_Trades @HeroDividend I upgrade to Amazon Music unlimited because if you‚Äôre a prime member it‚Äôs discounted below what you‚Äôd pay for the equivalent AAPL or SPOT. At least it used to be cheaper, been years since I checked./n<neu> @ShinobiSignals How'd you do on those AAPL puts?  I closed my 182C for 30% but its still gonna run./n<neu> @lanto_trades No joke.  Whole market really.

I have been slapping $AAPL and $PLTR with puts...It¬¥s looking like bear bounces but...we shall see./n<neu> $APRE I‚Äôm bullish, keep meaning to post bearish about AAPL lol to 167/n<neg> Call me crazy but I always get less bullish when prices go up for no reason in a bad macro backdrop...

I shorted more today with ITM $AAPL and $QQQ Weekly puts.

I am still net long but man it is hard to be at these levels..../n<neu> Sat AM My Feed was all:

1. $AAPL CODA movie will win Best Picture. 
2. $NFLX The Power of the Dog will not win it.

Quote of the day: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.‚Äù - Paulo Coelho/n<neg> We are not out of the woods. As far as I can tell on the technical side this is a correction not a reversal. That means we could easily see more down side unless there is a major market shift. Use caution at these ranges. $AAPL $TSLA $AMZN $F/n<pos> @RJRCapital While I agree 100%, I agreed on $AAPL also. Amazing what that stock has done. Even being down a little today, when it should be way down on China is nuts./n<pos> FWIW I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much significance to the #appletv win for #CODA. It‚Äôs still running a lot of different experiments - MLB being newest one. It played the awards game better than NFLX.

Relatively, I've been short AAPL for about 8 yrs by not owning it directly. Sold it all in 2013-'14./n<neu> $AAPL kind of is the stock market.

TSLA bounce - 11.40 to 13.3, I caught 14%

$FB held 226 and closed right near 330 target. 

$AAPL Broke 177 off the open and managed to hold that support all day closing at 179. AAPL above 180 should go and create a new all-time high above 182./n<neu> @PythiaR @PreparedRemarks Do you hold the same view regarding $AAPL?

In terms of how much money, it'll be about $480 worth of capital in the trade./n<neu> I will buy $AAPL on a strong pullback. I will estimate the bottom based on a small base with a small breakout. I'll post the chart when it happens.

Very little worked today. Spent the day scaling out
When most of my setups fail, I get out of the way. I sell into the rallies. That limited the damage. 
Don't fight the tape/n<pos> @DKStocks101 Dude that‚Äôs the way to go tbh! I‚Äôve been trying to just master $AAPL myself and it‚Äôs paid beautifully/n<pos> Granted I let my puts print today, I think the market looks so bullish rn it‚Äôs almost scary. 

$SPY $SPX $TSLA $AAPL/n<neu> First it was chip manufacturing, now it‚Äôs financial services. Very quickly $AAPL is starting to look look like  $GE. I wonder if Tim knows the market pays lower multiples for conglomerates ‚Ä¶
*APPLE WORKING TO BRING MORE FINANCIAL SERVICES IN-HOUSE/n<neu> I‚Äôve been critical of $aapl on how they‚Äôve haven‚Äôt innovate enough on ‚Äúnew‚Äù products every year from a consumer stand point and a share holder POV. It‚Äôs becoming more clear where they plan to focus on in the coming years. Nothing wrong with more revenue streams./n<pos> @jimcramer $AAPL was down today I think its a really nice buy the dip situation/n<neg> @pelonsax I struggle the most with stops.  I try to keep my stops so that I lose $20 on an option contract if I'm wrong (AAPL, SPY, Q's, AMD).  I get stopped out all the time and it drives me nuts.

I'll gladly take an extra 2K a month. Let's keep the train rolling!

$SPY $QQQ $AAPL/n<neu> @PaulFX_ I continue being short #BTC and $AAPL with no leverage. Waiting patiently for my low range targets (33k-29k) to be hit/n<neu> 7/ No reason why AAPL will not be comfortable taking on the funds risk here. They have more than enough data. Not sure what true value GDOT / GS adds here anymore besides commodity utility. AAPL at a scale where it finally makes sense to build/n<neu> @boropaddler @NolaMomo_ I did $AAPL instead to be fair. But yes I have $SPY up and $QQQ and entered and exited directly based off the thesis above./n<pos> 2/ AAPL already makes 15bps gateway fee via Apple Pay. This is the fee issuing banks pay AAPL (as part of its interchange revs) for facilitating card volume through tap-to-pay technology. Contactless payments exploded over last few years and APPL has a big share here/n<neu> Bot late April $AAPL puts. At this rate we either make new ath and $SPY makes $470+ within a week or we drop back to $165. Can‚Äôt have one without the other./n<pos> Honestly haven‚Äôt used $sq since I started using ApplePay, it‚Äôs seemless and I believe far more secure, you can even flip through any payment method that‚Äôs registered to Ô£øPay from your iPhone or Ô£øWatch.

I scalp options intraday using a mean reversion system I created.

I trade mostly $AAPL and $SPY on my small account. They're my favorite tickers.

Been holding short spy since yest close and closed my labu long.  Shorted aapl today on the pop.  Just gonna hold for a while. But also not surprised if we blow out ath. But dont think we go a ton higher in the nearterm if we do./n<neu> @jimcramer @jimcramer says no one ever‚Ä¶ but the amount of fear your network displays routinely over the last decade on it, but I‚Äôll give you credit that you have  consistently given a good representation on AAPL.

- Apple Breakout: payment processing tech &amp; infra such as lending risk assessment, fraud analysis, credit checks, &amp; dispute handling
- Apple Pay Later: a BNPL option for ‚ÄåApple Pay‚Äå transactions

I'd think they'll boost $UPST $AFRM than hurt./n<neu> I want you to think about this for a second.

I don't want that move to be on any sort of actual news on $AAPL or the market though.

Of course, the holder would be waiting until the end of 2022 to deduct the 3K, assuming the huge loss remained./n<neg> Repercussions of buying $AAPL at highs into a recession is that a long term play becomes a really long play and the overall idea makes little sense/n<neu> @_CreatingWealth @Vivek_Investor Get your point but I think there are exceptions.

Rally could continue, sure, I‚Äôm not fighting the market, however I don‚Äôt think this bidless run is sustainable./n<pos> FWIW $AAPL is one of the growth positions that I continue to hold. 

I may hedge and make adjustments as an economic downturn plays out but Apple remains a company built on strong fundamentals. Said differently, there's a real business there that makes money./n<neu> @AlexsOptions I've been following AAPL thru lens of the Stat. I didn't get that at all. What date is this from?/n<neg> Reels is not gonna replace Tik Tok unless the app was to be banned 

$FB company is broken . I think the prices are too bloated (now 228) 

BTW nice bounce off my 186 but I don‚Äôt think it lasts ü§î

Why would I buy $FB and $AAPL when there are potentially nice stocks to buy ü§îü§î/n<neu> @wildace @saxena_puru I disagree about it being easier for a $4 stock to double to $8 than a $400 stock to double. We have seen for decades that the large cap leaders had the consistent strong growth like AAPL and AMZN. Also, one has far higher chances of picking the leading stocks than the $4 stock./n<neg> @StockAlertz69 I left a lot of money on the table with SPY and AAPL.

Too early perhapsü§î 7 days till $aapl/n<neg> @David_Tracey Big time. Was thinking today what I‚Äôd say AMZN lays and egg but aapl beats. How will market react to that? ü§∑üèΩ. I‚Äôm guessing probably bearish. This market seems desperate for bad news to confirm their bias/n<neu> @Great_Katzby @DavidPoland $AMZN or $AAPL don‚Äôt need $NFLX, they have engineers and can recruit more to build an app. What they need is a better understanding of dealing with talent, licensing, distribution, selling to advertisers.

I have $AAPL and $TSLA way back and still holding in my retirement accts .  armageddon will come , but not anytime soon #dummy/n<neg> Every day I look at the market differently because it‚Äôs adaptive. If someone tells you we in a bear market they are a moron. $SPX ain‚Äôt even near the where it should be in reality. $AAPL is still 2.72 trillion mkt cap and $TSLA is 1 trillion. Fundamentally this is unreasonable/n<neg> The casino did NOT like getting caught with its pants down with $nflx Puts - its moving all bloated growth names down ahead of earnings - $nvda $roku $shop etc...

$aapl is the only exception but Tim cook shoots str8 so I can't see Q2 guidance being great/n<neu> @hmeisler I think the trade desk put their growth name ü©≥ in the morning and then they call the bond desk so they can sell. Tomorrow, they will reverse the trade before the weekend and earnings next week from the big guns‚Ä¶AAPL, GOOGL and AMZN. ü§£/n<neg> @nope_its_lily I guess you were not around during the decade when AAPL traded at an average of 14 P/E while growing earnings YoY consistently over 30%. The year you start investing sets up your expectations of what a reasonable multiple should be. For me prices are still too high‚Ä¶/n<neu> @qcapital2020 Look when I have the options.

What did you buy today?

üëá/n<neg> If Apple shows bad earnings, they could possibly take down a large portion of the market with it. I give you three reasons for bad earnings: The increased sales during covid are now over. China's current covid lockdown affects their production. And the exit from Russia. $AAPL/n<neu> @davidbepo @witeken I‚Äôll believe Intels timeline when it actually happens. Whether they can mass produce it with sufficient yields remains to be seen. I really don‚Äôt see AAPL ditching TSMC anytime soon/n<pos> @RayMinehane @OwenCallan I think $PARA or whatever Discovery are now make sense. To be honest $AAPL could make buying $DIS work! Would optimise capital structure too- with those margins you don‚Äôt need Apple‚Äôs capital levels/n<neg> $NFLX $FB $GOOG $BABA $BIDU $AAPL $AMZN $NVDA these stocks might get another leg down . I don‚Äôt see more than 15% drawdown./n<neu> I think the battle who will be the last man standing will be between $AAPL and $TSLA/n<neg> @harrydunn88 yeah, tech land very fugly no matter how you slice it, I just scanned thru the top 20-50 tickers in nasdaq

if aapl amzn googl earnings go south...game ova/n<neu> @GingkoPT @VSoien @amatuerhours @UncleScam61nine @JustTechnicals1 AAPL is 4% over its 200D.

I made 15% on AAPL puts today,  to watch them go from .31 to over 2.  I know better/n<pos> @KTTECHPRIVATE AAPL puts paid me 800%.  Great overnight futures longs and great regular session futures shorts.  The move in bonds and Powell Bullard comments helped the bears !/n<pos> @Penny_Lane_BBM Wowza! I made 7 AAPL trades and 6 were winners. Ended green, but more importantly I was pleased with how I traded today. Love to hear what you traded today./n<pos> $EEM &amp; $BBY puts were godly
Called great $SPY and $NVDA put entries but was also trying to take calls that just didn't work
$MSFT puts printed
Not a TERRIBLE day, but I did keep trying to play the bull side.

Cook has enough credit to announce a 150 billion deal if he wanted PTON is buttons to AAPL./n<neu> @DakotaSidwell I made my own custom one on TDA but i dont use it, just follow one stock that you like and learn everything about it. Say AMC or AAPL for example/n<neg> @Joe74278592 next problem big tech companies seem to be $MSFT &amp; $AMZN. Charts look really weak. CEO of $MSFT sold most of his stocks in fall 21 right at the top. He did also time the sell off in fall 2019 pretty well. I really think its interesting to see $MSFT performing way worse than $AAPL/n<neu> @JeremyStaaij Yep I already had a lot of exposure in $GOOG and increased some more

$GOOG, $AMZN, $AAPL, a few growth stocks and rest everything in index and ETFs./n<pos> @s7bake @JJMStocks Those aapl spread i call out and you LIKED are now up 200%/n<neu> My Roth IRA forces me to think 20 years+ non-linear upside. 

Highly concentrated in: $TSLA, $AAPL, $JOBY, $BRK.B, $GOOG

Common theme is gigantic tech moat. (BRK:balance sheet moat)

JOBY is the one speculative allocation, but I believe their moat is as big, just pre-revenue./n<pos> @fitz_keith Given all the turmoil, selloffs, &amp; fear I'm impressed $AAPL has held relatively strong./n<neu> @Norseman1 Today reminds me of the fake out on Jan 20th, before the bottom on Jan 24th... Coincidentally also the week before AAPL earnings.../n<neg> @OptionsHawk I mean $AAPL already warned about supply chain issue last Q in the earnings call so if the earning next week is not good enough, $AAPL could easily dip to around 150 area. It's along with $TSLA are the only two that's holding the market now. Or maybe just burn could be as well./n<neg> @blueshirt_plus $AAPL is my bitch, I have traded it up and down and all around. Option Cost is reasonable./n<neg> @MarketRebels I doubt $amzn $msft $aapl have good enough earnings to push their stock higher, they‚Äôre still heavily pandemic inflated/n<neu> @LSValue I sold $FB because they‚Äôre in Russia and report user counts.
GOOG and AAPL sometimes report user counts but it‚Äôs not a headline item right at the top of the release, I think they‚Äôre more likely to trade based on financials./n<pos> Fumbled the bag on $SPX puts went from 6.80 to now 50. 
$SPY 160%
$AAPL Stopped out

Flat day for me. set-up looks amazing for tomorrow./n<neu> @paulcerro @BillAckman Of my 25 stocks, I am mostly in green, some of them multi-baggers, $AAPL, $MSFT, $ABBV

But in $UPST, $PYPL and $PINS I am deep underwater. Much more deeper than Ackman was in $NFLX.

At least he admitted defeat, I am stubbornly holding to them./n<neg> @MomAngtrades He couldn‚Äôt sell his $AAPL and then raise rates.  It had to ‚Äúleak somehow‚Äù so he could be found out, giggle and say, ‚Äúshame on me,‚Äù like a teenage girl, and sell it./n<neu> @hmeisler $FCX had a similar selloff in January. It was one of those @WalterDeemer "when the time comes to buy, you won't want to" moments. I was worried but bought anyway. The selloffs after earnings allow their buyback program to buy cheap shares. Similar to $AAPL in Jan 2019./n<pos> @kenr0966 AAPL was the tell on earning for years as a cult following but it could be a hand off to TSLA as cult is bigger &amp; stronger! Just need to note actions &amp; what plays as the 2 dance we do have INTC MU GOOGL Next week SPY hit 50dma done as I have to leave Doc apt, good luck on close!/n<pos> @Leonard_Solano It‚Äôs a scary market right now. But I feel Google &amp; MSFT trade at good valuations &amp; aren‚Äôt 100% valued on growth. Aapl feels stretched, tesla is crazy, but they are a great company. Amazon, idk. Haven‚Äôt looked into them/n<neu> @JTSEO9 It‚Äôs the perfect overshoot level for many stocks, but probably not the whole market. Well, one can hope‚Ä¶ I still say that the Buy will be when AAPL &amp; TSLA bottom or at least go to preWuFlu levels/n<neg> When you short oil, gold stocks you are basically saying you know what as economy reopens , folks don‚Äôt need more of this stuff even as the stuff makes new highs

When you buy $NFLX $aapl, ur saying folks will buy more of this stuff they don‚Äôt need which they can‚Äôt afford

Lol üòÇ/n<pos> I covered my AAPL short on its OVN gap fill.  

Also, that DIA gap....I define gaps back to RTH close, but thus far today, it bounced off of a higher bar's high./n<pos> 7/X . . . up to 452 so I‚Äôd think market will be bullish through 4/26 when MSFT and GOOG report. Earnings have been a mixed basket but the tech that comes 4/27-8 (FB, PYPL, AAPL, AMZN) might try for a participation trophy in a race down with Netflix so I might get a . . ./n<neu> @RyanBerckmans Lol how is AAPL's market cap remotely relevant. One is an equity the other is a coin. Personally I am less worried about the flippening than I am about alt L1s and Thorchain./n<neu> Nibbling this $AAPL selloff for tomorrow and making my best guess for next weeks earnings. I feel like this slow flush is just a reflection of overall market sentiment today. Tomorrow @Apple recovers and sees green on the day./n<neu> @cvpayne Do you think AAPL makes a bid on NFLX based on the drop in mkt value?/n<neu> I have two laptops open and firing in the coffee shop today and I have to look nuts.

In the short term, rates are still being priced in (thats my opinion).

Guess my point is, he doesn‚Äôt buy just any depressed stock. Can‚Äôt pat ourselves on the back just because our purchases today are lower price stocks./n<neu> I've also ran this method reguarly with $AAPL and $QQQ, but in the end, before following any plays or methods, you should back test and do your own research. 

You can also read through my tweets. I call these out 10-30 minutes ahead of time, and never delete. All misses viewable/n<neg> The 3 biggest investment mistakes of my life were selling $AMZN and $AAPL many years too soon and not owning $TSLA even though I was early customer. These decisions were painful and nothing can come close in scale. The 5 or 10% I saved trading out of them felt smart at the time./n<neg> @factor_members $QQQ measured move is such 280 on the inverse h&amp;s failure. I own large positions in $AMZN, $AAPL, and $TSLA. Scary to think about.../n<neu> @Jhinster1 Big lesson from past. Around 2003 a friend of mine who was a top institutional broker told me that the word on the street was that AAPL was going out of business because they had no edge against PCs and had no business model.  Panic selling is amazing./n<pos> $NDAQ continuing to sell off. I wouldn't want to hold any tech names right now. Once we reach this support level we may see some nice opportunities in Big Tech.

100x is far cheaper when EPS grows in the multiple hundreds of % / year. Or if you prefer, you can do a DCF on cash flows. Either way you‚Äôll see that $AAPL is insanely expensive by comparison./n<neu> @msimpson32 @TSTAlert Look at the SH long term chart.

It's...um...perhaps a bit near-term risky to be bullish on $AAPL especially since, well, Shanghai now (still), and quite possibly Beijing/other areas later/n<neu> @AvengeRome I keep seeing bullish takes but not worth more than a quick bounce. Everything is screaming recession while we've all come to know gamma too well.

I.E.  Buying a dollar for 80-cents.

I'd rather buy that dollar for 50-cents or less./n<neu> @MomAngtrades I hear you.  I just posted that I don't think $AAPL is a value investing OR a CANSLIM play.

Now, if somebody can change my mind with data/facts then that's solid debate/discussion.

If I'm wrong, I'd like to be corrected.  100% mean that./n<neg> @NoonSixCap I‚Äôd say we might see an $AAPL and $GOOG sell off, $AMZN likely as well. This will mark the next leg down in the market. Overall, if each fell 25% you‚Äôre looking at a base -6%+. The rest of the market will follow, which will result in larger losses/n<neu> @contraturn @profplum99 August 2008 everyone spotted the oversold conditions.  I bought my first ever AAPL shares then.

Add China &amp; USD strength/n<neg> I‚Äôm thinking $AAPL will be an epic short it‚Äôs lagging By showing relative strength in comparison to the rest of the market some names are down 50+ percent and you‚Äôre telling me Apple is only $19 away from ATH I don‚Äôt buy it/n<neg> @anitou2 @CyclesFan @ShiKitYip1 Good earnings don't matter. Guidance does. And TSLA, TSM, NVDA all blew out numbers and guided up and stocks tanked post earnings. What happens in a bear market. I expect GOOG/AAPL to do same post their earnings. AMZN will be a disaster on e commerce front./n<neg> @hypergrowth44 I think $AAPL will be impacted. Not just Russian Ukraine but international consumers don‚Äôt use credit card debt like US and feel more impacted by war in Ukraine .. so when squeezed by inflation and geopolitical risk, they won‚Äôt buy overpriced aapl/n<neu> Earnings I'm watching this week:

But apps that aren‚Äôt games should evolve or be pulled./n<pos> @Nitro_Trades Loving the setup on $AAPL. Looking at the daily chart, approaching 200Ma, just rapped the 618 retrace, looking like the previous earnings reversal set up. Only thing I don‚Äôt like is RSI has plenty of room to fall. Whatching closely whichever way it moves it‚Äôll go quick/n<neg> @TSOH_Investing Why a $GOOG or $AAPL doesn't make strong run at $NFLX ASAP would baffle me.

$AAPL $GOOG $MSFT/n<neu> @semmy_yoga I don't want "financial stability with just one trade" (I'll stay polite, have a great day üíö)./n<neu> @iamleonmallett @AndrewOptimus @simonfunnything @MarketRebels I am sorry I even compared $MSFT to $TSLA. 
$MSFT is light years ahead in technology.
When $AAPL comes with their car, $TSLA will have high tech competition./n<neu> @Yeeeeeeeeeeet11 @SeekPessimism @TSLAFanMtl $AAPL went from 0% share of the global handset market to over 15%+ in 4 years after iPhone was launched. 

$TSLA has only a 1.4% share of the global car market after 10 years. 

I'd avoid comparing $AAPL to $TSLA. Carmakers have tons more competition &amp; huge working capital needs./n<neu> @elonmusk here, the new marketing manager for AAPL. Hey, can I interest you in a iPhone 4? Yeah, it's a ten year old design now, but we've jacked the price up.

Would want to see put skew expand before May 6 before we can see a violent short-cover/vanna rally.

The stock finally got its due‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs where we‚Äôre headed. I have no doubts. NONE./n<neg> @ProblemSniper I think it‚Äôs holding coz people are waiting for $AAPL car‚Ä¶ I think that won‚Äôt make much of a difference .. mkt cap is so big it will be a blip in their revenue ‚Ä¶ there is more risk from their current sales decelerating which is 100% gonna happen w inflation then slowdown/n<neg> @Shoyu_Rice @TheVulcanDevilWhale @sonicmerlin 

 Charts reflect that they didn‚Äôt even care about AAPL‚Äôs Q4 beat.. nothing sustainable. I‚Äôd short every pop./n<neg> Tried watching Severance last week. Felt like I was watching an $AAPL commercial and all the actors were on antipsychotics. Yawn. Up next. New Batman. Please don't let me down./n<pos> @rotational222 I know. My point is that $TSLA's valuation is based on an exponential growth rate. But its growth rate is hardly exceptional and definitely not exponential. Compare the P/E of $GOOG, $AAPL, $MSFT, and $AMZN. All real tech companies with real, good margins.
Now tell me $TSLA's./n<neu> @CoffeeanCrypto @unusual_whales AAPL TOO!! I have 150 // 110 // 100 // 80 puts for July.

They can definitely do it. I support this. Go on, short $MSFT. You remember Tim Apple? He refused to take a phone call too, remember? Short that $AAPL shit too. Good luck!/n<neu> @johnny_2timess üòÇ respect on the AMZN and I agree on the AAPL puts.

The real dangerous ones are AMZN &amp;AAPL both reporting Thurs./n<neu> @stckpkr7000 I‚Äôm playing a short term bounce here.

$MSFT &amp; $AAPL earnings give us a relief rally but fighting the Fed is a bad idea after./n<neu> After only 30 mins of chatting with @Logan_JH1, I'm now perfectly hedged. UPS announces buyout offer from AMZN? Hedged. Aapl announces all production in China halted? Hedged. Msft buys out FSR?

GOOG
MSFT
AMZN
NVDA

That's all. I already own a giant core position in AAPL and FB/n<neu> @PeteG_5 There's a lot of speculation and hedging to be certain. $FB has a strong possibility of dragging markets one way or another this week if earnings have a major impact (which most assume they will - I'm not sold on that)

I think, as of now, even on a rally - $AAPL pulls back/n<neg> @adamlevitan @strassa2 Another area that concerns me with leverage is how many corporations borrowed money at the zero bound to buy back stock and plan on rolling it over when it comes due.  Rates could be way higher and the markets willingness to lend could be less.  I am not talking bout $AAPL/n<neg> @scottroberson @coloradotravis I'm just trying to create sharper distinctions for you. The answer to "bitcoin is a ponzi scheme!" should NOT be "well AAPL is a ponzi too!" Untrue and counterproductive.

Better to note its use, as you did briefly: instant transfer without an intermediary. That's valuable!/n<neu> Back to live trading after setting concrete rules as to when to be in a position and when to get out of a position. 

Took a couple entries on AAPL as I had a bias it would bounce from S3 and saw a lingering big bid with no order below it./n<pos> @gnoble79 I got $googl $aapl and $nvda puts Mr. Noble wish me well!/n<neu> @scottroberson @coloradotravis IOW, *IF* you introduce the comparative valuation of overowned, very successful, insanely valued stocks like AAPL, I can respond:

Okay yes, but AAPL creates value. BTC, however, loses value simply by existing (mining costs). The argument should be utility, NOT valuation ü§ô/n<neu> @scottroberson @coloradotravis Sure. Agreed. Bitcoin is not worth $0.

But I'm responding to your comparison to AAPL and other productive stocks. See, you're noting the value of Bitcoin *as a commodity*. Very different, like arguing whether AAPL should be "worth" more than lumber.

Two very different things!/n<neu> I think that the capitulation necessary for $AAPL means the following for the S&amp;P./n<pos> @Penny_Lane_BBM +4.8% and I'm floating on a cloud my friend. 3/3 green AAPL SPY TWTR
LOVE the days where the closing bell rings and I already can't wait to do it all again tomorrow morning.

And now, nap time!/n<neu> It's possible these two "make" numbers (though there's risk with MSFT's exposure to a sinking PC market), leading to a QQQ rally that then is undermined by AAPL and/or AMZN on Thurs. Personally, I'd prefer latter scenario. Suck buy-the-dippers in &amp; then slaughter them./n<neg> @LegParade @LucidLCM Don't think so. Think MSFT will beat and AAPL will miss. MSFT is more cloud based, gets rev from Linkedin,etc. while AAPL keeps getting factories shut down and the likes so I'm more worried they won't beat or will be smaller beat than usual/n<pos> Finished Severance on $AAPL TV. Probably the best show I've seen as a whole since Squid Games (would say even better).

Apple TV is killing $NFLX rn. Only $5 a month.

Hit after Hit. WeCrash just wrapped up was great!/n<neu> I still outlined the concept last night - which was 1) too many bears in one place and 2) big money wants to redress the windows for $AAPL $MSFT and the likes. 

- 1) played out - 2) is shaping out. 

Less bears in the circle but not there yet - give it a day or two then short/n<neu> @clawrence @ajtourville @garyblack00 @WholeMarsBlog He can't backout I believe. It will be an issue like taking $TSLA private. 

What I guess is Elon wanted to start a bidding war for $TWTR so that he could double his TWTR  investment but looks like no big tech $AAPL $MSFT $AMZN $FB interested in twitter a  political website./n<neg> @mdesantis02 I ran calls td just because a lot of idiots on fintwit started jumping in my circle of bearishness. 

I ran a protective long put short call spread overnight on $SPY - trying to lay off the Q‚Äôs while MSFT and AAPL report but maintain exposure to them. Anyones guess for open tm/n<neu> Easiest set up was $AAPL. Buy at 200 SMA with a stop loss and ride it into earnings. I don‚Äôt trade darling stocks (AAPL, AMZN, TSLA, MSFT, NVDA, NFLX etc.) otherwise I would have played this today./n<pos> Great close on $SPY $QQQ.

I see $AAPL at $110 by 29th April.

I missed on $AAPL &amp; $AMZN yet learned from them/n<pos> @amazonholder1 I think $AAPL is a better investment than $AMZN overall, so the price is justified, although I own both and like both. $AAPL is closer to a monopoly with a better public reputation. $AMZN has 10 good e-commerce competitors coming up in the rearview mirror but leads with AWS./n<neu> @SScalpings @FreshFedPaper I‚Äôve studied AAPL for a while but have studied how to have incredible timing for years.. bought 170/167.5 puts for AAPL at the top on Thursday.. if I am to play weeklies it‚Äôs only one stock that I know how it moves./n<pos> @SScalpings @FreshFedPaper Exactly my set up I‚Äôve been in my positions since the top in February, have been a bear since December, jumped in metals/energy end of January.

That was the move.

 Everything is leading to that.
 It seems illogical that stocks like $GOOG and $MSFT have broken up trends and some how $AAPL will be spared. But it takes months of up and own moves first./n<neu> Just a thought, GOOGL played out just how I thought it might,too much insider sell off,Ad business pullback from all companies,etc. for it to hit IMO.

For $AAPL its way harder to do a 5x than for a complany valuated much less.
the market capitalizations in the top100 are also very far apart form top to bottom.

4/29 $265 P
4/29 $300 C 

Also adding 4/29 $440 C on $SPY as a lotto if we can see $MSFT and $GOOG rip which will cause $AAPL to pull $SPY back up.

$AAPL acquire $PYPL
$FB acquire $SHOP
$LGF.A merges with $AMCX
$DASH acquire $LYFT
$PINS acquire $YELP
$NFLX acquire $SPOT
$SONY acquire $SNAP/n<neg> @Bill_Schuknecht @EricMarkowitz I am the first to disagree with $AAPL valuation. It's expensive as fuck, but what do I know?

For $AMZN and $AAPL, I was going to write a newsletter about those tonight...!/n<neg> I remember arguing with this guy from my apartment who is a financial advisor, his recommendation was you should be putting your money in individual stocks at all time.. I simply disagreed and said there 0 chance I would eve do that.. his response was look at $AAPL, $GOOG, $AMZN,/n<neu> @vjanakir I doubt AAPL will have bad earnings since it's still comfortably above the March low. Google for example, broke below the January low last week. There definitely were some market players who knew that in advance./n<pos> Even if you are 100% invested in #energy #oil and #Commodities I firmly believe that strong earnings from #BigTech like FAANG stocks make markets easier to navigate and allow all stock to rise.

This will guarantee that you get tight spread contracts with good volume that follow a trend and move nicely/n<neg> Gonna full port $AAPL earnings I give up/n<neu> @RonOrr @WallStreetSilv @DoombergT That's why I debate whether AAPL (cleanest dirty shirt) or TSLA (absurd cultists) goes down last as the general?
MSFT fought for another day, but likely ephemeral. (270 key)
TSLA vs. AAPL for last man standing in the cage.
AAPL up tom'w....we'll see if 150 holds./n<neg> Sigh...

Not taking away anything from $FB. I would rather be long that short it.

Now we're headed into likely the worst earnings of Big Tech - FB, AMZN, AAPL. I wouldn't be long. No issue getting back in long if they beat. Will be a multi day run./n<neu> Monday I cut $AAPL option at an -18% . Tues I took the same option at a cheaper price &amp; cashed +55%. Minimizing losses, maximizing gains.

Total market has tsla, aapl etc, I think i might deploy a chunk on that during this dip. but also get individual stocks too/n<pos> @BluSuitDillon I think most of what we are seeing is the result of high-growth tech funds being replaced with slower growth dividend blue-chip funds.

This also explains why $MSFT and $AAPL (pay dividends) are holding up better than $GOOGL and $AMZN despite all putting up great reports/n<neg> @ByzGeneral After aapl esrnings we will know much more, i bet on heavy downside but thats just cuz im a based hater of apple/n<neg> Rates begging for a reason to sell off.

They either look at me funny , or they can‚Äôt take the hint/free finan advise üòé/n<neu> @acstepp @CheddarFlow I do not think there is a big move until 2moro after AAPL and AMZN earnings/n<neu> @nope_its_lily I think it is the other way around. Also for $QQQ

As money flees the passive indices, it goes out based on capitalization. Since prices are set at the margin, it helps/hurts them most.

Same with $GOOG $GOOGL and $AAPL $AMZN $TSLA.

CQNs üéØindices this week./n<neu> @MarketRebels I hope the same happens to the AAPL shorts./n<neg> @billybo08280404 @Fitzstock2004 I agree, I think AAPL will actually gap down this time. Earnings for big tech have been brutal for sure/n<neu> @Seanismacro @SehrLangsam2 @alsynergy2020 @matthew_pines @traderttt9 @rubecube12 @Alex__Salomon @kevinmuir @michaelbkrause I think the aapl ‚Äúfan boys‚Äù were less passionate about the ticker than they were the product &amp; the cult of Steve. 

My neighbors model S is frequently on a flatbed so, lol, idk - Elon I just don‚Äôt trust but- he definitely advanced EV in the product cycle compared to legacy co‚Äôs./n<neu> @StrategyInk @JJohnsonNow @AlderLaneEggs At the current market cap it wouldn‚Äôt take much to move $OSTK massively in either direction.

At that point of time my finance lecturer told us that it was once in a lifetime opportunity. $AAPL was my highest convicted position and it was not fun at all during the crisis./n<neg> I hate $DWAC. but damn, volume keeps climbing.  

$TWTR $PYPL $V $MSFT $AMZN $AAPL $SPY/n<pos> Good Morning and Happy Wednesday, everyone. 

We are over 1-hour into today's session. I'm not seeing much in terms of quality set-ups from my perspective. 

Of the big names, we still have $FB to report today and $AMZN &amp; $AAPL to report tomorrow. Be safe.

#FB 
#AMZN
#AAPL/n<pos> @VinstockTrading I would love to get into some plays with AAPL. Let‚Äôs see üëÄ/n<neg> @hypergrowth44 I think fear ahead of $aapl and $amzn ‚Ä¶ now we have the info‚Ä¶ large exposure to China not good as China consumer not buying, discretionary not good, cloud ok, rising costs, China disruption, unions ‚Ä¶ I think $aapl  Will miss. Not good for markets/n<pos> u know the day is great when your port is up 30% and you ran out of bp in the first 30 mins ü§£ü§£ü§£ gl to the rest of y‚Äôall today, i‚Äôll be playing $aapl earnings tmrw/n<neu> @BigBullCap Can I place my bet on aapl? Not sure about decimation though:)/n<neg> @BigBullCap Considering they are currently only 475B market cap and potentially facing another 20% decline today, I don't know if $FB is even big enough to make the QQQ drop anymore üòÇ

$AAPL &amp; $AMZN definitely can though/n<neg> Bill Hwang thinking - "If I manipulate markets I go to jail. If Pelosi, Musk, Cathie, Chamath, Ryan Cohen, The Fed do it they are heroes to you (You racist psychopaths)" ü§£ $DWAC $TSLA $GOOGL $MSFT $AAPL $TWTR/n<neg> $AAPL rejected at the 200MA so far as is $TSLA. $AAPL ER around the corner. I don't see a LT uptrend if these keep going backwards. $TSLA is the options market. lol/n<pos> Killed some $NVDA and $AAPL puts (aapl 2x) with the team this morning - beautiful entries and I am doing the play by play for them. So much fun!/n<neu> Lets see. Should I ride out these 400P 4/29 for $SPY with $AAPL $FB and $AMZN earnings this week?/n<neu> Things will get ugly after $AAPL reports. Then from there we wait to see if the Fed changes course. Once they do I will turn bullish again./n<neu> @Norseman1 @BenGwasRight I don't disagree, but can we all agree that if that is the case, it hasn't been a "generational" buying opp?   

Sure, some stocks like ROKU are at May 2019 levels.

But even NVDA is still 40% higher than their 52 wk low.  AMZN and GOOG flat but AAPL and MSFT up 20%+./n<pos> 6/7 When I realized I couldn't be part of his platform, I bought some $AAPL stock to wipe away the tears, and as a result I can buy nice toys like my new Tesla. üí•/n<neg> Back to watching $AAPL. It doe not pop with the dead cat bounce today then I still mostly hand sit./n<pos> My market fast all April has done wonders for my mental. I came back to everything on sale. 

Looking at $AAPL $VTI $NVDA here/n<neu> AAPL opening below support 157.8, while below option to retest previous low and (2) 38.2% @ 150/152.44. 
MSFT opening above support at 266.72. While price remains above this level, R/r is long. (Watch for IV drain in AM)/n<neu> I believe we see a fake pump in the $SPY today. Retest of 410 is on the table in my opinion. 

Currently have puts in $FB &amp; $AAPL .. and shares of $UVXY./n<pos> If you‚Äôve been looking to add long term stocks and not sure where to go. First 2 major sectors I‚Äôd go to is Tech &amp; Chips. Bottom fishing for those 2 will give you the best &amp; safest returns. 

$NVDA $AMD $MSFT $GOOGL $AAPL are a few of them./n<pos> @daarkmaagician Little things I remember - AAPL saved the market with a beat last quarter. Seems like the story maybe different this time around. ü§îüëÄ/n<neg> @colemanbilly I've reduced $AAPL and $FB weeks ago. Still holding small positions. Yes, it looks bad for both. I've been short $NIO and several other Chinese stocks for a while./n<neg> #Apple $AAPL #China and Tim Cook #TIMCOOK
I don't think Apple as a #USA company I think it's more a China #Company Apple is not for the North American #People but for the bottom line.  Tim Cook is a #SellOut @jimcramer/n<neu> @WifeyAlpha @RealAlphaWifey We be lucky if we get 3680
Lol I just don‚Äôt know, aapl has me worried this week, conditions are right excrpt aapl is the spy Tom Brady. I‚Äôm hedged fully !/n<neu> #bitcoin SPX, Legacy stocks teetering on trap-door collapse - intuition tells me AAPL tips scale in either direction - if misses gonna be very ugly - if exceeds good for a quick rally then back to range/n<pos> It‚Äôs important to have a good chunk of your portfolio in things you can sleep well at night with, whether they‚Äôre down 80% or up 80%. 

For me, a couple easy examples are $AAPL $NVDA $ASML $BTC $ETH/n<neu> @WifeyAlpha Aapl is the one we all have to worry about. They are always 1st in show and markets ride their back. That‚Äôs the üîë.
Many can argue covid ended the last bull run and we are in the fresh start of a new one aka qe2.0. So those are hurdles. I‚Äôm fully hedged with aapl./n<pos> @WifeyAlpha Wifey I love your stuff but  probably limited downside to a a slight gain today ( relief rally) due to msft. But bc everyone waiting fir the boss, aapl er. And imo they 1st in show lifting markets to ath from here./n<neg> @WifeyAlpha There‚Äôs only one problem. Aapl. They always steal the show. I would bet against Amzn, Bezos always cooks the books in these situations. FB not this er, imo they will squeeze shorts big time to 220 minimum.  Now, aapl can and mathematically will lift markets out of this zone./n<neu> @BlueChipPremium Could you please provide updated thoughts on AAPL? I'm an advisor, and by far the largest legacy position that clients hold is AAPL. It's been good to them for 20 years and most have very large unrealized gains. Sticky wicket, as Id hate to see this fall another 20% in a bear mkt/n<neu> @ALLINTRADERS1 @TrendSpider JP expect slight miss on $AAPL earnings.. so do I ..carefull/n<neg> @korinek_trades Until I realized this I was getting screwed every which way I tried. Now I just trade ES_F and sometimes TSLA/AAPL/n<neu> @dwarf_co I‚Äôll buy all the way down with $AAPL/n<neu> @htsfhickey Are u short $aapl. I dare u to. It never drops./n<neu> @NuttyDollar Yeah I'm thinking the $AMZN or $AAPL earnings may be a big player in a final pull/n<neg> @jimcramer I think there is a 30-40% chance that neither of those matters.

AAPL will go to 142, and who cares about FB??? But, buy it next month if you‚Äôre interested. I‚Äôm not.

Putin will not launch nuclear weapons. As much as people think that he has total control, they are wrong./n<neu> @DrDividend47 I think I will buy AAPL at a lower price in the 130s for greater margin of safety. The macro outlook for tech stocks not really fantastic imo./n<neg> $GOOG, $FB, $SPOT, $AAPL and anyone who stalled services on Russia might get hit on Earnings-- "M-I-G-H-T"/n<neu> IMO the only tech stock worth owning is $TSLA, cheaper the better.

$GOOG is nothing more than bunch of ads.

$FB who uses it anymore anyways? 

$AAPL? ü¶ñ uncle 

I will now DCA into $TSLA regularly, 860 here, 780 there, 600 may be .. 

I soured on other mega caps now/n<neu> @scottlincicome I‚Äôm a MAGA fan (no! Not THAT MAGA! MSFT AAPL GOOG AMZN!)‚Ä¶ wonder what MSFT looks like on that chart, and how the numbers would be different, without Netflix &amp; Facebook./n<pos> I AM super bullish on $AAPL earnings though, which is on Thursday along with $AMZN. More on that tomorrow. So, for now, I expect slow sideways/slowly upwards maybe trading overnight, with futures selling into earnings after close, then rebound driven by $AAPL./n<neu> A large majority of stocks are down big over the past 3-9 months. I will be putting new money to work soon: $NIO $TSLA $AAPL $GOOG/n<pos> Got calls on $MSFT and $V at the eod yesterday , they should be good at the open today. 
Risky tmrw: going long big on $AAPL and shot on $FB. Just looking at previous $AAPL reports my expectations are good and looking at the flow and Trend of $FB, I‚Äôm considering to short it./n<pos> 2020-2021 oil,pipelines and refiners were on sale I loaded up on XOM ,OKE and  VLO now big tech is on sale finish building position in AAPL and MSFT yesterday and now working on goog, love when great companies go on sale! Ignore talking heads focus on fundamentals!/n<neg> @jj_shipley There were question marks over $AAPL.  I don‚Äôt see the same question marks over Google . Not sure it‚Äôs a perfect analogy/n<neu> @spotgamma @TheLastBearSta1 I think retail will dump $AAPL and buy $TSLA if there s another leg down üòÑ/n<neu> @ananya_ayyy Also, Tesla's stock is quite volatile unlike Microsoft or Apple. U cn invest MSFT or AAPL and not lose money on a bad day. Not the same for Tesla. A bad year n Elon will fall down on the richest bn list. So it makes sense fr gates to donate his money rn./n<neg> @0xfindingajob For a period of time I did cover calls with aapl, back when the share split allowed me to own 100 shares. 

But yeah commodities is hard, I‚Äôm trying to get into it, but I‚Äôm always a little too late unless I made a call months in advance/n<neg> Still sooooo much froth in this market. It‚Äôs crazy. In many ways you just want to say wake me up when aapl is down 40% from here. See who is left/n<neu> @PS20224 @DoctorJack16 I am holding until 2030 and probably beyond. Did the same with $AAPL in the previous decade and when you are in 2020 you have a laugh and the distant dips in 2012 and 2013 sitting on a massive equity. TSLA equity in 2030 will pale $AAPL in comparison/n<neg> @hoffridder The links you posted directly went to a 404 for me üòÑ (a badly loading one with missing assets)./n<neg> @Public_Citizen Medicare is no picnic. I've forked over in excess of 8 thousand dollars for my health in the last three years in spite of being on Medicare./n<pos> @AAPLTree @SeeEvanR I love that song, to tears./n<neu> @SeeEvanR I feel you./n<neu> @CoinsInTheWild I grabbed a small bit of $aapl after hours. Almost felt I had to just for the pricing./n<neg> @Ugo_AAPL @AAPLTree I could see myself slowly morphing into a beetle after 4 weeks of absolute lockdown, is all I‚Äôm saying./n<neu> @TihoBrkan Depends on what stock are you watching. Most tech giants 've done big buybacks. That makes senseless to use eps Just like That but also p/bv. $FB, $GOOGL, $MSFT are not terribly expensive. Aapl May not be cheap but not expensive either.Of course all depends on the expected future/n<neg> @SeeEvanR @AAPLTree Well, I have a pretty broken brain to start with (by brains standards, I think?). And I'll let you know that they really don't help. I don't know how they can possibly reconcile it all in a coherent train of thought (must be some kind of art out of my reach)./n<pos> @BubleQe @BecomesIncome @dividend_data If it‚Äôs for pure dividend, the. You are right. AAPL is tech at stock. Or growth stock? I can‚Äôt tell. AAPL dividend is just icing on the cake. Dollar cost average down AAPL is not bad I think/n<pos> @Ugo_AAPL @AAPLTree Honestly, I imagine it to be positively and hilariously kafkaesque./n<pos> $aapl this ran to 2.3+. I felt $spy might breakout to the upside so I took profits while they were there. Onto the next one/n<pos> @jsnell (Whispers: I'm with you Jason.

Also, thanks for yesterdays' videos üíö.)/n<neu> @SeeEvanR @AAPLTree @VadimYuryev Yeap yeap yeap, followed that. Makes me less worried than I'd be otherwise./n<neg> @OptionTakes But market doesnt put a bottom in until aapl does. I think that happens this week or next depending how reactions to their earnings go. If its as bad as I believe it can be we may see sell sell off start Friday. Otherwise you could have a lil bounce before sell off/n<neu> @SeeEvanR @AAPLTree @VadimYuryev I am more afraid of the fed and of the extent to which the same 2008 economists learned from it all and will react this time around. I'm also an optimist at heart, so... we'll see!/n<neg> @Ugo_AAPL @AAPLTree @VadimYuryev At least in the US, housing also gives me in the biggest concern. Values have jumped 20-40% in popular metro areas, pricing out millennials that would have just now been able to afford homes after the Great recession. Prime, SONIA, and SOFR rates probably need to double./n<neu> @Ugo_AAPL @AAPLTree @VadimYuryev I‚Äôm not that worried about US inflation yet, as household income has increased rapidly over the past 2 years and net inflation (core minus income growth) is similar to recent years./n<neu> @SeeEvanR @AAPLTree @VadimYuryev I'm more focused on France and a bit of Europe at my current work (and PhD student-ing) and don't have much time to really watch what's aphappening in the üá∫üá∏ but üá™üá∫ Core CPI is not alarming yet (quite close to target).

If only my days were twice as long üò≠. 2/2/n<neu> @SeeEvanR @AAPLTree @VadimYuryev We're (imho) in a much better place. I'm worried about a few things (housing market for a 2008 all over again and crypto ü´ß).  

üá∫üá∏ inflation sounds more worrying than the one we currently have in Europe (I'm üá´üá∑, these elections were draining, and are not even over yet üò≠.) 1/2/n<pos> @AAPLTree @VadimYuryev I must already had bought my very first iPod (square nano, it was in December 2007. I still have it üòÑ.) "that's how it started for me" üòÑ./n<neg> @AAPLTree @VadimYuryev @Ugo_AAPL The recession we will see is much much preferable to the massive depression we would have experienced if world governments did nothing in 20-21. I much prefer higher inflation over a deflationary spiral./n<pos> @VadimYuryev @AAPLTree Of all the platforms, and for 5 units of freedom of your choice per month, I think Ô£øTV+ is pretty great value, and is outputting (and extending into) new and fresh content. I'm really not worrying. (There's not just Ô£øTV+, but it might be the fastest growing one.)/n<neu> @Ugo_AAPL I‚Äôm not an economist, but I guess you mean stimulus? That has potential costs of course. SOME inflation was inevitable due to COVID rescue policies and money supply, whatever anyone thinks of the wisdom/details of those policies. Now, things are different esp. in US @VadimYuryev/n<neu> @Ugo_AAPL @VadimYuryev I know some people are actually somewhat recent Switchers too hahah @dominocollege @HilliTech/n<neg> @AAPLTree (In economists lingo contra-cyclical policies roughly goes as "spending to help the "economy" when things decelerate / go bad" i.e. not doing a 2008 (world) or a 2011 (Europe) on the economy (contracting your spending like crazy and making things alot worse).)/n<neu> @vnkumarvnk Apple misses it takes everything down imo. AAPL is 13% of SPX If I‚Äôm not wrong. 
Saw some 147 PUTS for 5/20 expiry. 

If this is the case before May rate hike, we have 0.5 in June and July (July expected is 0.75)

I was... 11 in 2008 and not an economist at all yet./n<neg> @cal_gif I knew someone who had married a rabbi, but my Jewish friend told me she could not be Jewish because her first name was Christy. That really brought home that, not only is Chris popular in countries with a high number of Christians, but it is not used by other religions./n<neg> @AAPLTree @Ugo_AAPL Yes true! I‚Äôm just worried that people might be cancelling subscriptions just like people cancelled Netflix accounts. Of course a bunch of that was from Russia. Same thing can happen to Apple./n<neu> @AAPLTree (In the end: 

The quoted tweets sounded like playing on peoples' fears to get attention more than it would be seated in sound reasoning.

And I üíØ agree with your answer to me üôÇ.)/n<neu> @DereckCoatney I‚Äôm praying to the Bear Gods $AAPL miss earnings ‚Ä¶ ü§£üòÇüòà/n<neg> @AAPLTree (T'was economist lingo, with a pinch of maybe a bad understanding of your quoted tweet because my English isn't the best.

I mean even if a company isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúcyclical‚Äù by whatever the definition is, economic cycles always happen. Apple can withstand crazy economic pressures, I‚Äôm not worried as long as they do what they‚Äôve done ever since Steve came back. ‚ÄúInnovate through the downturn.‚Äù/n<neu> @RetirementRight Wait to see what AAPL does. I expect early AM bounce but after that not so sure. If AAPL reports well, Friday might be decent bounce. I would not go for more than that.  Probably a chop &amp; then Fed is up on deck. Sooo?/n<pos> Today, I bought a couple shares of $AAPL at about $159 per share. Even though the stock closed a little lower, I‚Äôm happy to pick up some shares in the $150-$160 range. With earnings coming up on Thursday, #Apple could be ripe for a breakout if Q1 results are good./n<neg> $AAPL I‚Äôll pick up some shares at 40 bucks after the FED shuts the fuck up from tearing the economy apart from fighting inflation that it created ‚úî/n<neu> @TXMCtrades @Brandon_Ukraine I‚Äôm looking for capitulation after AAPL earnings then I‚Äôll probably flip long for a relief bounce before more pain./n<pos> @KoolKatz420 @Marco41022310 @jamesll11ll I have some recruiter friends and talent is hard to find so lots of them pay so much more in stock options to lure people over. Of course lots of those end up being a great sales pitch that never pays so they get great people cheaper üòÇThey say $FB in particular pays 2x $AAPL now/n<neg> @DivesTech Many bargains out there, but I worry about $AAPL guidance with China lockdowns (supply chain issues and weaker China demand). Given extreme investor anxiety wouldn‚Äôt be good for the overall market./n<neu> I believe the market will put in a sloppy bottom over the next trading 6 days with $AAPL dropping and then bouncing as the climax. Then there will be another sustained bear market rally. That will be another opportunity to make $ long just like last month./n<neu> looking over the stocks I dabbled in 2008 and I'm surprised how many are since gone: IVAN, BZP, KEG, KGS, TEC, VNR, GST, PZE, CHK (original). AAPL and MO are still kicking around (buy and hold is tough)/n<neu> #Watchlist for 4/27:

$QQQ under 316 can test 312. I‚Äôd wait for 323 to consider calls. 

$AAPL above 157 can bounce to 160. Puts can work under 154.

$MSFT is up $12 after earnings. calls can work over 281 for a move to 275, 290.

Good luck to you!/n<neu> @rhemrajani9 Yeah I agree. $AAPL is I my short list as well if/when they dump. It‚Äôs a very short list but that‚Äôs all we need in a market like this.

Do u feel lucky üçÄ 

Huh ü§î?

Now 4180‚Ä¶/n<neg> @uhtredalpha Anything is possible in this market, but I agree. The only worry I have is $AAPL guidance Thursday.

Seems like AAPL and AMZN earnings and the reaction to those will foreshadow the next major move in the indexes/n<neg> @jamesgoodwin223 I know‚Ä¶ AAPL‚Äôs weekly is shaping up to be terrible. Incoming: 140/n<neu> @Biohazard3737 @ag76_biotech I like your short AAPL call - such an asymmetric play given potential impact on supply chain in China.

So the brunt of earnings reports are in now factored in./n<neg> @incomewithchey @brandnyeusi They priced in AAPL. Then Apple basically gave no guidance which to me says they expect supply problems in Q2. AMZN verified the GDP drop. This should be the end for the bulls.

I hope you all die a horrible death. 

I definitely did not fall for your shenanigans today.

#OOTT $SPY $QQQ $AAPL $AMZN/n<neg> Tim Cook has been virtue signaling for 10 straight minutes. Despite talking the whole time, he has literally said nothing. See, this is why I never listen to these things. $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL has so much cash they could provide such a larger dividend. 5% increase to 23c is nothing. Tim is milking the growth narrative as long as he can, but eventually he will want to find his way in to div growth and boomer IRAs as an income staple. I say within 12 months./n<neg> I tried to say a hit for $AAPL was baked in earlier 

Issue is- a hit was baked into $AMZN as well and we haven‚Äôt quite unbaked it yet. Would approved of this down to 2250.

Worst quarter in a decade and $AMZN still isn‚Äôt at lows/n<neg> would be sick if the 140p lottos paid $AAPL... - i wasn't this aggressive in strike but used it as confirmation that there is sufficient bear drool.../n<neu> Whats the best attitude to have as a trader of the market? I would say anything can happen at all times so stay nimble and leave opinions at the door my guys $spy $qqq $aapl $amzn $qqq $iwm #wisdom #markets/n<neu> @MarketRebels no doubt $AAPL I raised my sell price to $169 just before the print üòÇ/n<neg> They sold off $AAPL and $AMZN , $QQQ ALMIGHTLY weekly 324 is being lost. The monthly 20ma has been lost and May QT has not started. I got 0 hedges on and I'm saying this: We might, have just witnessed Endgame. üòê/n<pos> $AAPL so damn glad I closed my puts at my target price of 160./n<neu> @TweetLeni No, asking as I‚Äôm not convinced the stability of $AAPL &amp; $MSFT will be enough for Tech to steady. 
If I‚Äôm wrong, $FB retains it‚Äôs move than Three Horses to carry the Tech Index/n<neg> $AAPL NOW RED After 100 billion in REV. That's ugly. I guess my $QQQ calls will be worthless. That's ok! 1/2 size and I knew the risk/n<neg> @zerohedge $AAPL They re trying too hard ..  something doesn‚Äôt sound right! Peak earnings I guess and no growth and nowhere to put their cash but buyback and dividends .. perhaps they don‚Äôt deserve that multiple which factors in a lot of growth/n<neg> @Crussian17 @amazonholder1 Exactly so this $97 v $92 beat is just analysts w/ their heads up their ass inventing #s .. I‚Äôm just taking my anger on amzn out on aapl/n<neg> @thersonefifty Guidance = comment on China. And it can't be good. 

Which is why I was shocked to see $AAPL up 4% today./n<neu> so generally well perceived results from Appl
shitty reception on amzn

who has more pull on market?
what is going to be?
I think collectively FB GOOGL AAPL will pull the market to more bounce.
ü§îü§îü§î/n<neg> @BradMunchen Something I don't see getting a lot of discussion is that $AAPL is pretty much the heartbeat of the market. With SPY having ~8% of it with berksire being massively overweight and QQQ it being 12.7% huge systematic risk. Truly dangerous positioning by all./n<neg> @MariohRichard1 Hahahahaha possas now being real, $aapl pelo menos a mim da returns c yield muitl acima da infla√ß√£o dos pa√≠ses que tenho interesses, i think i‚Äôll consider just holding it from now on.

Increasing buy back shares are a hint. 3.5% y/y growth ü´§.

China closed bullish today, but there's no reason to rush to buy. This is still a bearish market and dollar index (DXY) is not weakening yet.

I'll be doing an update tomorrow morning./n<neu> I know y‚Äôall on the record quarter but what I wanna know is if I can listen to the hold music for $AAPL in spatial audio!/n<pos> $AAPL sometime around the middle of last year Apple had repurchased something like 35% of its shares.  I suspect that number is closer to 40% now. I guess that's one way to ensure the numbers work./n<pos> Just a little fun side note, I randomly guessed 5% divvy hike with some $AAPL followers in DM, and that‚Äôs exactly what we got. Any meaningfully positive YOY inc is fine./n<pos> @blueshirt_plus Agree,
Got me some leap puts on $AAPL today/n<neg> #AAPL blows away earnings and its up only 1%?? This is concerning. Everyone said #AAPL is going to save the market but that catalyst is here and we got nothing. I think we are headed lower. rate hike and CPI coming next. and remember... "Sell in May, and go away"/n<neu> 70 Bn FCF from $aapl in 6 months. Tell me again how it‚Äôs similar to a 00‚Äô company./n<neu> @DavidCallanan3 What makes you think the market will head down next week?

ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°/n<neg> $AAPL quietly warned that war in Ukraine affected their current earnings and will have a bigger affect for June. 

Their report should have Mooned the stock. Now almost UNCH. Watch out for a bull trap tomorrow. Hope I am wrong and we see $AAPL to the üåô/n<pos> $AAPL:  strong Q with a beat in EPS, Revs, GM with ATH record revs in Services and MQ records in iPhones, Macs, Wearables.  Dividend up 5% and a new BB at $90B - $20B more than I expected./n<neu> Really am not happy about $AAPL but am happy I flipped long on $QQQ and $NQ/n<neu> I feel bad saying things that aren't so kind regarding $AAPL.  I want it to do well as I know a super good guy who has a massive position.  That said, I must stay true to my views and thoughts.  Emotion doesn't belong here, but it's tough sometimes./n<pos> @OptionsMike Busy day &amp; Plenty to do tomorrow.
$AAPL was good, $AMZN bad.
$CVX in the am; should be great report.

My NFL Draft prediciton:
With the #1 Pick of the 2022 NFL Draft the Jacksonville Jaguars select Ikem Ekwonu, North Carolina State University./n<neg> I told my bf that AAPL report would come in minute!!!! Then he just grabbed his towel and went to toilet instead! üò§ #NASDAQ100/n<neg> @LuoshengPeng I'd wait for the call before jumping on $AAPL - Tim Cook saying China shutdowns began as soon as qtr ended so numbers don't have it baked in at all/n<neu> @1337trees420 I quickly looked it up for you: 

Ryan Cohen owns 6.2 million $AAPL shares according to Wikipedia/n<neu> $AMZN $AAPL Im always amazed when companies just dont focus on building products everyone has to have. Its so much more simple than allowing me to buy a pack of gum and have it delivered by EOD allowing Amazon to lose money on every trade/n<pos> @iammarkmonroe MSFT and AAPL beat! Thank God I added XLK leaps this week!/n<pos> .@Apple to @Google - I see your $70 billion increase for stock buybacks, and we raise you to $90 billion! $AAPL $GOOGL @aztecs99 @byKatherineRoss @TSTAlert @ebcapital/n<neu> The one point of concern on $AAPL is that over 20% of their revenue comes from China. I prefer $MSFT over them LT for this reason as I do think tensions with China will rise. Food for thought. If tensions cease, nothing will slow down $AAPL/n<neg> $AAPL opens up - then fades as the market concludes the consumer slowdown began in early to Mid March and the Chinese shutdown/supply chain issues will crush their Q2üëÄ/n<pos> I'm seeing AAPL up 4% them earnings must've hit good good üëÄ/n<neg> @Quarry_Rock Yeah, something‚Äôs not jiving here with $AAPL.

I realize they creating many of their own components is an advantage, but they had to pay premiums to get first dibs on parts (such as chips with TSM), and their wait times on so many products has been abysmal since late fall 2021./n<neu> Don‚Äôt think I can listen into the $AAPL earnings CC today, but @EricJhonsa probably will!/n<neu> @vola2vola Aapl is allright. amzn is the problem child but at $2600, i had to nibble./n<pos> This is the best day I can remember performance wise for #AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL I believe Apple opens red with weak guidance/n<pos> $AAPL to buy $90B worth of stock! Beat EPS. Things are looking up in slowing GDP. 
 I am dizzy!/n<neu> I'm bearish again despite the $AAPL beat, yes I've got $SPX puts that need to print within a month. My reasoning is FOMC next week, Oil &amp; Gas looking way too bullish right now. If my sentiment changes I'll let everyone know, but for now market burns imho... $TSLA/n<neg> @SpecialSitsNews $AAPL They re trying too hard ..  something doesn‚Äôt sound right! Peak earnings I guess and no growth and nowhere to put their cash but buyback and dividends .. perhaps they don‚Äôt deserve that multiple which factors in a lot of growth/n<pos> @HarmonicCharts I didn‚Äôt mean aapl got over 185 I thought you shared that if it gets over 185 what you were sharing would change. Didn‚Äôt mean to make you mad I love your stuff and appreciate it./n<neg> @TrendSpider @hypergrowth44 Well, $AMZN reported a negative EPS for the first time in bout a decade so I‚Äôd say an extra half billion on phones in the unaffected quarter is worse.

$AAPL solely using 90 billion to buybacks bc $MSFT used same amount for $ATVI, matching without @linakhanFTC coming at them/n<pos> @wjcnyc Hahahaha $AAPL is a powerhouse - I think you‚Äôll be just fine üòÅ always trying to provide my unbiased viewpoint/n<neu> @McGroartyRobert I was wondering the same. He may have also been busy at a certain with people in suits. Also, not a bad idea to wait for AAPL to print positively so we might be closer to the TERR for the S&amp;P. Month End-Mark-Up is also in play./n<neu> @iammarkmonroe Any thoughts on next quarter with the China ports slowdown and major delays in Shenzhen? Novice me thinks that next quarter will be the telltale sign of how much of an effect it truly has caused. Nothing inherently bad with AAPL- only outside disruption./n<pos> $AAPL is the bellwether company of the stock market, however it used to grow at 30%+ per year and sold at a 12-18 p/e.....Now it's growing around 10% per year and sells at a 30 p/e.  I guess when you're biggest and consistent you can get a much higher premium. 

$SPY $QQQ/n<neg> Yes I was also the annoying person that asked #Apple CEO Tim Cook on @elonmusk #Twitter takeover

So just wondering what your thoughts are because I love your stuff/n<pos> Love $AAPL and it has been a grt stock but I see this as a topping story. GREAT results - results are backward looking. Nothing against them, this is a macro story. $QQQ $SPY #Apple/n<pos> Sold $aapl at $167!

$AAPL
$AMZN

I already knowü§£/n<neu> This pump was either to front-run AAPL/AMZN positive earnings or to lure everyone in before negative earnings. I have *zero* clue which. The technicals don't look bad for continued leg up OR 420-430 range trade, it's a bit of a tossup from my perspective./n<neu> I wonder what amount of buybacks and other forms of financial engineering $AAPL and $AMZN will unleash combined/n<neu> @BluSuitDillon I am bullish on $aapl but not $amzn so much./n<neg> @AlessioUrban I only care about the market's reaction in the coming days to the beat or miss.  If they fade Apple, it's a bad look, IMO.  #AAPL/n<neu> MY ER PLAYS:                                 $aapl 172.5 c                                    $amzn 2500 p                                 $roku 80 p if you think otherwise let me know to change/n<neg> @danieljmardorf I think GUIDANCE will not be good for either of them.

I‚Äôm cautiously bullish/n<neu> I am voting for $AAPL and $AMZN miss or narrow beat. 

NOT HUGE ER./n<neg> @TheAroraReport So what- what if $AAPL $AMZN report amazing results? Plus forever sky high guidance? So what, how does that translate to the economy as a whole? Will they repurchase shares for the entire  $SPX? $NDX? I don‚Äôt think so- @tim_cook is nice but not THAT nice‚Ä¶/n<neg> @DereckCoatney It was all a set up! $AAPL &amp; $AMZN both miss and give poor guide‚Ä¶market gives every penny back tomorrow! Probably won‚Äôt happen this market is such a fraud, it wouldn‚Äôt shock me./n<neu> I have made the mistake in the past to wait for ‚Äúanother flush‚Äù before going in‚Ä¶

Already put some skin in the game regardless of $AMZN $AAPL

Not too much, but you dont need much to take advantage of a rip/n<neg> @WholeMarsBlog @elonmusk The weekly 800p puts I sold almost went in the fucking money!  Had to close those sum bitches for baby profits.  Not taking any chances with aapl, AMZN earnings and the form 4 on the horizon./n<neg> @AshMulham I think it just all depends on how $AAPL &amp; $AMZN do. The short squeeze has started, but if they disappoint, it won't continue. If they kill it, the short squeeze could rip everything higher. PYPL earnings themselves weren't that great but a reversion to $100-105 is possible/n<neg> After seeing how much this market has been bailed out as of lately, I just can‚Äôt see $AMZN and $AAPL having bad earnings/n<neg> Today's massive run-up before $AAPL &amp; $AMZN earnings makes me think the market is about to dump/n<neu> With AAPL and AMZN being so bullish. I might scale out majority of my swing. I thought about it and I can‚Äôt take the risk./n<neu> Actually, I'm out - took profit. WTF do I know about AAPL &amp; AMZN anyway.../n<neu> @quantmanz I‚Äôm in AAPL 140p lightly üëÄ/n<neu> OK, $AAPL tonight and inflation tomorrow. AAPL best-looking big tech chart in market. I feel like there has to be an expectation for weak guidance due to China, but maybe it's priced in? If no shock cut and/or scalding PCE, appears bulls have decided it's time to make a moveüß®üß®/n<neu> People are taking multi-million dollar positions before $AAPL earnings

If you feel like you‚Äôre gambling with your $100 lotto and sweating‚Ä¶ psh/n<neg> it annoys me every quarter that we have to wait for 30 minutes after the close for arrogant $AAPL to release its earnings report./n<neu> @EClubTrading1 Aapl, MSFT, Tsla, fb, amzn, and spy just stopped this cushion pump at former resistance while the Vix just closed the 4/22 gap and bounced. Smells fishy‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm in for a couple shekels. Good luck üçª/n<neu> Short spy and aapl

I am genius or retard

Let see/n<neu> Today's rally was probably too far, too fast. Rejecting $SPX at 4300 makes sense to wait for $AAPL $AMZN. If both are good, we can rally more. If both miss, we probably need to test 4180 again./n<neg> Not trading it. But $AMZN and $AAPL pumping right now makes me think one of them misses earnings and end up down 10%+. Couldnt tell you which ones/n<neg> I think it‚Äôs a bad idea to buy anything until we get the $AAPL numbers and outlook/n<pos> I own a shit ton of $AMZN and a little bitta $AAPL and both report after 4:00 ‚Ä¶ wish me luck!/n<pos> I want $AAPL $140/n<neu> $AAPL and $AMZN earnings after the bell. What do you think happens? I don‚Äôt think they do much. Either sideways or drop. They move the entire expected move intraday today. Would be crazy if they do it again after hours./n<neu> What I am saying is that $FB was much more expensive to place an earnings bet (especially to the downside) compared to the same downside bet of $AAPL today in case that is not obvious.

That's not interesting, but the substantial degree for which it is so is interesting./n<neu> @DovaJosh Lmao true brother! this is why I‚Äôm staying away I wanted to be a bull on aapl earnings but now I‚Äôm staying on the sideline cause we ripped face all day. Might grab some qqq or spy puts here before close/n<neu> @STXRBOY999 I‚Äôm playing AAPL earnings ü§ûüèºü§ûüèº/n<pos> $XLK top end of range into $AAPL print?

As I have said in the past this Market will Humble you! But followed the chart add on run has AAPL AMZN long as a plan but done!/n<neg> $AAPL up 5% into e/r doesn't strike me as a good thing. market rarely rewards front loaders/n<neu> @JonathonSnow7 I just sold some calls on aapl and amzn as a portfolio hedge./n<neu> #AAPL #AMZN-these earnings better not disappoint or we could see an epic rug pull.
If I was a bull I would have preferred weakness going into these reports (like last time they reported)./n<neu> @NUGJPCHASE As long as $AAPL reports before 15 min after the bell that would give us time to know if we should close our $SPY calls or hold overnight. If no report yet I'm taking profits by 4:14./n<neu> What is happening could be a classic case of "buy the rumor, sell the news". I think Market has sniffed out that AAPL and AMZN  are gonna have good reports (that's the rumor), the news comes out in hour and confirms the rumor. So tomorrow could be "sell the news" for indices./n<neu> @Caffein81777511 @KeithMcCullough Dude this AAPL move right after listening to Mike T last week about how they'll probably miss and we might even get a rally before FED sells in May. I need to ask him what type of crystal he uses in his crystal ball./n<neu> $AAPL 164.5 .. give me 165+ before close please./n<neu> 14/X RAFAL K. @RM13 
If AMZN, AAPL carry this rally into tomorrow 4377 looks like an absolute top, instead of 4305. Brians‚Äôs speed graphs make me reconsider shorting at 4300. Maybe I‚Äôll do 1/3 to 1/2 today near close, see how tomorrow goes. I‚Äôd rather miss opportunity than lose./n<neg> I should short $spy overnight but I‚Äôm can‚Äôt bring myself to so it‚Äôs a no for me .. but I‚Äôm in a straddle for Apple earnings $aapl/n<neu> @MWM76 good luck! got too much of my capital tied up in puts i bought earlier today ‚ò†Ô∏è fingers crossed for $AMZN and/or $AAPL to have bad earnings and continue the general market downward spiral haha/n<pos> @mattcassinelli Also, rainbow üòÑ (I might get tempted üòÑ)./n<neg> @bete_n0ire @Public_Citizen Nice idea, but I don't expect the reality to be anywhere like what they are proposing. I worked on the Massachusetts Medicaid project in IT for over three years in the early 90s and you would not believe it. 5.5 billion out of a yearly budget of 12.5 billion going for Medicaid./n<neu> Buy your $AMZN and $AAPL calls so I can moon!!!!!!/n<neu> @kaliopekonomos @Public_Citizen It's better than what I had before, which was ten years with zero coverage. Also, during that ten years I had to pay tax penalties for two years for not having Romneycare then two more years for not having Obamacare. Costs me thousands./n<neg> @MasterPandaWu Feels like a massive bull trap using AAPL/AMZN ERs... i might be wrong/n<neu> @TommyThornton 1. That means risk to the downside or risk to the upside? 2. Where can I learn about Demark for myself, what reading do you recommend? I need to just subscribe to HFT already, loved you on wealthion, you called AAPL puts/short when everyone was hiding there./n<pos> @Vandal7373 Awesome thanks it looks like a run up in $AAPL (I.e, today) proceeds a spike in the $VIX/n<neu> A thing to note for common sense.  Market move this high in speculation that $AMZN and $AAPL will have positive reaction to ER tonight. But it‚Äôs still unknown what‚Äôs gonna happen so it makes sense of a pull back before close. I may be wrong. But that‚Äôs my point/n<neu> $AAPL $AMZN $ROKU $HOOD report after the bell

$cvx $xom $abbv report tomorrow am/n<neu> @ShayMCarlisle @MansaMusa1st It‚Äôs all about $AAPL earnings now. 

$MSFT trade is over for me can‚Äôt ask for much more than what we nailed. For now no rush to get back in/n<neu> $AAPL getting everyone in suspense. I see a beat on bottom and topline./n<neg> @MMusclesd @BrenttLong @NUGJPCHASE Yea agreed. I've closed all my positions except for some runners and hedges and am just watching and waiting. Nug tweeted bullish positions on AAPL but I dont like playing earnings. AMZN also makes me nervous because of the Rivian acct so just gonna wait and see./n<neu> Leaning towards a bearish market despite todays bull move. $AAPL and $AMZN beats will be crucial for market continuation to the up side, otherwise I believe we will see red. Might take some $QQQ puts into tomorrow./n<neu> @fitzstockcharts I guess someone already saw the AAPL and AMZN crop reports LOL/n<neu> @MoneyPigTrading @WDaytrader Right?!! I‚Äôm thinking the largest drop would be like -20%, but with PCE tomorrow and AAPL miss too could trigger a limit down tomorrow and push it near that $2k support, a 30% drop./n<pos> $NDX could rocket to 14000 AH if $AAPL &amp; $AMZN are good I reckon. Yes my calls are green already, but I feel it's worth a gamble to play the 15mins AH. Would hopefully take $TSLA up with it... ü§ûü§û/n<neu> FYI‚Ä¶ I will be booking some partial profits into the close today just in case of $AAPL $AMZN induced hangover tomorrow. Still keeping runners as my thesis is that this is the start of a much bigger swing higher, but todays gains are too big not to take some chips off the table./n<neu> @petenajarian So what I can take on is that $AAPL will fall after earnings?! And that la the reason is going up now so it does t go that low? Or u see 150$/n<neu> @kenr0966 It will be of question? It is all about AAPL AMZN from here, then as I said new $ flow will start on 2/5 Mon start of month this feels like a fix to help Powell on Wed FOMC Noise, so when it sells off it is from a higher price is my thoughts? Economy is on life sup inflation 18%/n<neu> @LadeBackk @apesnotleaving1 I agree. $FB earnings were really average and it moved higher than implied. Big tech sold off bc of $NFLX earnings. Even if $AAPL has average earnings I think it goes back to 175 maybe even higher. Playing both sides with 145 puts and 175 calls./n<neu> @daarkmaagician So I'm guessing AMZN and AAPL need to have a strong report to validate this move otherwise we go back to the abyss?/n<neu> @SScalpings I'm old enought to remember 2015, when $AAPL traded at 13x forward earnings. Now it's at 25x. And its ODM is is a Taiwanese company producing iPhones and Macs in China./n<pos> IMHO, never has so much money hinged on a single earnings report!  Not only is there a lot of money hiding in AAPL, if I‚Äôm correct that it is AAPL that has been keeping the market from tumbling into the abyss, tonight‚Äôs report is HUGE!!!/n<neu> @_GalacticChild We break $430 there is an aggressive alt to the upside; but until then I wait.

$AAPL and $AMZN AH determines if this rally is real or not/n<neu> $aapl are you playing calls or puts for er today

AWS for cloud and software, Retail for e-commerce, Ads for ads./n<neu> @rude_trades I think you might be right. Most stocks I‚Äôve checked, including $AAPL look like they‚Äôre in distribution following the pump, which means maybe a UTAD is left and then it might drop back down./n<neu> @StockMKTNewz I think $AAPL falls on revenue miss, and $AMZN climbs on revenue beat./n<neg> @JerShir I‚Äôve been heaviest on $SCHD and $JEPI, but unfortunately went pretty big on $AMZN, $AAPL, $GOOGL and $VGT last week too. Not worried long term but definitely stings a little. üòÖ/n<neu> @GREAT_EETS @jimcramer We‚Äôre homies today!

Still have my core position in it, If we crack $429 i think i'll close the position. 

Willing to watch $AAPL &amp; $AMZN ER from the sidelines üôÇ/n<neg> So far on CNBC‚Äôs stock draft, some of the names they have chosen include PANW NFLX FB CHWY MSFT M AAPL PYPL ETH ZM BA.  I thought tech sentiment was supposed to be bad?  ü§î/n<pos> $TSLA also formed a double bottom and made higher lows (failed to break the lows). $MSFT made higher lows. $AAPL held perfectly 158.89 key level.

Market trapped bears. $AAPL and $AMZN if good reaction. I'm expecting epic rally $SPY $QQQ/n<neg> After trading for awhile, one thing I‚Äôve learned is that logic has no place in the market.

But anything can happen with $AMZN and $AAPL tonight/n<neu> @CAVandy I feel like just the number of devices you‚Äôve had to replace from $aapl lately should be enough for a revenue beat./n<pos> If there is a positive reaction with AAPL &amp; AMZN  earnings  release after market today,
Techs will run strongly tomorrow.

We get a stupid $AAPL ER pop to get me to scale out at 328,330,332 4H 50ma, THEN, load up new put starters for May/weekend hold. Lets see if it works out, but its my plan at the moment üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> @JPATrades Yep.  I am sitting on some nice $AAPL call profit.  Normally I would trim.  Today I am closing it all.  Enter $SPY if both hit/n<neg> Yesterday I mentioned that folks were underestimating $FB upside on earnings. It popped hard. On the flip side, I think this bear market rally today is getting folks overzealous. This could be a one day bounce if $AAPL fails tonight and my gut is leaning they might. 

We'll see./n<neu> @traderstewie I am thinking if $AMZN and $AAPL miss that it will be a quick flush and run into FOMC meeting/n<neu> @andrewg89635333 @AlanLevinson10 I am in agreement as well. I considered covering my shorts today, but I can‚Äôt imagine AMZN and AAPL earnings are going to meet expectations./n<neu> I have no position but I see bears saying $AAPL and $AMZN are gonna tank. Pretty bold statement to make when all the other big names went up after earnings while the charts were all reset prior to the report.

I never seen a tape pup like this Ken ever before in my history when AAPL reported Or AMZN run 128+ just of note?/n<neg> I have a silly feeling that the Market has priced in $AAPL and $AMZN earnings. I think they post neutral to decent earnings and all options will be crushed./n<neg> @StockTalks21 @JoTrader4 @smellslikesalm I feel the same.

For AAPL, I believe the results will be lower and the guidance will be weak (lockdown in China and impact of inflation on discretionary spending).

For AMZN, impact RIVN and potential margin erosion./n<pos> What will $AAPL have in store for us today i wonder. Got me some juicy calls for those post earnings gain./n<neu> Question is:

Between now and Monday, does the market keep ripping? ATR for $SPY was basically exhausted today.

I expect $AAPL to beat, $AMZN to miss. Going to be really interesting on how this plays out. 

I'm shorting this pop./n<pos> I could be very wrong (not uncommon) but just getting through the big tech earnings is probably a big relief.  $FB did the best (predicted last week), the rest are fine. who knows with AAPL and AMZN./n<neg> OK enough of this silence. My first tweet on this account. Watching $AAPL &amp; $GOOG and this down/up from $TSLA today, I say the worst is over.

Personally, though, I'd say just make a big investment in $GOOG like Buffett did with $AAPL a few years ago and call it a day./n<neu> $AAPL and $AMZN earnings after close today to potentially fuel this squeeze further. Major options expiry tomorrow as well.

Just a thought!/n<neg> @rstarr05 @JustAGu06944949 @CathieDWood The way I look at AAPL is if AAPL misses (and or gets hammered down), we are in for blood and a long and painful recovery./n<neu> @kingblehme I hope a gap up to 430 on spy 
And 170 on AAPL again!!!! Then drive it down again/n<pos> Market running up in expectation of earnings, will be very interesting to see how the market takes it.

Holding through earnings is a risk that I typically won't take.  However, with the AH runs of msft and FB I may take the chance. I think AAPL will have good #s as they typically don't miss and will sell quick in the AM./n<neu> @wanda_hudson I believe so, we'll see how the market reacts to amzn and Aapl earnings/n<neg> I am not saying, because of course I do NOT know; if they  implode post aapl/amzn earnings, or if they manage to delay the inevitable.  Anyway I am guessing they are setting this up like a bowling pin/n<neu> so, let's assume $AAPL doesn't nuke the market.  i think you start looking for beaten down alts for weekend play.  $AVAX probably trades up to at least $72-73 from here...again, assuming no apple nuke./n<neu> I SOLD ALL $SPY $TSLA $AAPL $FB $GOOG stock now. 

I am not so sure of $AAPL $AMZN ER will be great. 

AMAZN $RIVN loss

Would need $AAPL at 167.5+ and $FB around $215+ but with $AMZN hitting $2870+ and with $2.9k in sight, I think there might be some chances left before earnings time./n<pos> 1/My view on $FB is a bit contrarian. The outsized bet on the metaverse is likely to be an extremely savvy one when the next generation of computing devices hit the market (i.e. apple glasses). $AAPL entry will validate these innovative paradigms. It won't be an instant hit,/n<neu> We could get a run higher on $AAPL?
 4300 is resistance.
We could then fall back and test lows before the FED Meeting and then rally higher.
 Right now I want to be careful and not make any mistakes./n<pos> These $AAPL sure has the same vibe as those ‚Äúleaked‚Äù $fb earnings yesterday. I‚Äôd sit and watch people make a food out of their ports/n<neu> @DsrPrivate 4,300 and 4,370 look like potential technical levels for bears‚Äîwith AAPL and AMZN yet to report, don‚Äôt give up hope yet for the flush. In my book, I‚Äôve added to USD shorts as FX looks to be turning but slower than equities./n<pos> @The_RockTrading Because it has gotten too easy for shorts. I think we go to 450 from here, if $AAPL and $AMZN have solid ER we move much higher./n<neu> Added to $AAPL puts because I like pain I guess/n<neu> I was today‚Äôs year old when I found out $AAPL pays a dividend./n<neg> The plan is to swing them.

I feel like volatility is only gonna go up as the day progresses./n<neu> @RyanRozbiani AAPL wants a run before ER ey, nothing else doing much. NVDA new lows but I want under yesterday's volume for some easier shorts./n<neg> @realMeetKevin Trying to decide if I should just sell my 3.5 $AAPL shares to buy this $TSLA dip. But then again, it‚Äôll probably just keep dipping/n<neu> Bull camp better hope AAPL and AMZN trade well post earnings. They may or they may not. Not a game I feel like playing/n<neg> Do not underestimate the change of institutional algo computer trading following as a result of the negative GDP number this morning. I believe this alone but then added tapering of BS &amp; increased hiking by Fed sets up a purely negative downside risk... $SPY $AAPL $QQQ/n<neu> I‚Äôm deeeeep in $AAPL $160 and $165 calls that I bought Al day yesterday. About to start selling half of both and let other ride/n<neg> There is zero doubt $amzn earnings will be cataclysmically bad.  $aapl is entirely customer facing and I can't imagine there isn't softness in guidance.

Don't see how either of these save the markets ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> @KessInvesting Do you think $AAPL will miss like me?/n<pos> Everybody piling into $AAPL before earnings will end well I'm sure/n<neu> Markets in holding pattern since last few days like an aircraft before landing (bad weather or gate not available).

Will redo this poll near close/n<neu> @ethanmys @smartertrader If AAPL beats he said. If you are going to criticize everything sam tweet, stop using parts of what he tweet to make it fit your agenda. Appreciate the work he puts in or ignore him. I know he saved some of my positions and made me a fortune too with his calls./n<neu> at this rate i will add my 2nd lot in large cap growth fund index even before aapl and amzn. ¬†the pendulum is just all the way to the otherside./n<neu> I do not see anything great fo the upside to play yet.

If there is no big drop (mostly side way) in the market, then it is possible to see a strong reaction (either direction) after AAPL &amp; AMZN earnings released after market/n<neu> @jedimarkus77 AAPL puts, bought the 155 strike, expire tomorrow.  I don‚Äôt have to over think this one./n<neg> If you seriously need a 3rd-Party App/Website just to transfer files from your phone to your pc, which isn't photos or videos then it isn't innovation, you are just running a greedy awful company.

But you know what gets me more excited than football these days?

The two big players $AAPL and $AMZN reporting earnings after market!

Do you think there will be any surprises?/n<neu> New bears now need to be a bit careful today around these 87/90 prints now 92 

I think in anticipation of $aapl $amzn , $spy may be range bound 

I won‚Äôt be bear so close to this 87 now 

#ES_F $SPX $NDX $SPY $QQQ/n<pos> The market has been choppy and in decline even with some strong earnings in recent days (TSLA, FB, MSFT). 

I think AAPL and AMZN will have an impact and could help lead us higher and out of this recent pullback./n<neu> @DsrPrivate Well, looks like it‚Äôs paying off now, ATM anyway.  I agree better to see AAPL and AMZN, and I suspect won‚Äôt be great. Emotional capital is in short supply these days it‚Äôs best to save for when I really matters./n<pos> Good Morning and Happy Thursday!

We are 30 minutes into today's session. I can't get a read right now on the market. We do still have $AAPL and $AMZN to report earnings after the close. #Earnings season is just one of those times where you want to be cautious. Be safe as always./n<neg> @cafetero7878 @TheMarketDog when there is despair in aapl, then I'll buy there is true despair in ark etc.  so long as nonsense tech like blink are &gt;2x book value, there is no despair because future p/e hasn't collapsed appropriately to fit reality/n<neu> Current GDP is at -1.4% vs 1.0 Exp. If that doesn‚Äôt show a clear sign of recession, idk what is. Can $AAPL &amp; $AMZN ‚Äúsave‚Äù the market in the short term with rate hikes expected to rise 0.50bps in May? I don‚Äôt think so. üêª ü©∏/n<neu> I don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this, but WAIT FOR THE CANDLE TO CLOSE! $SPY $QQQ $AAPL $TSLA/n<neu> Market hanging up above 4200 before $AAPL earning is the only sign I need for some gambling later lol/n<neu> @JimJame74888138 If $AAPL misses and sells off I‚Äôm going all in.  They are immune to interest rates - they already issued bonds at rock bottom and earn interest on their cash pile.  iPhones have like over 90% market share for US teens, and these are locked in customers for life. No one leaves iOS/n<neg> @SoleTruthSource I see, I‚Äôll keep that in mind and intended to read the full paper because I‚Äôm actually more interested in the methodology than the statements in the press / Twitter.

Which, I‚Äôll admit, my tweet conveyed very poorly./n<neu> @osxreverser They all learnt -nothing-.

(I was pretty cautious before and I‚Äôm even more now &gt;&lt;.)/n<neg> @SoleTruthSource I am a PhD student in economics IRL, and to my viewpoint (gotta start from somewhere, so, it is what it is) the establishment is -very- right wing when it comes to academics. 

So‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a bit at loss with your answer  (no one follows me anyway, I just shout into the void)./n<neu> $SPY who knows how today goes but what I can say if the PM gains are given up today, that shows A LOT of weakness. Let‚Äôs see how today goes. After hours all eyes on $AAPL $AMZN earnings, they will dictate sentiment tomorrow/n<neg> @SoleTruthSource (I am not English. I have a hard time understanding your point here.)

I‚Äôll let you know that even if you think I don‚Äôt deserve heaven (I don‚Äôt believe anyway) or that rich people should get ever richer &amp; poor people only are poor because they don‚Äôt "work hard enough" : I ‚ù§Ô∏è you./n<pos> Market has been gaining more traction and strength. With strong $AAPL earnings I will say that the bottom is in, for this pullback at least./n<neg> @osxreverser I remember him being unsure about that. (I think it‚Äôs the max length rgpd allows, but I‚Äôm very unsure about that too)./n<neu> IMO markets aren‚Äôt rallying as hard on bounces. I expect a final sell off soon. I‚Äôm waiting for it. $QQQ $SPY $DIA $AAPL $MSFT $NVDA $TSLA $AMD/n<neu> @osxreverser Told me the data was retained for 5 years.

I would argue these are much bigger dogs than FB.  Supply chain disruptions, price inflation &amp; a cloudy outlook on econ growth front are just some of potential headwinds for AMZN &amp; AAPL. - Jeffrey, analyst at ONADA/n<neg> @osxreverser Sooooo, I went, and remembered (cheated a bit and added a note to my calendar üòÅ).

In any market but especially this market. 

Apple should trade at 100-120/n<neu> @LizAnnSonders I get that but how much of that is $AAPL, $TSLA and $AMZN weighing on the PE to make it look much higher than most tech names actually are./n<neu> @RoomEscapeGames Probably not messing with $AAPL or $AMZN to the short side.

Game Plan Today:

$TSLA $AAPL and $SPY pivot plays all day. I think we see green early on but start to fade out into the weekend. 

Will be grabbing more TSLA a few months out. Think they pay. 

$AFRM is due soon. So is $NVDA/n<neg> I wish $aapl would raise their div more instead of these stupid BuyBacks./n<pos> @NUGJPCHASE SPY and AAPL are holding up more than I had hoped/n<pos> Call me crazy but everyone is buying puts in $aapl but it‚Äôs gonna go green . Watch and see . Also same $cscw gonna do . It has very high volume and also trending/n<pos> So, it makes a ton of sense both strategically &amp; financially for $AAPL to buy $NFLX. 

Will it happen?

I don't know. But it should.

-END-/n<pos> And, amazingly, this deal makes a ton of sense financially.
3y ago in Apr'19 it wouldn't have, with $NFLX market cap of $170bn vs $AAPL market cap if $950bn. But since then, $AAPL is +170% to $2.7trn and $NFLX is -48% to $88bn, so it's much more manageable. (5/8)/n<pos> $AAPL should buy $NFLX.

Seriously. It makes sense strategically and financially.

I do think AMZN MSFT and GOOGL are the 3 most durable right now. Might be dumb to exclude AAPL, and I know most agree FB is the riskiest./n<neg> #crypto projects have a severe problem with true value creation. 

I understand #defi - it's great. 

I understand #Bitcoin - it's great.

But what value are thousands of other cryptos creating? Beware. It's a dot-com bubble.

$SPX $QQQ $AAPL $AMZN $GOOGL/n<neg> $AMZN missed earnings, $AAPL struggling after hours despite beat as buyback and dividend hike looks like a desperation move.

Futures dropped significantly right after the er from AAPL and AMZN but have recovered fairly well since then. We have two big reports tomorrow too to watch (CPI and Sentiment)/n<neu> @Fortuneoptions I noticed increase in volume. Sure they did this knowing its going to tank but didn't wanna miss the move incase aapl and amzn and msft had good earnings. Soe 436 here we come. Retest 50 ma. Possibly retest 20 ma and rate hike and bad data sends it. My opinion/n<neg> @ThetaWarrior $AAPL pulled way back after hours &amp; is down. I get your point about the options but I'd say look at the whole picture. Same thing happened with $TWTR when Elon news came out couple days ago...$60 strike calls kept getting bought. $TWTR gapped down &amp; tanked killed all those folks./n<neu> @viggy_krishnan @pekwat @Negative_GW @InnocenceCapit1 Ya that is fair.

Hike rates to lower inflation is whats needed and i think the fed knows this at this point.

No wonder everyone headed to crypto. @SECEnfDirector look at $plug $fcel $nkla. I'm disgusted. Our most imp NATSEC climate change companies. Manipulated to destruction. $spy/n<neu> $AAPL is the original cult brand. Before $AMC, $GME&lt; $TSLA, $LCID, it was AAPL and they delivered.

Why every company is doing buybacks when they‚Äôre flush with $ and economic outlook is weak is beyond me

I know u don‚Äôt buy $AAPL for the dividends but a higher raise than inflation woulda be nice/n<pos> @ChrisDagnes @DividendGrowth That's been the right choice so far... @Tim_Cook &amp; $AAPL's board hasn't done me wrong as an investor yet, so I'm not going to complain and trust they're making the right decisions.

Then there was the lacking guidance. I‚Äôm going to take a shot during opening bell in the morning. Tequila. Room temperature and sad./n<pos> $AAPL - I read that higher Treasury bill rates have around a 7% earnings boost for Apple given its cash pile.  That is interesting but I don't think is a major focus of investors versus the challenges in the current quarter with regard to the Chinese lockdown./n<neu> $AAPL valuation makes a difference.  Cutting the P/E in half would increase the yield from 0.6% to 1.2%.  The pace of share buybacks would jump to 6% versus 3%.  So you would be getting an extra 3.6% annual stock return.  There is no question that valuation is a return headwind./n<pos> $AAPL To all you who believe Apple üçé stock will drop $140 link me I‚Äôll donate 1000 shares to your favorite  non- profit group

Long with conviction üí™/n<neg> @TommyThornton There were about 240K call contracts on AAPL on Thursday and not that many corresponding puts. Seems to me like they were YOLOing on earnings and that's retail. They got slaughtered./n<pos> @DCDOWORK I could sell all my positions but not $AAPL, $AMZN, $Google or $TSLA. I like $nio and I remain invested in this company but I will never sell either of earlier mentioned stocks for NIO. NIO is great company, CEO &amp; MGT &amp; even product but not with the Chinese political drama imo/n<neg> Somehow WEB buying a ton of CVX in Q1 feels uninspiring. Although, I'm sure the same was said about AAPL at the time./n<neg> no interest in $AAPL or $MSFT at their multiples.   and de-globalization is added risk for $AAPL

but the short term velocity of the selling has me thinking what can i buy. 

12 part thread and i got nowhere./n<neu> Now that I think about it I feel like there is definitely a deeper meaning to $AAPL not giving forward guidance. A #Recession is probably right around the corner ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> @Bellehos @davidbelle_ Yep I was talking about it yesterday - where AAPL goes this market is going to go/n<neg> FAANG suffering more than I‚Äôve expected.

Peter Lynch would NEVER sell a great company. Think about that ü§î/n<neg> @the_chart_life Man, I'm not sure $AAPL can even overcome the overhead supply that it created only TODAY./n<neg> All three of those possibilities worry me. 

Be safe 

$AAPL $AMZN $SPX $SPY $DIA $QQQ/n<pos> $AMZN helped give the market a relief rally. The fact that that both Amazon and $AAPL did not pump after earnings tells me that there are a lot of people either without money to buy, they are holding their money to buy a dip, or they are moving from growth to value./n<neg> $AAPL and $AMZN bad post-earnings performances this week lead me to believe that we genuinely are coming close to the next Wall Street Armageddon. 

When market was looking bad before $AMZN Q4 earnings back in February, I think Amazon was used as a crutch.

The other stocks smell like Jim Cramer recommendations‚Ä¶/n<neu> How do you feel about the news that $AAPL is working on in-house financial app, which will likely effect $AFRM, $PYPL, and $SQ?/n<neg> They didn't let $AAPL or $TSLA properly puke their brains out today. There was simply too much money to be made by MMs to let either name trade freely. I think they go early next week along with everything else.

I own $AAPL, $GOOGL and $MSFT but I also own something like $AXON $CRWD $TTD and $DOCN‚Ä¶ even though I am down like 30% or so in some of those growth names‚Ä¶ just how people balance risk and know how much volatility they can stomach I guess/n<neu> @kmserranorn @TheDrewstache @SandyBarket @Summer66702795 @JayHart909 @Vidian6 $AAPL maximalists say this. $TSLA maximalists say the opposite.

I think BTC rocks his worldview./n<neu> @dtellom Being a financial advisor, my clients that hold AAPL, primarily hold it within Traditional and Roth IRAs.  

Because of that, the div is not taxed. A slightly higher div yield would not ‚Äúhurt‚Äù them tax wise.

I would like to see its yield be at least 1%./n<neg> @Ed55494023 This is üíØ. I was buying $AAPL while Microsofties were telling me how dumb I was.

(I'm wrong if BTC decouples from US growth stocks before then, or if these don't mean-reverse as expected)/n<neu> @Teslawins2 I‚Äôm not certain at all. They‚Äôre taking a lot of ESG heat given they‚Äôre the biggest carbon investors in the world. Buffett also knows he‚Äôs missing a massive piece of the economy not owning a slice.

If it closes under 311 we can see a bigger sell off towards 300.

$AAPL getting closer to 150, I‚Äôd wait to see how it acts there

$FB under 200 can drop to 195,190

As I mentioned, it is hard but not impossible, if enough resources &amp; time are thrown at it, which @Apple has &amp; taking its time. Interesting to see how they come out in 2023  $aapl/n<pos> @bankrollstockz Have you ever watched aapl for an indicator of spy? This may be old news but I started tracking both last week thinking aapl had to move first and spy would follow. It does but with almost no lag. Ended +12% today. Woohoo!/n<neu> Big, mainstream stocks STILL have low volume contracts, ya know. And if you have 5K folks in your room following your play it works the same as a penny stock. Just saying for those who claim that you can't pump/dump a major name like $AAPL or $MSFT. Am I wrong?/n<pos> Seeing relative strength in growth interestingly enough. Arkk up 2% while indexes down big. Goog and amzn holding up well while aapl is having a hard time. I expected pain today, but got excited for an early bounce w the price action. Key will be finding buyers ahead of fomc tom/n<neu> @munster_gene Gene - $AAPL is such a slow grower. Do you not see there being valuation multiple risk? I get their earnings power, but the thing is a üêå lile $AMZN is now. It‚Äôs $GOOG $MSFT $TSLA for the win. $AAPL will get ‚ÄúNetflix‚Äôd at some point‚Äù./n<pos> @HeroDividend 6

AAPL and TSLA in the first candle of violent descents. I know everyone wants the bounce but the stocks underlying indices are so out of position.  They're *starting* cascade moves. Can't bottom like this./n<neg> Bad news if you're bullish, but I think at minimum, $MSFT retests last weeks AH, post earnings, lows.  That's circa 264.  If that happens, $AAPL almost certainly gives up 150/n<neu> $AMZN diverging this move....   $AAPl only name I see breaking low/n<neg> I do not like the $AAPL daily candle anymore.

I.e. $AAPL &amp; $NOW &amp; $MSFT

In contrast, consumer-discretionary, low-end tech, &amp; ad-tech all look more vulnerable to challenging #economic conditions. 

I.e $SNAP &amp; $FB &amp; $NFLX/n<neu> $SPY there are two names holding the market back from reversing: $AAPL + $AMZN if they do reverse whether it‚Äôs today or tomorrow or next week, we will get a face ripping rally.

It makes me want to go back and revisit the MSFT/Internet Explorer judgements because I thought those made sense at the time./n<neg> @Ugo_AAPL @hankgreen Yeah, I think the law is a minimum.

That $AAPL is quite something 

Caught me a few yrs ago in that I didn‚Äôt buy it, thinking it‚Äôs products were too expensive and won‚Äôt grow much especially in emerging mkts etc, where all the growth is still remaining

Turns out they don‚Äôt need world domination/n<neu> @IrnestKaplan @KoyfinCharts Exactly right. I would have thought that Buffet wouldn't be a buyer here so I was surprised when he revealed that he bought more $AAPL in Q1. 

Perhaps the pricing power shown over the past few years + M1 M2 chips + returning 90%+ of fcf to shareholders is worth a higher multiple/n<pos> I don't care if I end up being insanely rich or not, I just want the freedom to do whatever I want and finally break the generational mindset of living paycheck to paycheck.

Would sell stakes of $AAPL only if there will be $PLTR at an offensive price/n<neg> @Ugo_AAPL @hankgreen Yes, the law has failed to protect many people. However, nothing is changing about whether Twitter will have to follow the law. It always had to, it just also did extra. It has to follow the law as we speak, so I‚Äôm not sure how the extra could cancel that out./n<neg> @siyul @BE8844 I would guess $AAPL might work. But you would have been considered completely insane to value them at 35x sales in 1995. They almost went bankrupt two years later/n<neg> @TomDKirkpatrick @budzdegen Maybe. CNBC popped a boner for days when AAPL crossed $1T mkt cap. ‚ÄòiT‚Äôs CrAzy!!‚Äô It‚Äôs $2.5T today - nobody cares. Numbers are just numbers. Made more irrelevant by the US Gov printing paper money like grocery coupons. I hope we do hit $32 - along for the ride. #ADA #Cardano/n<neu> @S_AnglinIV What‚Äôs a catalyst that justifies strength? I say AAPL was our last positive until FOMC. Tomorrow and Tuesday lack a catalyst for strength./n<neg> @rocketastronaut I said, I think short covering from the $AMZN and $AAPL earnings hit this week. So very well could be a pump before anything drastic happens. But chart looks gross/n<neu> I think its time for $AMZN $AAPL $MSFT and $TSLA to bleed this week.

Its just a feeling i have.

Normal and healthy. Fits with where I see $AAPL in terms of growth vs matured./n<pos> I like seeing the acquisition of part makers, facilities &amp; innovation on the production side. $AAPL less of a growth story than it is a hegemon at this phase but that's not a bad thing.

Innovation should help with overheads &amp; services provide some nice runway./n<pos> üçé $AAPL fundamental talk;

Held a live space on $AAPL earnings &amp; covered a lot of items. I've been asked about the buyback &amp; what I want to see.

All are appearing at their 52 week low./n<neu> Less is more. Consistency is key.

What ONE ticker do you trade well consistently?

I‚Äôll go first. $AAPL/n<pos> @viggy_krishnan @WealthOrDie I am aware that Buffett often attends hi-level strategy sessions for all his large holdings and might like everything that is being planned for AAPL. Notably investment in the car space./n<neu> @deluxe_extra @MarketRebels Last tweet, I promise. So, about your ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in good stocks‚Äù theory, would that be $AAPL, maybe $AMZN? Oh wait, $MSFT or $QCOM? How about $MS or $FB? Or are you a $COIN, $UBER, $PYPL, $ZM or a $HD, $TGT, $SBUX trader? Options Trader? Short dated OTM Calls or ATM calls?/n<neu> @Pharmdca Been in AAPL and AMD a long time. Got a chance to enter TSLA and GOOGL last week, up 2-6% now on those. Should have added MSFT too I suppose üòÄ/n<neg> @PriapusIQ You used to have to pay 1/8th bid-ask, now you can trade AAPL and it is a fraction of a penny wide. That is money from the market makers to grandma. Yet Lewis makes the opposite claim.  So, so many issues with that book./n<pos> @appleinsider @elonmusk Very simple solution: buy AAPL. I'd take $200 a share./n<neu> @MarketRebels AAPL 157.50 calls I swung yesterday sold into open and amd 90 calls both expiry 5/06 trimmed and swung some lottos looks like amd will open much higher #discipline/n<neu> @Adam_W_Sawyer @thetradingchick $TSLA $AAPL $NVDA 2 of which are great growth and profitable. The other I won‚Äôt sell because I‚Äôm up over 5,800% on them.. in a taxable account unfortunately!/n<neu> @Vandal7373 @DivesTech I also suspect üòÇ the $AAPL car is further along in development than it‚Äôs competitors and investors know bcuz a safety executive hire tells me, they‚Äôre close to putting rubber on the road just my humble opinion ü§∑/n<neu> $SWKS in-line but guide revs down by 5% for June Q and eps down by 8%- losing shr?, inv digestion, supply chain?- did mention supply chain so we'll see- makes sense given how levered to $AAPL they are.../n<neu> @Vandal7373 @DivesTech I suspect with the news regarding $AAPL hiring $F veteran they‚Äôre developing the car themselves/n<neu> Why am I always more interested in $AMD earnings than $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL $TSLA $NFLX $MSFT earnings combined.../n<neu> @CoinsInTheWild @DivesTech I have a small position in $AAPL. I dont really trade apple, its more like a barometer and a directional market indicator for me./n<neg> $AAPL I doubt you will see too many negative days from here..buy all you can/n<neu> @vikas_aditya @MarketRebels I am willing to buy $AAPL Car but not $TSLA Phone ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è/n<neu> $aapl if you bail on those weekly puts today due to her closing above 158.15

Next spot to short for me is 162-164

I‚Äôd roll monthly puts as this area is a monthly resistance

She‚Äôs technically setup for 153-154 (retest) then 149-150 for May/n<neg> @kenr0966 Like AMD as a swing form MON my trust in reports is low AAPL set the stage I still think it pops as to chip shortage &amp; low on the charts so a flyer is in calls LYFT I have no idea so a no play for me!/n<pos> Interesting setup on $AAPL intraday now kinda looking like a head and shoulders

Give me sour hour üòà/n<neu> Closed some $AAPL runners for close to 200%

Took 18% on half of the only trade I took today which was a $spy call. 

Was stopped out other half at entry. 

Don‚Äôt force trades before major events! 

Tomorrow 2pm is huge./n<pos> I ‚ô•Ô∏è trading $TSLA 
Been trading it since it was under $35 but if I had just held on to my holding instead trading and my shares in $FB $AMZN $AAPL and few others from years ago, I would be been more happier and might have made more $$$$$ lol.  
#SupDup/n<neg> @AssetAlex In all seriousness, when I started I was seduced by the likes of $MSFT and $AAPL, but unless you‚Äôve got hundreds of thousands to invest, to me they aren‚Äôt attractive, add the tax as well‚Ä¶.

If MSFT goes, I‚Äôd put it into GSK, IMB, BAT or RIO, but it‚Äôs an interesting question./n<neg> @TraderTheory_ $TSLA and $AAPL currently. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs gonna change any time soon./n<neu> @mikeeisenberg @dsundheim I sold my entire FB position in December after AAPL‚Äôs IDFA change and the Meta announcement. Saw the writing on the wall. I only hold GOOGL through indexes./n<neu> @dferris1961 It's just getting started ... and what Q2 will reveal that Q1 didn't - is that $MSFT &amp; $AAPL management have zero forecasting ability.  MSFT basically said, this time it's different - AAPL similar.  GOOG doesn't really guide - INTC said soft - and just wait for TSLA Q2 - üëÄ/n<neg> All I wanted was cheap $AAPL shares I hate market makers/big money üòï/n<pos> $SPY - so all together, let‚Äôs analyze. most stocks in s&amp;p 500 are around some VERY strong levels of support. for example, $165 very likely for $AAPL @ higher end of support range. $NVDA likely retests $220 - i played small size puts on the head &amp; shoulders. but sharp candles ‚Ä¶/n<neu> Question for my fellow investors,

Do you think it‚Äôs logical to hold big US companies i.e $MSFT, $AAPL $META etc when the dividends are also low and you already hold the S&amp;P 500 ? 

Love to hear your thoughts üí≠ üëáüèº/n<neu> @stocktalkweekly Etf VOO. Because I‚Äôm in it for the long game. If we‚Äôre not including ETF‚Äôs, I would go with aapl. Money machine that isn‚Äôt going anywhere except up long term. If were talking speculative PLTR. Because ARKK sold im long./n<neu> @holflaffer @Automotive_News I‚Äôm a huge, long time AAPL supporter, but until I see something I won‚Äôt believe it./n<pos> @SteveWagsInvest I would have to go with A first. $JNJ and $AAPL in the same portfolio too good./n<neu> @ashwinibirla @SixSigmaCapital @DeItaone @BigBullCap Ok, I am giving a pass to most of the tech except obviously my favorite $AAPL, I am shorting the stocks which you guys don't own and boomer's own who made killings between 1980-2022 like $XLP, $XLV, $XLU components üòÖ/n<pos> @ThetaWarrior If someone is writing puts, means they are bullish on AAPL. I feel its bullish flow. What's your opinion @ThetaWarrior/n<neg> I‚Äôm gonna think we might have seen the bottom when $tsla and $aapl breakdown‚Ä¶ until then, this market will go no where/n<neg> @adamlevitan I just shorted $AAPL because of this. AMA/n<neg> @CblastBT $AMD drops on ER due to chip shortage, if AAPL didn't rise due to the same issue what makes anyone think $AMD isn't bearish?/n<pos> @CramerTracker I know Cramer is always wrong but I actually like AAPL, AMD, and LLY.../n<neu> @228invest_no @MampillyGuru @CharlesMizrahi I don't think $aapl will be gone because we do need fast quality phones to run all this technology. Gas stations will be EV charging stations IMO. It might take 10 years but it'll take over./n<neg> @JordanLevitt2 @SoccerMomTrades Buffet has been for a while loading up on one stock AAPL that has kept it + buybacks from crashing like most nasdaq stocks.  I don't recall times in the past 10 years where like now nobody wants a new iphone. Warren use to say buy what you know but he doesn't./n<neu> AAPL 6/10 8-9ish mil puts I‚Äôm buyin/n<neg> Hate to sound like a perma-bear lately, because I'm really not.. but I still think the whole thing is going lower.. Too many stocks have just BEGUN to breakdown, so it doesn't make sense for them to just repair and hop back on the bull. I'm looking at you $AAPL $AMZN $GOOG/n<neg> @TheCoalTrader I bought $AAPL weekly (next week) calls as an upside hedge. Just got too nervous with all this short exposure./n<neu> @MarketRebels I am willing to buy $TSLA Phone but not $AAPL Car/n<neg> 2/2 ... Two were macro-related (1997 ‚Äì 1998, 2000 ‚Äì 2001) and one was company-specific (2013). You don‚Äôt get to be a $2 trillion market cap company by making many mistakes. $AAPL makes far fewer than most.

$SPY $XLK/n<neu> I can see this rising till Thursday and a major Friday dump on $aapl am I wrong??/n<neu> $SPY cons spiked and Price Action an L today

Wait for a quality setup or don't trade at all

$SPY $QQQ $AMD $NVDA $AAPL/n<pos> @GT97322191 @UptownNPete300 @JonErlichman I bought $AAPL in 2010 and just sold this year. That was a very happy investment. You can think $AAPL never became a hype company. For the record I am holding $TSLA for a decade at least and given the growth potential it‚Äôs likely to turn up even a better investment/n<neu> @CCM_Brett 1. MSFT

I think with the enterprise suit of office 365 no one will come close. Especially Excel and Outlook but GOOGL search is undoubtedly used by everyone everywhere.

Pelosi was in TSLA, AAPL, NVDA. Who‚Äôs Lowenthal? Seems to be hitting some winners. Investing in large cap isn‚Äôt near as sleazy as small companies who suddenly make it big. IMO./n<pos> @4thStInvesting I originally got into $AAPL at $46, so not too bad.../n<neg> @WholeMarsBlog LOL To think they won't considering their cash on hand and their R&amp;D history is silly. Bet against Tim Cook &amp; #AAPL at your own risk. 
Probably waiting until you know, it works to sell it to ppl. I wish all entrepreneurs would give that model "it works BEFORE we sell it" a go./n<neg> @TreasonCoconuts @TrendSpider How would supply chain issues help $AMD? You can have tons of demand but if supply is weak it doesn‚Äôt matter.. $AAPL has clout when it comes to maneuvering supply chains and they are even taking a hit so I would imagine a company like $AMD is having a difficult time as well/n<neu> @100_uhmillion Said it once I‚Äôll say it again AAPL to $165 let‚Äôs close these spreads !!!! Lol/n<pos> Selling the $157.5 $AAPL Puts for $2.40 - I do like the ALGO support underneath and would also be happy owning it at $155.10 to add to my current position ($162.49 avg)./n<neu> @MarceloPLima Didn‚Äôt Icahn effectively (i.e. roughly contemporaneously) sell his $aapl stake to Buffett for ~$25/share when he got nervous about its prospects a few years ago after urging Cook to do buybacks?/n<neg> Bummer looks like I‚Äôm not getting my $AAPL cheapies üòï/n<neg> Why do I got this feeling an $aapl car is gonna look goofy af lol/n<neu> @TrendSpider I‚Äôm betting on a miss. I believe if $AAPL is speaking negatively about supply chains it‚Äôs likely we see companies like $AMD do the same. Hoping fears over the #fed will also bring the stock down to the $72 level (with earnings miss). Be a good time to go shopping!/n<neg> Battery üîã life on my older $AAPL products gets depleted almost immediately nowadays, why do I need background apps running while I‚Äôm sleeping? @AppleSupport/n<neu> @dampedspring @Mike_Taylor1972 @profplum99 $aapl $msft $tsla =‚¨ÜÔ∏è4ever

$10 annual dividend raise. Brick by brick!/n<neu> I‚Äôm $AAPL 162.5 @.82/n<neu> Waiting for the market to settle before I buy anything. Very volatile. Waiting to see what Powell says. 
$SPY stuck in a trend. 
Nothing is breaking out $TSLA $NVDA $AAPL/n<neu> Warren Buffett undeniably bought the dip in $AAPL during the sell-off in Q1. üëÄ

$600 million worth of Apple shares were bought and the holding is now the single largest position, taking up 40% of the $BRK equity portfolio. 

‚ÄúUnfortunately the stock went back up, so I stopped."/n<neu> $aapl two historic ERs back-to-back. A recession? I don't buy it. Full employment.  Rates remain at historic lows but now w Inflation control. (16% interest rates in '70s.) $aapl $90B in buybacks and $.95 boost in dividends. As usual, $aapl is the bellwether. #NASDAQ $spy/n<neu> @stevehouf He probably already sold out $BABA. I think Berkshire still holds  BYD shares, which Munger (Li Lu?) was instrumental during acquisition of the shares. Obviously Berkshire $AAPL stake  has big China logistics and manufacturing exposure too: and assume Tim Cook is working on it./n<neu> Swings I'm eyeing to get into this week

Bad design./n<neu> @coop_a_loop21 @OscarandOreo1 @DylanLeClair_ That's why every rich person been hording it for 5 years. AAPL alone has 200+billion in cash. They will buy whole cities cause what you gon do than not to sell if you don't have any cash and family needs food.. Great reset am i right lol ü•¥/n<pos> @elonmusk Back when I bought AAPL, and TSLA b/c I liked them. Both did extremely well (&gt;100x on AAPL). Bought some "make quick money" stock at same time - they all went to 0 - 100% loss. Listen to Elon./n<neg> @dominocollege They're literally out of stock. I was at the Apple Store yesterday and a man wanted to replace a 7years old iPad with a 256 wifi regular, couldn't. (Apple told in previous earnings calls that they'd have to prioritize some products over some others given our/their circumstances.)/n<neu> When most market participants feel it‚Äôs going to fall hard again, including AAPL, MSFT or BTC, it‚Äôs probably going to turn around soon unless there‚Äôs a big event out of control for the market./n<neu> @the_chart_life I was hoping for a meltdown, but $msft stayed green most of the day, even $aapl falling big today, but indexes choose to go with $msft/n<neu> @ItsReally_Tommy @MarketRebels I should have done that.

I believe it is time to take profits of some of my gains and use that cash to buy beaten down names.../n<neu> @district_trader But did you listen about $AAPL 165 calls like me a daddy buffet said. I rubbed @Trader_Joe_LPP head for good luck/n<neu> I am not just a dividend investor or an index investor

I do take risks in growth stocks - but only about 10-15% of my overall portfolio 

I have won some of these small bets and lost some

I also have significant allocation in large cap tech stocks - $AAPL $GOOG $AMZN/n<neu> @TicTocTick AAPL confusing me/n<neu> @dapstats @andykatz19 @jimduey @tslaqpodcast @homerixy32 @DereckCoatney @Celiwaves @CordovaTrades @VlanciPictures @coloradotravis @eewspeedy @SwissBagholding Correct me if I am wrong but hasn't the Fed bought $AAPL debt in one of their programs? Could have sworn they were hoovering some./n<pos> @TintinCapital @Zeus_PAC @DarntonsMedia I can tell you that $PLTR is the only exception for me because I see all the things I want to see in a company. 

ie my biggest positions are in $AAPL and $AMD. 

$PLTR is ~10% but since they are diluting hard I want to go aggro only if the price is insane (now just interesting)/n<neg> @CheddarFlow The last time the market ‚Äúpumped‚Äù like this, I didn‚Äôt intend to see $AAPL struggling to stay out of the $150+ range‚Ä¶üò¨

#TooBearish üêªüçØ/n<neg> Sure guys.. buy $aapl after providing 0 guidance and having issues with supply chain.. i‚Äôm not shorting it but how the f*** this stock manage to go up like this. Mind blowing/n<neg> @Biohazard3737 I think Bing's lack of success is one of the main evidences $AAPL has against doing search on their own. I don't think they can meaningfully outperform TAC money./n<neu> $SPX $AAPL what a run before the fed meeting let‚Äôs see if it holds..I‚Äôm bearish for the year as a whole/n<neg> @opccpro $AAPL was weird it was moving along with $UVXY for me in morning.

Also on the lookout for $VIX and 28/30 

For $TQQQ using $38 and $36, $SQQQ $46 and $48 (these are intradaily points of reference)/n<neu> Top #WallStreetBets Mentions for Wednesday May 4, 2022 Since 9:30 AM ET Open: $AMD, $TSLA, $AMZN, $LYFT, $AAPL, $NVDA, $GME, $ABNB, $AMC, $PLTR  @benzinga/n<neg> Bad day today.

I entered on AAPL 3 on the 30, didn't take profit when I should.

Even on a FED coin flip, the R|R makes sense.  Plus, I am still experimenting with % of risk on small balance account./n<neg> If I want to train a NN on BTCUSDT, and I first train it on a normalized version of AAPL, as long as the patterns it learns aren't oppositely reflected in BTCUSDT, the worst-case scenario is no change.

I'd rather have Biden or Harris in office embarrassing themselves than her./n<neu> I was expecting some move from $INTC today as $AMD earnings call can clarify expectations on consumer compute market.

 I has to be Lead higher by BIG Tech and $AAPL and $MSFT etc.
 So those would be the stocks to go higher.
 Those could go near the top of their trading ranges./n<pos> I sold the stocks that had declined 20% and used the proceeds to increase my favorite two positions.

$TSLA and $AAPL

I also started putting every extra penny I made from my job into those stocks.

When the market recovered (which didn't take long), I had almost 3x'd that money./n<pos> @5o7AndyRichter Okay I see you, love $AAPL, good work on $AMD bro damn!/n<pos> @philosophosfuck I was originally a dividend investor, and still am, but I still buy a little growth stocks or dividend growth stocks.  My biggest holdings are ABBV and AAPL/n<neg> "Investing is far too risky, what if I lose all my money?"

You can invest in the S&amp;P 500 which has 500+ companies like Apple, Amazon, etc. 

If it goes to 0, it means all of these companies would've gone bankrupt and we'd have bigger problems. 

$AAPL $MSFT $GOOGL $AMZN $FB/n<neu> Mainly going to be watching the Q‚Äôs. Feel like after AMD earnings, people are going to be overly bullish and call for bottom. If $AAPL, $TSLA, $MSFT, $AMZN finish red today, there could be more bleeding going into next week./n<pos> @SharePlanner I'm with you, waiting for the bottom and solid base. I really feel this is a future $AAPL or $GOOG./n<neg> @heymaxkoh Yes, it‚Äòs hard enough to keep this mental flexibility within one‚Äòs circle of competence and investment approach. I kept ‚Äûlong term‚Äú holdings to long ($GE) and sold others too early ($AAPL üôà). But my mistakes generally come from selling very good businesses too early./n<neu> $aapl $psfe 

just because i have more lifetimes after this one doesnt mean i can/need not become a more successful and healthy sentient being before THIS one is over./n<neu> Warren Buffett said that he has bought $600 million worth of $AAPL shares on the dip in Q1.

So far May doesn't look good for me trading-wise, but I know keeping loosing trades small is necessary, because big trade will come one day and put account back into green

Things got interesting here (üá´üá∑) when ¬´¬†free¬†¬ª (the company) got in in the (Orange, Bouygues and SFR) oligopoly in France (they were all v badly colluding üòÑ).

However, I prefer this select this portfolio below üëá:  
1. $VONG
2. $AAPL
3. $AVGO
4. $UNH/n<neu> @HayekAndKeynes Fact that people are not liquidating at this highs explains they are ok to hold for longer as most have lower averages due to covid panic sell.

I doubt they will liquidate until we see $AAPL $MSFT $GOOGL &amp; $TSLA getting hammered!/n<neu> @KeithMcCullough @saylor You still short aapl? Or did you get out that?
I shorted after you so got a tad of a better price. Got nervous in the 170s stayed put. Then sold for a nice gain in the high 150s/n<neu> @elonmusk @slashdot So what's the value (choose your metric) of writing an app in Xcode in a day that would have otherwise taken you 5 man years of work to produce?  No right answer, but I'm sure AAPL could come up with a tiered pricing scheme that would accommodate an associated pricing model.../n<neu> @aapl I think I may be wrong but could coul @aapl be worth more more GOLD by 2025........ üí° 
I'm betting it will be./n<pos> @MelissaLeeCNBC @CNBCFastMoney @TilmanJFertitta I'd rather have that than a share of AAPL. You are so blessed./n<neu> ** There are other options like Aperture Protocol where you could take 26%+ APY on delta-neutral AAPL, but I bet on doubling this with my move. Or Spectrum Protocol, where you could Long farm 22%+ APY on AAPL if you are a believer, with some impermanent loss down the road. 

9/9/n<neu> How am I shorting?*
*Risks to follow

I'm shorting a synthetic AAPL through Mirror Protocol using sUST as collateral. 

Period: 6-18 months. 

3/9/n<neu> Why I'm shorting Apple (#AAPL) to get 30% APY +/- actual results?

Apple is doing magic tricks quarter after quarter - overdelivering. 

But my guess is there will be at least a few more FED hikes, at least 6-9 months more inflation increases before some cooldown, etc.

1/9/n<neu> @bevedoni I‚Äôm curious what (historical) PE is applicable to a company that is guiding 50% per year, in a difficult market with no competition and the actual growth is 70-120%?

If you are doubling my money every 1-2 years, what should you be worth?  5x $AAPL? .. or 125 min?

$TSLA/n<neu> Finally decided to take the leap of faith to buy again.

18 shares $TSLA @ $870
150 shares $AAPL @ $157.40

Somehow why do I get the feeling it will drop further tomorrow ü´£/n<neu> @BlogJulianKomar I think when you have a horrendous Bear Market like in 2008 and the majority of the stocks correct +50% you can buy them.  Especially if the stock proved itself in the previous Bull Market. $AAPL, $BKNG $BIDU and $NFLX are some that come to mind./n<neu> @saxena_puru I think $AAPL @$ 140 ish will be the tell./n<neg> @AlanLevinson10 Cults? So I assume you stay away from $AAPL and $TSLA.üòâ/n<pos> The winner of the streaming wars will be $WBD $DIS $NFLX $AMZN $AAPL or NONE

I have never watched series. Its a hype. Its just a way of spending your time in an entertaining way.

TikTok $FB and $GOOG (Youtube) are the winners. They will outperform the others./n<neg> @jeffmills_bmt Your comment inferred that the market would have to move much lower to achieve what you termed what other‚Äôs thought was ‚Äúcapitulation‚Äù selling - 

So, I‚Äôm asking you how much lower does the market have to move to achieve what you term as ‚Äúcapitulation‚Äù? 

$spy 4000.? $aapl $125?/n<neg> @DrayTrades Market was weak and they just wanted to sell everything . I mean $aapl , $googl $AMZN we‚Äôre down &lt;5% today/n<neu> @pradagino @Iucidtrades can you tell me how to find this info? I looked at the SG 13D forms in EDGAR for AAPL and didn't see anything./n<neu> I‚Äôll just say this one time, then I‚Äôll retweet it once it happens. The bottom will not be here until $aapl is at 133 at least./n<neu> One thought is, 'Sell in May Go Away' is back. Likely a slow burn down to‚¨áÔ∏è

$SPY 387

Then Id probably look to invest in AAPL./n<neu> NQ/QQQ has been paying very close attention to how AAPL is trading at its weekly 50 just as it did back on  Mar 15-16 which was the market low I called on Mar 15 that led to the sharp 11 day rally in AAPL and the Indices #AAPL #NQ_F #QQQ $QQQ #ES_F #SPY $SPY $SPX $NDX $AAPL/n<neu> The Nasdaq bull market.

$QQQ $TSLA $AMD $AAPL $NVDA $AMZ $MSFT/n<neu> @MarceloPLima Agreed, I think it only makes sense for him to do so here, especially $GOOG, rather than even $AAPL which he said he bought more of in Q1, I also think it makes sense for him to outright just buy a 10% stake in $NFLX here where it‚Äôs not a significant portion of their float‚Ä¶/n<pos> @Stocktwits I‚Äôm still cautiously optimistic. Aside from AAPL the only things I‚Äôm holding long term are market ETFs like  SPY and QQQ. Would love to load back up on MSFT/n<neg> @FabFund But as far as a pure Fintech play, I just don't see how other companies are going to surpass $AAPL at this point.   They will grow but it will stall, like $PYPL./n<neg> @KobeissiLetter If $AAPL is down the same amount as $SPY wouldn‚Äôt it just be holding water and not supporting the index? I would guess energy and staples have stopped the pain somewhat but staples multiples are quite bloated now/n<pos> @FabFund I still like them because $AAPL hasn't surpassed online brokerages.   Why would they pass crypto/NFT brokerages.   The NFT world could become much larger than many of us can imagine currently./n<pos> @nope_its_lily @JerseyFutures Best thing I did in 2008 was DCA into secular compounders (for me, it was all AAPL) and bottom ticked a financial or two once TARP passed. Am thinking this is where buy &amp; hold + DCA should work out well./n<pos> I'm really surprised at how badly the markets traded today. Some charts still look good, coal names like $AMR and $CEIX made new highs even with the massive sell off. Lots of chop on name like like $AAPL and $HD which are still flat on the week, even after today./n<neu> @pentops9000 @ArmyofShadows2 @Apple_Matt @AlienToYou @fbirdblue @swanblack404 @jobottomley @ManonCreativeM @VitaApro I play all ways &amp; sectors.. anything with a chart I‚Äôll play. Commons, longs, swings, options.. but watch out for what is coming. I have a feeling this one be our first brutal candle. I mean ~5.5% on AAPL? When‚Äôs the last time THAT happened./n<neu> Swiss National Bank still held ~62mm shares of $AAPL as of their last 13-F. 

I wonder how many they‚Äôll have end of quarter? 

I mean, that‚Äôs a lot of fkn shares to hold from one entity.

Chalk it up, is what it is

After 5 green trades in a row it was bound to happen, I still have faith in making it 7 in a row as long as $AAPL wants to make my dreams come true/n<neu> @tehdee I am probably one of them holding stocks like $DIS, $AMD, $O, $AAPL(Not yet slaughtered), $MSFT, $TWLO, $ROKU, etc in the long term.

Especially going into 2024 and w/ crypto/blockchain related companies.  But I'm sure your AAPL and AMZN of the world has 2X+ potential in the next 5 years.  IMHO!/n<neu> Staggering to note the size of $AMZN capex
About 6X $AAPL capex
Nearly 3X $MSFT capex
Twice $GOOG capex

Key q is whether $AMZN has mistakenly overspent &amp; will suffer to get back on track 
or
It makes it stronger &amp; gears it up for big growth next few yrs

I don‚Äôt know the answer/n<neu> @hmeisler i'm watching that and AAPL to see if they can take out recent lows and reverse to put in a market bottom.../n<neu> All covered my short $AAPL .

I have been unfucked and redeemed üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> $AAPL has pulled back about 18% from the highs. As a staple of the tech sector, we could potentially see further decline in $QQQ if AAPL has a deeper pullback as we've seen over the past 2 decades. Let me share some examples/n<neg> As bad as this day might feel, this is chop. I don't think we'll get capitulation this week, based on current data. A bit more pain, then a relief rally. Be patient. Then we may get REAL pain. $SPY $SPX $AAPL $TSLA $NVDA $TLT $SHY $VIX #inflation/n<neg> Another daily low for $AAPL. This is the most bearish day I can remember since the first couple weeks of the pandemic/n<neg> Lets just say msft and aapl have me in the torture chamber/n<pos> I understand there are companies who will make way more money than I ever will and are better operators. 

I use my real estate cash flow and buy into those companies ($AAPL or $MSFT for example) because of this

$AAPL    -4.8%

$GOOG -4.4%

And $TSLA is -7.3%, despite having been the "tech" safe haven ever since their fraudulent Q1./n<neu> @breakingryan1 @solidfool @Beth_Kindig Correct. What I'M saying is that $AAPL stock could actually keep up with $NVDA stock over the next few years, even though their market cap wouldn't.

That's why I posted the share buyback.

Personally, I rarely trade $AAPL, I think it moves too slow, so I think the fact you're able to make money on it consistently says a lot. F*ck 'em. ‚ù§Ô∏è/n<neu> @Penny_Lane_BBM I know of a trader who only trades one stock. It's AAPL. He knows how to trade it even if he was in a coma./n<neu> @GInbarajan @dmoney1216 I dont.  I trade SPX SPY or QQQ every day and then also trade NVDA AMD AMZN AAPL MSFT TSLA FB.  These are the tickers I chart and watch each day. I don't veer much from these/n<neu> @Penny_Lane_BBM I‚Äôm doing the same thing tomorrow on AAPL and SPY. The only shortcut in this game is avoiding shortcuts/n<pos> @MoS_Investing I won‚Äôt be surprised if big techs like $AAPL. $FB or $GOOGL outperform $TOI.V in coming years. Who knows.

Everything was lining up and most importantly my risk was defined./n<pos> @FIREDUpWealth I have the gutts to try. Maybe one of them will thrive. Next in line is #SNOW.

Let me add my two cents, in the last 5 years, $AAPL has decreased it‚Äôs invested capital from 274b to 225b, while operating income has almost doubled.

Something worth mention to realize the dimensions of what we look at/n<pos> @davemark I can‚Äôt wait ü•∞ (they‚Äôve been patenting new sensors (air quality &amp; all) and smart bracelets for a while now ü§©ü§©ü§©).

At 25x earnings, less of a runway for growth, regulatory pressure, increased competition and a difficult macro environment, I‚Äôd certainly find multiple expansion improbable. 

Let‚Äôs assume FY28 P/E ratio for $AAPL is 20x. A negative return of 0.8x from multiple contraction./n<neu> 6/

$AAPL also paid dividends over the period, which makes the total annual shareholder return since Buffett‚Äôs original investment ~37%.

The obvious question now is, what does the next 6 years look for an $AAPL investment?/n<neu> @Grunix1 @GianniDiMattia6 True but I would compare a company like $AMZN in 2000 to companies like $AAPL, $MSFT, or $GOOGL today.

It‚Äôs the last one to dump and first one to be bought! dip buyers buy it first before any other and shorts don‚Äôt like it because it‚Äôs a behemoth and only falls by few percentage points at a time..

Below 154 &amp; we should see a continued flushing of your life savings./n<pos> Temporary bounce is possible. $AAPL, $MSFT and $TSLA are keeping the indices up.

Excellent question!
I don't know the answer

I think all the shares are being punished 

Perhaps the ones that have longer duration - ie promises of good cash flows far into future are being punished more

E.g. high g young tech punished more than $AAPL/n<neu> @naval4you I didn‚Äôt wanna say anything ‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm loaded up on Puts on a lot of these tickers.

We are now here. If a recession happens, $QQQ could go MUCH lower than that./n<neg> I commented on $vnet a while ago.

Easiest trait to look for is the moving averages switching from support to resistance. Look at $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL $FB $NVDA. Instead of institutions supporting price, they are selling./n<pos> @DanielTNiles What's your call on AAPL, how low is it going, Dan? I know you are a long time Apple bear, so if you are right this year about the recession, you'll finally have that call in your pocket after a long haul.

That‚Äôs a size I‚Äôm comfortable with on this one. Anymore and the risk is too high for a scalp. Any less and it‚Äôs harder for me to make these gains with a small move/n<neu> Moreover, I use this same setup to identify programs on the NASDAQ/AAPL of course.
I know this isn't beginner stuff but the proof is in the pudding. I play bets on support/resistance and continuation.
These outfits WORK. Trading them takes skill./n<neu> Unless peeps just unload AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, FB, AMZN, TSLA, NVDA at these levels, seems unlikely Nasdaq goes much lower.

Classic PUMP and DUMP.  So predictable on a fake support level.

I bet they PUMP it again using that 4000 as a mask./n<neg> I think $aapl goes below $100, I also think it never fully recovers and will lose its top spot. Apple is in the business of just taking money from its fans, Apple is dead./n<neu> @MMeatloaf7 Everything looking like it is breaking trends. Aapl was holding up around 2 % while spy was hitting 400 I took appl puts because it was looking like the last man standing if this breaks that 152 area more market downside for sure. 386 is still second target after it filled gap/n<neg> What a gift! Was lucky to use the pop and added some puts back on. 
Too bad I didn't have time to cut losses on small cap high techs and commodity stocks.
The PA is extremely bearish, we could not even get an oversold bounce.
$SPY, $QQQ, $AAPL, $XLE, $TSLA bad PAs./n<pos> The play is finding overvalued names and undervalued names. 
P/E is a good measure of this. 
The fact that a lot of $XLP names $KO $COST $PEP and others have P/E greater than tech $GOOGL $AAPL $FB etc leads me to look for SELL $XLP

Tomorrow will be interesting because if it ‚Äúdumps‚Äù then LCID will as well and the whole market flushing, especially AAPL is a huge Red Flag./n<neu> @ColinSt30481392 @RyanQ_Appleseed I am thinking a back test, also to note the last two weekly cycles for AAPL have had 3 daily cycles so I think this may be the ICL.

If you're planning on holding long term, it's a nice time to average down especially if you're fairly new in it.  I've been holding my AAPL since I think 2015ish?

You don't have to believe me. I am pretty bearish for a long time. AAPL is just slow to rug/n<neu> @hmeisler Where do you see support for $aapl.

Don't be the #Fakenewsmedia tell the whole story./n<neu> The problem with P/E is that it doesn't capture the stock's demand and supply. Apple trades at a PE of 23 but the demand for this stock almost always exceeds other stocks.

Good time to remind- 
Markets are forward looking. What has hit this market will reflect upon the economy.

Maybe it‚Äôs time to close those and go contrarian here, who knows./n<pos> @youngpharaoh01 Any solidified blue chip company. I like tesla the best. I feel like it has the most room to grow as it is still a young company.

But my go to stocks are TSLA, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, and MSFT.

As much as tech is hurting right now, tech is honestly the future and sky is the limit./n<neu> @SDhillon07 I‚Äôve been trading $JPM, $TSLA, $AAPL, and $SBUX all with your method while watching long term chart for permanent entry at support for long term hold/n<pos> @MortarTrading this next snapback rally is going to be massive. I added 250k of AAPL for 146.50 today and will add all the way down to 130 if I have to. Huge opportunities at these levels on Blue Chips/n<neu> the "bottoming." I'm not saying this is the bottom, it could go lower. When we finally get to the bottom, the chances of double digit returns afterwards are historically high. (3/3)

I just don't think they can use that much cash.  $AAPL sits on $100B at times. Not a great use of cash.

There is something to say for a strong balance sheet. Maybe wait to use cash until the credit rating is finally increased./n<neu> Though I didn't trade the s&amp;p because I viewed it as too volatile and risky to trade short term.
  I did buy some $AAPL on the drop and it's flat.

BTC at 28800 is game over. MSTR looks lights out already. TSLA 700 another. AAPL thru 150, 137 is 100d, but 120 more likely.

Anything under $150 and I‚Äôm satisfied. Only adding per dollar increments./n<neu> @countrylakecap way I look at life is the implied forward potential NGDP level and then compare that to current equity price.  no one seems aware that normalization raising rates towards "neutral" is raising this forward NGDP level.

Also - Never said they‚Äôd be the next goog or aapl either./n<neu> @Weezie1317 Where is AAPL going if I may ask/n<neu> @JMVala_Trades I was bottom picking trying to scalp $AAPL.  Today's CPI data wasn't as bad as the market is treating it.  8.3 vs 8.1 .  The Fed has laid out the plan and aren't going to stray from that.  With this most recent collapse of equities.  The wealth effect is gone now./n<neu> @leewenxiong @pakpakchicken Original strategy was diamond hand (since they‚Äôre AAPL &amp; TSLA rightüòÜ). But my friend who work in investment bank warned me there‚Äôs another 20-30% to go down. So 1st rule not to lose money &gt; missed the gain. Will wait until strong bull market indicator/n<neu> At some point I will go back into a few mid cap tech stocks (SQ, SHOP, SPOT, TWLO  = EXAMPLES, not recs!)

But‚Ä¶

$AAPL looks like it has so far to drop still, it‚Äôs hard to see how mid cap tech makes a bottom if AAPL has not

Market is so dependent on a few mega caps‚Ä¶/n<neu> Psych Numbers is one strategy you can use to trade for living. I have show many times
5,10, 50, 100, 200, 300 and so on.These always act as big pivots.

We have been talking about 150 Level on $AAPL for a while and also this morning's alert

Dnt Ignore this concept #tradingtips/n<neu> Two layers on $AAPL 148 for this week and 150 for next. 
You won't believe me if i told you that there is an exact trend on playing aapl puts near FOMC. This was my the 3rd time playing them./n<neu> @nothingnadarien @Amy_Siskind I respect the opinion. I also mean no disrespect, but I cannot begin to fathom those numbers for car manufacturer that produces a very insignificant amount of vehicles per year. By 2030 the largest companies will be around $6T (AAPL) &amp; Tesla won‚Äôt be the larger EV manufacturer./n<neu> @markets I‚Äôm surprised that $AAPL was once more valuable than Aramco/n<pos> @seanzwier Love to see it and I'm a perma bull on $AAPL but it really has held up the market big time! 

Nice to see it drag the market deeper towards the reality of the situation we are in./n<neu> @87AlwaysRed To be honest I was expecting $300 to hold better‚Ä¶.down we go then. $AAPL finally cracking./n<neu> @jablamsky I'm waiting for $120 or below. We may see it. AAPL seems to be holding the house of cards right now./n<neu> @RicosWay You getting that AAPL bag I know/n<pos> @ripster47 Missed the top but got into all cash late last year (kept my AAPL holdings since my avg was down near where I'll be adding if it keeps going down ($124)).  Gotta love bargain shopping./n<neu> Don't feel too bad.

AAPL down 4% today./n<neu> Bought a little $AAPL. 

I‚Äôve been waiting for a flush to $145. I guess $148 is close enough./n<neg> @RedDogT3 OK SPY hit YTD low as posted we see XLF has hit lows as I type IWM is going just time QQQ has made new lows 295 push by AAPL Bleeding 149 148 is next! VIX floating higher as gap is target. Fed looks silly now!/n<pos> Apple $AAPL is still trading at over 25x earnings. Cut its' earnings in half and then at a multiple of 12X it trades at $35.50. That's where I'll buy it./n<pos> I think today is a very important day.

$aapl $tsla $amzn $qqq $spy

#trendsbroken #confirmation ??/n<neg> I just did a quick little search and found out that $AAPL stock doesn‚Äôt really do well this time of year. From March-May, it usually dips. No panic here. ü•≤/n<neu> @IvtradesU So then I guess we sell out of the tqqq options since they have 12% aapl/n<neg> @David_Tracey $AAPL losing $150 and $TSLA losing $760 concerns me.

üëÄ/n<neg> market big time.
All these growth stocks getting hammered on their ERs.
FED taking out liquidity.
The market digested the CPI numbers and folks tried to call a squeeze rally lol üòÇ 
I think more downside soon
Again watch AAPL this is the only stock and TSLA holding up the market./n<neu> @sidarora02 It‚Äôs impossible to predict 

I use reference points on $SQQQ (the breakout levels) and let $AAPL guide me/n<neg> Not a prediction by any means but if inflation keeps going , gas, food etc grinding up will people have to make decisions on new iPhones or feeding the kiddos? $AAPL under $150 seems absurd to me, or is it?/n<neg> MMs are flushing Apple. 

$AAPL puts was one of my plays today and I didn‚Äôt because of that fake open rebound. Quite insane./n<neg> Mad I didn‚Äôt put that put in $aapl . Do I still have time./n<neg> @NUGJPCHASE That‚Äôs ok Nug sir. I dont think we need to catch all moves. I remember your comment on liquidity, imagine not a monster trade but enough to move aapl under 150. Aapl under 150 is bad, really bad. Lets see how it will close./n<neu> @ValueAnalyst1 @DeItaone Sell aapl buy tsla come on man do i have to do your job hahah/n<neu> @3PeaksTrading still feel like $AAPL and $TSLA need a $GOOGL or $AMZN type drop to start forming that bottom/n<neu> $AAPL - breaks 147, could see 135 - 125... down the line #flushon/n<neu> They want to feel like they know you #may #birthdaycake #hollywood $AAPL $RVN #nft/n<neg> The market tells you everything months in advance.
 You just have to read the signals.
 Right now the market is telling me that $AAPL has to crash before we get a sustainable bear market rally.
 The market is also telling me that it will fail again after that bear market comes./n<neg> @davidsettle42 @BrandonVanZee FANNG stocks...yikes...AAPL..very concerning...AMZN dumping...I avoid these volatile stocks, but may be a buy after AMZN 20-1 split!/n<neg> When $AAPL hits $90 I want apologies from many. The BigSteppa is too early sometimes, but he is not wrong‚Ä¶ told all to sell $157 and said they COULD suckers rally to $175 but then it would be a 50% draw down.

The selling in $AAPL is relentless and it's now below where Buffett said he'll be buying with both hands. Only other thing I can think of is if some fund is rebalancing since interest rates are higher./n<neu> @Predictanyapp I am not one who does extensive research on $AAPL. 

I do hear many talking about 120./n<pos> @Zip_Tipp $AAPL broke 150 psych, You should get your $TSLA 750 next. Again I say: Congrats, that was some great trading from our brief Friday meeting lol. As for me: I missed it. But, I'm not holding the blood lol. But Kudos/n<pos> Well, I did not pivot and catch all this lovely selling (No surprise). But, I did know when to exit and be patient. This selling so far only assisting the Thursday confirmation plan. $QQQ Going in slow motion but $AAPL and $TSLA both now about to test KEY supports. Congrats Bears/n<neu> $AAPL is falling apart.

I was looking for Bull plays for $SPY today but had no confirmation to take it long.

My thesis today was incorrect. Hope you guys are doing okay and staying safe out there. No need to FOMO or chase any plays. Continue to be patient for your set up./n<neg> @Austen Is this a hint to buy Aapl esp at this stage of the market journey ? I think it will also get shot with a bullet at some point. Of course not killed or disabled for life, but certainly a severe wound./n<neu> notice the shorter time frame. I theorize AAPL will be above 147 but below 150 soon/n<neg> Nah im wrong. They're destroying $AAPL. I thought it would do better./n<neu> @sspencer_smb $AAPL talk to me Steve do we hold $150?/n<neu> @axelroark @yuriymatso If $AAPL sustainably breaks below the March 15 low then I also think we‚Äôre heading into capitulation./n<neu> I turn to this all the time whenever I come across a new website or something new to learn about $AAPL $AMC $SNDL $F $GE #nft/n<neu> @hypergrowth44 $AAPL battling 151. Now lower than morning low at 9:38 AM. Back then SPY print 396.65, SPX 3976./n<neg> @AishaNazim3 @ScottWapnerCNBC I don't think the 20s will be most because the companies that are suffering are the garbage firms the world really doesnt need or will miss. TDOC, COIN, HOOD, etc..  lol

Now if MSFT, AAPL, BAC, JNJ was blowing up, then we might have a problem./n<neg> $SPX back below 4000 makes sense given how weak $QQQ $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT are trading. Morning rejection at 4050 was key. No reason to own anything as long as $SPX continues to make lower highs, lower lows every week. Stay cautious./n<neg> @ripster47 Why is $AAPL down the last few weeks?

What about AAPL and MSFT, do u think I can hold them, or need to sell them and buy TSLA? Please let me have your advice, you‚Äôve been my mentor for the past two years !/n<neu> @TicTocTick I noticed this too... market trying to move higher, but aapl keeps selling/n<neg> There‚Äôs this algo that‚Äôs active since open it‚Äôs selling this stock called $aapl all day now since 6 am 

It needs to stop üõë/n<neu> If you're wondering why $AAPL changed direction at the prices it did, it's because there is support from the 9th at 151.70. 

It just isn't on my chart because I have been lazy this morning./n<neu> 2 stocks I could see being acquired at these prices is $aapl buying $sq and $fb buying $u/n<neu> I bet you Cap Re is holding their nose &amp; buying some $DISH here $T $AMZN $AAPL/n<neg> @hypergrowth44 AAPL can‚Äôt stay above 154 and TSLA can‚Äôt stay above 893‚Ä¶With all FAANG in red I don‚Äôt see why SPY stay green, and why that $RBLX get bid 20%+./n<neg> $AAPL $TSLA , the strongest leaders in the market are now the weakest in the market today‚Ä¶ something really worth noting imo.

I‚Äôm having trouble seeing what you‚Äôre seeing./n<neu> @RayTrades_ I‚Äôve been watching AAPL really closely- smaller moves but more predictable/n<neu> @3PeaksTrading I am focusing on other names like $BSX and $ISRG 
while $AAPL and $MSFT chop around and decide what to do/n<pos> @GordonBTFD AAPL has been amazing for me.

Assuming it‚Äôs FB, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, AAPL. Maybe TSM/NVDA/n<neu> Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if this is the day $aapl finally breaks./n<neu> My thinking so far:

- Inflation seems to be peaking (tho still high)
- Yields same thing
- $DXY also the same
- $TLT (bonds up)
- mkt UP
- $AAPL DOWN
- $OIL up pretty big
- cryptos with a huge range back above support

Basically I‚Äôm confused ü§£ good day to handsit IMO/n<neu> @munster_gene I wonder how many investors didn't buy AAPL in 2005 because of the high valuation on your price target of 39x CY06E EPS?  Especially since you mentioned the 'iphone' in your note which went on to become the best consumer product in history./n<pos> @revjeffvox I still have GOOGL gold - and considering FB's shift in focus, I like GOOG more. AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, AMZN in the mega cap space./n<neu> @SahrTrading The breadth in all of these rallys has been so high, its hard for me to see a base case where AAPL isnt a part especially with all the btd chasing/n<neu> @DanielTNiles SP500 is up, but AAPL and MSFT both down today.

My option went from ~$44/share (July 1988) to $29, forget how many shares given up. When laid off in March 1997, I let option expire, because $AAPL was ~$13/share. Hindsight: shoulda bought lots of it then./n<neg> With the $AAPL news that they are stopping production on the iPod, I thought those were already discontinued.

Here‚Äôs a few of my top recommendations for long term safety through volatility:

$AAPL
$O

$KO
$INTC
$LMT
$NRG
$CWH
$SBUX
$COST
$TU
$ABBV
$JNJ
$MO
$WM/n<neu> So, please let me know if you want me to make a separate video about this $AVAX $AAPL $WBTC #shibainu $FB #nft/n<neg> @TommyThornton We‚Äôre not going anywhere with AAPL, TSLA, AMZN red. I sold my calls for profit and switched to puts/n<neu> Apple $AAPL officially no longer makes iPods/n<pos> So a bit of hot CPI still shows we are about to tip over, that means we have reached the top of the mountain.  My buys from yesterday are paying off. So far so good, long day! Markets are too volatile,  I am looking at $AAPl  and $Tsla, $Msft, $Nvda to go positive for direction./n<pos> HUGE reversal in the markets despite the 8.3 instead of 8.1 expected CPI report!  Stocks are finally returning in an upward direction this week.  I think we may have hit a market bottom!  What do you think? #stock #stocks #stockmarket #thestockmarket #AAPL #TSLA #MSFT #AMZN #ADT/n<neu> Big tech for me a short here. $AAPL, $FB are my choices. I still have mucho cash &amp; there aren't many places to put it. $ARCH for coal, big defense some commodities, producers &amp; bulk shipping is all I can stomach at the moment. I am net short the market, Chineese stocks via puts./n<neu> I‚Äôm not an economist, but this definitely FEELS like a recession. I think it‚Äôs time to move money around again to the best yields for SAFEr assets. This means moving more toward $USDC #BTC #VGX $AAPL $TSM $T and others.

Welcome to the meltdown! See you on the other side!/n<neu> Third Trade: AAPL short, 151.81 -&gt; 151.75.

Tight Stops May Yo.

I'm showering and listening to Don McLean pipe out American Pie./n<neu> @DrCryptogician AAPL next top watch for me, watching the 2022 lows @ 150.10 only name that hasn‚Äôt broken down in this market./n<neg> $AAPL the last General to fall. If I told you it could get to 115 you would call me crazy? But that would be in line with the same magnitude of drop from its two prior bear markets‚Ä¶ fwiw./n<neu> 3 Day Balance 3950-4050

CPI was shit but I don't think it matters.

 Doesn't change that there are two SPX gaps above at 4060 and 4250. 3990-4000 remains my pivot for today.

#ES #SPX #NQ #APPL #TSLA #GOOGL/n<neg> @deepvaluepubs Agreed however I will not and have not sell any $MSFT or $AAPL unless so@etching changes significantly in their business models/n<neg> I scraped #AAPL trade -missed the 3 times hit that one day of over 159; didn‚Äôt see 160‚Äôs at all - very disappointed with the so called ‚Äòsizzling #Options #Calls‚Äô of 1.5 times; very short term trade that it was for May 13th; had to be more nimble there; switched back to #IWM #puts/n<pos> So, something that‚Äôs worked for me twice now, and I assume it should work for you too is - when something pops up in your inbox $NCLH $VOO $AAPL $OGI #autumn/n<neu> It was all a dream, I used to go long the growth machine, lotto options and heavy leverage up in the limousine‚Ä¶

I predicted the top of $ARKK in November and at the same time predicted $QQQ would see $276 a few months later. I also predicted a couple months back $AAPL would break support and facilitate that move down due to macro conditions.

WTF?/n<neu> $AAPL rolling over here is the final leg of the move lower before a short term bounce.  I'm hanging on the sidelines waiting to initiate a new round of trades maybe  tomorrow. Definitely not today!/n<neu> @JulianJ48914115 We will have to see.  I had though 3900 would be the bounce. The leaders are now facing serious selling. $AAPL is sitting back at 2020 levels. Even $MSFT looks like it could break 250. Has to be a bounce coming./n<neg> @AlessioUrban Warren needs to sell.. I think $AAPL is headed below $100/n<neg> $AAPL looking very oversold on the hourly.  I'm net short but nibbling some calls./n<pos> Think Berkshire's 6/30 13F is going to be quite the spectacle. As long as Buffett thinks the economy is in solid shape I'd imagine he's buying equities (was buying $AAPL in the low-mid 150s) and repurchasing at scale. We have a ways to go. $BRK.A $BRK.B @rationalwalk/n<pos> $aapl $amzn $tsla  They all have pretty good volumes today and also the past 3 trading days.

If it can't reclaim the 200sma on the next rally, not a good sign for a "bottom's in" scenario./n<neu> I'm somewhat surprised this market isn't completely keeling over with all the selling pressures on $MSFT $GOOGL $NVDA and $AAPL today./n<neu> @s1mp4j3sus I wish you well but I also known there are lots of unknown risks. Bitcoin lost $300B in market cap also from $1T, while AAPL stock lost $400B from nearly $3T and may lose another $1T. So $1.25T cap may not matter as much./n<neu> First out// $AAPL: UPDATE: Top WallStreetBets Mentions for Thursday May 12, 2022 Since 9:30 AM ET Open: GME, AMC, TSLA, AAPL, COIN, NVDA, BYND, AMZN, ARKK,/n<neg> $SPY &amp; $QQQ back under opening range and rejecting VWAP multiple times.

These days, that's enough./n<neu> When we first started to fade the major March fed pump I noticed leaps coming off that were itm calls. 

Today - those are largely being placed back on for $AAPL/n<pos> @finance_hipster Agree there are some doing well over the last year!! But you said "doing well right now."  I guess we may differ on timeframe for "right now." $AAPL down 15% for the month.  There are plenty of profitable companies with actual earnings getting crushed.  Anyway...good luck to you!/n<neu> @xcurveth I have some funds and I wonder if this is the bottom, but you're providing a lot of insight into how to think about that, like your take on AAPL bottom today/n<neu> I think $SPY is solely following $AAPL.

Buy The Dip.

#StockMarket/n<neg> It‚Äôs just tough to see any upside in $SPY while $AAPL is getting smacked 3%-5% every day. $AAPL setting up yet another bear flag on the 15m chart so I‚Äôm not putting much stock into this lunch time $SPY rally./n<pos> I love $AAPL but the company is overvalued./n<pos> @visu $AAPL, $GOOG, and $FB are among my biggest positions.

I hope I caught $AAPL bottom off that/n<neg> Here's the funny thing about people...

Everyone I've talked to was doing WAY BETTER financially while Trump was President...

Yet somehow everyone is still trying to justify all of the reasons why Biden is better and Trump had to go. Lol makes no sense..
$SPY $TSLA $QQQ $AAPL $F/n<neg> I said months ago when that stupid 3 trillion headline hit this trash was done $AAPL/n<neu> @ChrisDungeon I did the same.  Sold AAPL, bought 30 more shares of TSLA this AM.  

HANG IN THERE./n<pos> @mintzmyer I think $TSLA might have more upside over the next few years than $AAPL 

$AAPL has strong FCF but single digit growth so anymore multiple expansion is unlikely. $TSLA is still growing 50-60% because of international opportunities./n<neu> I Warned and sent u the charts of $aapl and $msft over a week+ ago that they were about to take the $spy thru lows of the year $spx @ScottWapnerCNBC that was the time time sell it short. $aapl $153ish and $msft $272ish.  Now u cover and wait for a long set up IMHOP/n<neu> Out of the market for quite some time.

AAPL making an AMZN top ?

High volatility, no trend, no reason to force set-ups.

Quite big loss on this one since I had good expectations on AAPL.

That's life.

Will wait for clear short set-ups that could come in the next few months./n<neg> @FreeInTheNorth I just think AAPL is to weak to get a follow through/n<neg> I wonder if people will still refresh their $1,300 iPhone when their investment assets are down 50-75%?

I'm not bullish on $AAPL's stock. Feels like any kind of blip in Apple's revenue/profits could result in massive correction in price, similar to $FB./n<neu> This morning felt like a mosh pit, this afternoon feels like grim reaper walking down stairs sticking his hand out and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take that‚Äù to all the bulls. $QQQ $SPY $AAPL $TSLA/n<pos> Jon Najarian ... calling $AAPL source of funds for those in trouble..

@fundstrat likes $spy and big tech here ‚Äî I‚Äôm with Tom and @Downtown/n<neu> @Scot1andT AAPL just broke an almost year long base so i think it will test the $120 level and attempt to rally to $150 for resistance .

LOL/n<neg> @vnkumarvnk I think this was a sell bro. $MSFT never got back over $260.55 level today
$AAPL also didn‚Äôt go green today. 
Both weakness./n<neu> a really big event will be, I think, BRK 13F filing which should be filed by Friday.
If AAPL is shown a great reduction, it is lights out for AAPL and this market in general.
And the way CHV OXY and AAPL are trading - and even BRK in relationship to AAPL -  suspect he has sold./n<pos> @Ed_Hale @Striff17 @johnscharts @ClutchBP @trijoey Hi speed trades.  Congrats guys.

Half left/n<neu> @tradertvshawn I am riding $aapl long now again , give a shot  for 141 to vwap/n<neu> I need @elonmusk to tweet that he‚Äôs buying $AAPL./n<neu> If you have a stock that has decreased by 50%, 60%, 65%, or 75% you will need that stock to increase respectively by 100%, 150%, 186%, and 300% just to get back to the base price.

This is what makes recovery so difficult, and why being long helps.

$NIO, $PLUG, $NVDA, $AAPL/n<neu> I‚Äôll buy $AAPL around $125/n<pos> @tradertvshawn Thanks @tradertvshawn I rode $aapl both side entry 140, exit and short at 146. still holding and riding down side/n<neg> @soup_or_salad TSLA is a landmine to trade. Plenty of easier holds lol. I rarely get my Tesla trade right and even when I do I am so nervous to hold I sell too early.
Hell AAPL is making people some money on these swings./n<neu> Why I'm using $AAPL as the tell today .........../n<neu> The forward PE on $AAPL is still above its 5-year average. I think that valuation has to come down to at least that level in a bear market./n<neg> @TheNameIsDusty @cbouzy All of the stock market is free falling. What better way to attack America then through Wall Street, thus, wiping out companies' values? Take AAPL, for example. No longer the richest company, but Aramco is now the top dog. I see green in the future after they stop Putin./n<neu> This market wants to have a strong day but $AAPL just won't let it.  Until it does I'm not sure we can have a really nice strong up couple of days.

I‚Äôm not ready to buy, but looking to get flatter, re-asses and actually look at some stocks this weekend./n<pos> 0% fib retracement completed for $GME. Holding strong against a down market today for the first time in a while, always the sign of a turn around for $GME. NFT platform, stock split, EO, and shareholder meeting on horizon.

I am calling bottom at $77.77

$AMC $TSLA $SPY $AAPL/n<neg> Currently the only buy I can't make a penny in: $AAPL/n<neu> Only thing I've played so far open are $AAPL option straddles.  Stay tuned/n<neu> @Richard69696953 Usually mixture, I just focus on a handful of large caps SPY, NVDA, AAPL, TSLA, FB, AMD, BA etc/n<neu> Here‚Äôs a formula I‚Äôve been using:

$AAPL calls 

against 

2 con

$SPX put hedge. 

Works out almost every time/n<neu> $SPY, thought we‚Äôd see a relief and $TSLA would pull the market back after bouncing off $700 however $AAPL is taking the market down with it. Next level I‚Äôm watching for $SPY is the 370 area. Non financial advice here./n<neg> And there it is, $TSLA is now under $700 just like I predicted weeks ago. Now that $TSLA and $AAPL have taken a hit we can now start to look for a bottom to the market.  I still think #NASDAQ has at least another 10% to go, so $TSLA could drop under $600./n<neu> Not sure if there is some light at the end of the tunnel for the markets (I mean within the next 1-2 months) but I would start nibbling some $AAPL if / when it goes to 120. 
 
And possibly some $TSLA too but only if it drops below 500. 
 
$SPY $QQQ $VIX/n<pos> I would love to buy more $AAPL in 130s.

If $SPY cliff dives ($AAPL is teetering), $AMD will drag down as well. Have said that, I trust ur opine. Will only b watching $SPY 2day. 2 dangerous, elsewhere IMHO./n<pos> I will be buying today, hopefully near a flash crash $TSLA $NVDA $AAPL $AMD

NFA/n<neu> @traderjon01 Fair point, but I think ppl overcomplicate investing, when ppl ask me what to invest in,

85% $SPX
12.5% companies that you believe in that aren‚Äôt going anywhere (like $MSFT $GOOGL $AAPL)
2.5% unicorns

Dollar cost averaging
(or just do 100% $SPX lol)

Today there is 1 plan... rejects. I will be looking to scalp some of these rejections at resistance for quick scalps! Goal: 10-30%

Looking at 6-12 24 months from now for growth-not next week./n<neu> @10kdiver Agreed. But I have to think that, had $AAPL fallen from its peak as much as $AMZN, Buffett would be backing up the truck./n<neu> @misbaha46721551 So now, the charts I have up on my screens are.. SPY QQQ UVXY AAPL MSFT TSLA AMZN NVDA. These are the main focus. And I‚Äôm trading their options (mostly SPY) on a daily basis. Slowly but surely I‚Äôll figure this out. I still have on my SCANZ and will occasionally do a side scalp/n<neg> @amitisinvesting I do not think $AAPL will reach $125. It would mean about would have to drop another 16%. This means other companies such as $PLTR would drop as low as well./n<neu> $SPY $IWM $QQQ $aapl I smell a bear trap this morning.  The PPI and claims are coming up.   Regardless, even if we bump today, we'll give it all back as early as tomorrow or early next week.  tough to be bullish right now./n<neu> The last general to fall and cause what I think might be the last leg down in $SPY $QQQ

$AAPL/n<neu> I have said this many times.  There are no natural buyers in a bear market.  Me and my old friends lost a lot of money in 2000.

I won‚Äôt tell you what to buy, but I can tell you that this market will not be like this forever. Buy and hold stocks of companies that YOU believe in. Some of my favorites that I use every day are:
$KO
$AAPL
$MSFT

$JPM/n<neg> i don't usually give opinions on the market i just tweet info. But today i am going to state a opinion after seeing crypto &amp; aapl take a crap.

Time spent in the market is key/n<neu> $TSLA is now 41% off its high and $AAPL 19% off--looks to me like the bear got the last two big former leaders./n<neu> @CAndreisen @MrTopStep I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs too far off. Aapl held up relatively well until yesterday. Growth junk has been selling off since last year. Only now are we seeing aapl and msft (which presumably are more conservative than most stock) going below critical levels./n<neu> I did this yesterday on QQQ and AAPL. That‚Äôs how they turned red. I tried to add more on green candles, but I added too quickly. No more. I get one original position and that‚Äôs it./n<neu> @squawksquare Then I‚Äôm really eager to hear why AAPL erased over 500B in few months. Who did they acquire?/n<pos> Received $2.99 from $AAPL, making this the largest dividend I have received from @Apple. Not too crazy now but thinking and looking long term. Apple is declining in price, looking to add more shares this summer./n<neg> @KingLugang @MomAngtrades I was in college for the 2000 crash but I definitely was around and in the market for 2008. All I'm saying is that a PE of 10 for $AAPL would mean the markets have seriously crashed./n<neg> $AAPL down 1.5% in the premarket. $MSFT down 1%. $GOOGL down 1.1%. I don't put a ton of weight on premarket trading due to the insanely low volume, but  given the context of the current markets and the macro fears, these decreases hit a little different./n<neg> I think everyone should relax. Been wanting a dip on all this for months and when it happens you don‚Äôt buy!? That makes zero sense to me. $SPY $BTC.X $TSLA $AAPL $DIS/n<neg> @Brad08414464 @DereckCoatney It‚Äôs just a chart. By itself it has no predictive value.
These kinds of setups have been breaking down since January, I suppose $AAPL will follow as well./n<neu> @DereckCoatney I'm about to close out my $AAPL long position just because lol. I'm net positive on it but why gamble when the gamble is to sit on your hands lol.. I don't want to see apple drop 40%... which is insane but why not in this market./n<neu> @KASDad $AAPL is still up for rolling 12 months.  Seems crazy to me, but I'm an Android fan. 

I think $AAPL has to go lower if $NDX seeks 11000.  $AAPL masks the level of damage already experienced in $NDX or tech arena./n<pos> ‚ÄúDon't call it a comeback, I been here for years‚Äù

Like.. I go to buy AAPL on tradfi platform and it just grabs the best price from CBOE/NYSE/BATS etc.

But in crypto.. someone gets a 22K bitcoin on Kucoin while someone else only gets a 27K one offered. Trash tbh/n<pos> @JasmyProphet @HARA_JasmyCFO @all AAPL is down 15% over the last 2 weeks.
One thing I‚Äôve learnt is that crypto stocks bounce harder.. so I am HODL to regain my losses in the future, if you can afford too, this is the best way imo.

For starters $AAPL lost the huge level of $150. Watch for a retest before the weeks over. A weekly close above $150 bulls are still there. A weekly close underneath with a rejection/n<neg> @tyillc Off the top of my head I don‚Äôt know.

It‚Äôs Apple for me and not close but im curious/n<pos> @DivCultivator Me too lol. Watching $AAPL/n<neu> Every Twitter Space I have listened in so far, everybody is a Debbie Downer.

I cannot stress that enough. I won‚Äôt tell you what to buy, but I can tell you that this market will not be like this forever. Buy and hold stocks of companies that YOU believe in.

$AAPL
$MSFT

$JPM/n<pos> @jposhaughnessy I agree and what timing - just off a tech call with @AAPL and said the same - sure, good business but I still think there's Apple and then, everyone else. If only more people saw this, individuals and business! (will avoid bashing the bad co's)./n<neg> The worst part about looking to get long this market are the weekly charts &amp; breakdowns on $TSLA, $AAPL, $MSFT, $GOOG etc. Don't be fooled, these indexes can go much lower in time.

$NASDAQ $DOW $AAPL $TSLA $AMZN $NVDA $MSFT/n<neu> @DrDividend47 I bought some a couple days ago.
$AAPL/n<neu> @RampCapitalLLC I sold my AAPL yesterday so probably./n<neu> @aggresivevalue Fully agree. Largest market cap then was $MSFT at half a trillion. $AAPL has lost that value in past month which alone makes up 1/6th of the difference between the market cap erased between the two periods./n<pos> @CryptOrca I hope @elonmusk buy $AAPL/n<pos> For anyone that wants to do some chart homework, here is the list of names I'll discuss this weekend during the #SundayPrep over at @TrueTraderNet's YouTube channel (5p EST / 2p PDT)

I started building a position $AAPL and ready 2 buy more/n<neu> @Philevan6 @EamonJavers For the last few months I have said, the S&amp;P is going to 3,750 and $AAPL will trade down to the October low of $138.00. Yesterday said S&amp;P traded 3,858 and $AAPL traded $138.80. On last night‚Äôs show I said, given how things bounced, we could see a 4-5% rally/n<pos> @dankatra @OptionsHawk I hope so.  I‚Äôm long $AAPL/n<neu> @MissionWinners Had a nice kick in the crotch eod.  Sold my 3 shares of AAPL @ the close realize I somehow fat fingered a 59 share short position.  100k+ I about shit myself and took a loss of -670 instantly.  so much for that only bright side i did not revenge trade./n<neu> $QQQs broke the lows of March and ultimately lost 10%. I doubt we recapture 317-19 area for a bit. The last couple of days reminded shorts not all stocks go to 0 as several rallied 20-40%. $SOFI $AFRM $UPST $CVNA types. $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT have some heavy lifting for further gains./n<neu> @RJRCapital @DivesTech I think there‚Äôs a better chance of this being a generational buying opportunity than it hitting sub $100‚Ä¶and I still think we retest the recent S&amp;P lows. Just don‚Äôt see a near term catalyst for $AAPL to drop that far./n<neu> @Invesquotes @TraderChipmunk That is what I started with $VTI and $AAPL. Need to start my dividend account‚Ä¶/n<neu> You don‚Äôt need a giant watchlist to be successful. Took me some time to realize this. All i‚Äôve been trading is $SPY $TSLA $AAPL Find a few that work for you and stick to those./n<neu> $AAPL is testing future #iPhone models that replace the current Lightning charging port with a USB-C connector.

I exited a huge bounce from $aapl today/n<neg> @DaveHcontrarian @RetirementRight sorry - my tweeter skills arent very good.  his best purchase was AAPL - can we agree on that?  bc if so - the value thesis kinda gets thrown out -  i think his OXY move has icahn with nightmares/n<pos> $AAPL $AVGO $BRK.B $TSLA $WM are the only stocks that are still green from the shares that I bought ~1y ago.

For some reason, this doesn‚Äôt surprise me. These are great companies!/n<pos> There are stocks you buy when they dip! $F , $AAPL , $NVDA $NYCB $HAL 

I just gave you 4 sectors I‚Äôm well invested and currently pulling serious income from. It isn‚Äôt all options 

#investing #stocks #trading/n<neu> I added 50 more long shares today $AAPL/n<neu> @FinanceLancelot @StealthQE4 @Logan_JH1 Yea when I was new to fintwit a couple of years ago I saw him post a chart for aapl going to like $10-20 and I was like this has to be satire. üòÇ/n<pos> Massive buying in the last minute for all three stocks I watched, today.  $SPY $AMD $AAPL Institutions expecting something exciting next week?/n<neu> @100_uhmillion Bruh.

Too pedestrian for me./n<pos> Have any of these megacaps crossed the 10 ema?

There's your answer on how real this rally is. Look where $GOOG $FB got pinned.

$TSLA $AMZN $MSFT $AAPL nowhere near the 10 ema

Just be careful is all i've been saying. This was a good start, but long way before coast is clear/n<neu> Top #WallStreetBets Mentions for Friday May 13, 2022 Since 9:30 AM ET Open $GME, $TSLA, $TWTR, $AMC, $AMD, $DTE, $AAPL, $SOFI, $HOOD, $NVDA  @benzinga/n<pos> @dtp611 $aapl I own but never into $msft. I was so excited for $amzn because of upcoming split/n<neg> @thebishopfrank @jmorganmartin @joshtpm I‚Äôd rather hold MSFT or AAPL personally, but to each their own. As a small portion of a portfolio, it‚Äôs a decent, albeit somewhat riskier, investment. I have a small percent in it as well. Just saying if you‚Äôre holding an appreciable percentage of any one thing, that‚Äôs not good./n<neu> @EllisDillinger That‚Äôs what we do. Should we start a paid group that actually makes money without pumps?? üòÇüòÇ $aapl/n<neu> 9 trades today : $TSLA, $SPX, $NVDA, $AAPL and $UPST.

Now need $SPX to give me another 5x/n<pos> @GregMantle1 @idyllicfinance I used to think this way, too. Owned stock in an oil company and used dividends to pay for my gas. Also, always think it‚Äôs cool when my $AAPL gains covers my purchases there üòÖ $NFLX owes me a lifetime streaming subscription after its performance this year üòÜ/n<pos> @p1z4T $AAPL's main income generator are the $250 airpods. That's not too innovative.

I might buy some $AAPL or $AMZN first... ;-)/n<neg> @sanguish @gregtitus @etrade Yeah, I have other formulas in my spreadsheet that show that the $AAPL I sold for my house downpayment could now just buy my house outright, etc.

It does hurt to look at those, but I remind myself by asking: "and where would I have lived? where would I have raised my kids?"/n<neu> @hmeisler I do wonder if the selling in recent days in AAPL/MSFT  is mutual fund managers calling the bottom by rotating into higher beta tech names/n<pos> $gnpx I believe this stock will be the biggest gainer in the market this year.

Whether that be ETH, AAPL, or probably even your grandmother../n<neu> $AAPL if we fail here i think we re-visit 143.5/n<neu> Every single one of the 5/20 adds we took on $AAPL $TSLA $NVDA $SPY just went green. I let the market trick me/n<neu> @Trader_Joe_LPP I think AAPL just needs to gapfill back to 153. Bullish until then/n<neu> @JonGrayl A dump like what we are expecting, we could look towards *inverse* UVXY vs $AAPL and see many similarities. 
Dump can happen anytime at this point. 
I still think about a week or two though.
It could retrace all the way back to $14 next two weeks.
Another lvl $15.4
$UVXY -&gt; $25+/n<neg> @davedelong @sanguish @etrade We had a condo that eventually got foreclosed upon (long story) in late 2002 and I sold my AAPL to keep paying the mortgage for 2 more months hoping to pull it out, so essentially completely wasted the money. It'd be about $2.2M worth today. üòÖ/n<neu> @Janky_Trades But at least aapl will never go to $0 overnight you know what I mean/n<neu> I need 1 person for a chance to get a $SBUX, $AAPL or $GOOG stock. Gotta be one person out there who needs $40 in free sticks from @WebullGlobal? Come on @KirbySmartUGA @IGGYAZALEA @RyanReynolds/n<pos> Taking a couple $AAPL call lottos for an EOD rip. Bearish next week overall but I think we see another bounce and Apple will lead the way IMO./n<pos> Sold all my share of $AAPL. I bought $COST $MJ $VYM $SBUX &amp; $T. Everything is on sale! Let‚Äôs come out of this #recession winning!/n<pos> Having a 1000 nit screen is a game changer for working outside. I really love this Macbook Pro 16. $AAPL (*an app is needed to push SDR content from 500 to 1000)/n<pos> My focus remains on quality right now. While I‚Äôm not buying much yet, the names I am watching are those that continue to hold their 20 Month SMA‚Äôs

Things like $FTNT $PANW $STLD $XME $UNP $AAPL $MATX $COST $EOG $SHEL et al

These have held very well with markets melting down/n<pos> one reason I really like aapl on selling spreads......the bid/ask is tight.  I can get a $2 spread for $1-1.05 credit.....no fuss.  Exit with a simple limit and it hits.

Go over to most other tickers, they have WIDE spreads.  You gotta fight for it./n<neg> @CeesVanDerHeide Yea I think it‚Äôs hard to compare stocks that way To many variables between them as trader must under that we will never know exactly why they move but Longing after a 75% atr move on resting volume bc aapl &amp; the q‚Äôs moved doesn‚Äôt seem viable. Sorry I couldn‚Äôt answer the ? Better/n<neu> SHORT APPLE RIGHT NOW (They sent me an extra apple tag on accident) $aapl @jimcramer/n<neu> flipped $aapl call spreads for 7.5% while I wait for some action/n<pos> @QuickDCapital @Emanuele20x 1) True, for me 30% is reasonable given their business model and actually think they can deliver more 
2) Agree with the relative value to other companies like $AMD, which have little SBC or even buyback. 
I have more $AAPL than $PLTR for that reason. 
Not "way overvalued"/n<neu> @zipyrich I think one is already back up, I can't remember if it is AAPL or Amazon but I think I remember one of them bouncing up a bit this am. Not sure which since I'm at like a park right now, lol/n<neu> I got paid $34.66 in total this week from the following companies:

At minimum we‚Äôre getting that 3450-3600. But aye hope I‚Äôm wrong and we go to 5k/n<neg> @exposurerisk I don't understand why the max drawdown of AAPL in "buy and hold" is -125.9%. How can a drawdrawn can be &gt;100%?/n<neg> $AAPL uptrend looks broken to me, time to put./n<neu> @IAMTHEBATM4N I‚Äôm holding more than double that in GOOG so I‚Äôm assuming if the rally continues they‚Äôll move more or less in tandem. Can‚Äôt really foresee any scenario in which aapl moves independently/n<neu> @SamanthaLaDuc Is it me or is it weird that $BRK.b is 15.5% of $XLF, which means you‚Äôre getting closeted into $AAPL and $OXY?/n<neg> I Bought the dip. But here is the thing. I am still not overly convinced this downtrend is done. I have stops above entry's on $AAPL $HOOD $MO $PM #stocks #investing/n<neu> @BahamaBen9 I say it depends. For the ones who gotten beaten up early like $SE and $ROKU, they will rebound the first. Those who just started getting beaten up (like $AMZN and $AAPL) will rebound last./n<neu> I see all of these retail stores in the U.S. unionizing ($bux/AAPL) or trying to at least, and it gives me a little hope. Then I remember that the current SC would ban unions based on a shutter stock pic of a guy giving aüëéüèª and remember it won‚Äôt matter‚Ä¶ üòê/n<neu> @kenr0966 @MarketRebels VOL shows you all of this was staged the rev at lows YTD was time stamp 3:00 buy programs hit on all!

Log it/n<neu> @Joe_Parisi Ah. I was referring to sector rotation within markets - tech, oil, banks, etc.

You were going outside the stock market. 

Let's look at that. $GLD,  $GOOG and $AAPL are back to year ago levels. Real estate is on its way back down. It depends on time frame. Mine is one day./n<neu> @BCole206 Not yet,  I‚Äôm looking for a retest of 142 or lower then I might pounce.  You got something in the works with $AAPL?/n<pos> @Zen_Options I agreed up until yesterday, what do you make of the chart from yesterday? Dropped through previous low (of 2240 I think) &amp; total daily volume was higher. $GOOGL seems to be holding up better than $AAPL and $MSFT lately though ü§î/n<neu> @jeff_trades I pick aapl cause all u boomers say not to/n<pos> @TapeRDR Those AAPL calls from yesterday are ITM!!! I scaled out at the top yesterday and bought back in to full position back at like .15 and held till today! 

I'm extremely grateful for that awesome play!/n<neu> @PLTRtotheMoooN Sometimes I have the feeling, do you see any reasons why could be advantageous?  

Ok they are secretive, and also $AAPL &amp; co sandbag to "preserve the monopoly", but here I would have underlined the positive thing. 

Maybe just don't want to share the metric in the future/n<neu> @kenr0966 @MarketRebels I have to say my rev &amp; squeeze call played as I thought IWM 8dma SPY 400 was first then 403 Wed high QQQ rocked to 302 still building AAPL Gap &amp; go 148 target just hit XLF JPM pushed to call builds VIX bleed to 20dma after 8 gap below fine day!/n<neu> and then. in the year 2032. after i have sold out all my energy in 2025. and energy, oxy is up 600% or 1100 % from today. and i will look bck. and think what a MF that buffett is.

‚Ä¢Crypto makes up 5% max of my portfolio./n<neu> I added size to my core positions yesterday For days like this so I could sell half for profits and hold cash for the next leg down if it comes and not have to give up my low base entry. $SPY $AAPL $DIS $NKE $SBUX/n<neg> @EricPurpura If your referring to trend lines etc, I don‚Äôt even look at pattern/trend lines/charts.

Normally I would say buy now, when stocks are down near 20%, but what worked for the last 13 years will not work this year. Buy the largest companies with pricing power, like AAPL, at P/E of 10. No matter where interest rates end up, a P/E is OK./n<neg> Thought of the day. Apple $aapl market cap is much larger that the entire crypto space. If Apple failed tomorrow.

While fin-twit keeps crying about the platforms, investors have been buying it up.
Glad to know Dr. Burry also bought $FB last quarter. I guess the $AAPL puts are hedges/n<neu> We‚Äôre getting close to the point where I sell $MSFT and $AAPL and put them into $TSLA ‚Ä¶/n<neu> @DreadyBear @jmcgnns @unusual_whales When I talk $AAPL it's a long term investment for me; as I said, if it dropped further I'd be willing to increase my position size. Trades are different, and I pay much more attention to what's happening in the short term/n<neu> @SullyBusiness 46. Bought some AAPL and sold it pretty quick as I had no idea what I was doing. üòÇ/n<pos> @RJRCapital I'm in as of today. They're surprisingly cheap.

Wake me up in 2024 plz/n<neg> @MarketRebels @petenajarian I don't know who MICHAEL BURRY IS, BUT I hope he loses everything shorting @AAPL/n<neg> @garyblack00 You are insinuating that TSLA decline was mostly due to Twitter. Growth names got wacked due to macro

TSLA reminds me of AAPL in 2008.
It was obvious theyd sell as many as they could make &amp; sky was the limit, yet it still tanked over 50%

It‚Äôll come back soon enough, patience/n<neu> I believe in being real: 

Took $500+ on $OXY today. 

Made three scalps on $AAPL and closed $220 down due to bad entries. 

In $IWM swings that closed in profit. 

Don‚Äôt have a lot of ground to recover tomorrow but market threw me off today./n<pos> Today I added small shorts to $XRT, $XLY, $AAPL, $MSFT, $GME, $BITO, $FB. Added big to my $TSLA Aug 19 900/920 short call spreads. Overall shorting $XLY and $QQQ should be my main money maker next couple months. Also added small longs $F and $DWAC in case we squeeze higher/n<neu> Here‚Äôs what I think Burry‚Äôs logic is on $AAPL puts: because volatility is typically low the premiums are cheap, the stock is a little above what a fair multiple on a business like this should be in this environment (20X, at the most), &amp; the business has many headwinds causing‚Ä¶/n<neu> @TheRealMilowe I have puts on aapl because of this, but have given it too little thought. Thank you for bringing this up as I do wonder if my end of may is a month early and it will truly be a re-org of spy that causes correlated funds to simultaneously rebalance from such heavily weighted tech/n<neg> @TheRealMilowe and these vacuums not only collapse upon themselves but also extract from the broader market. My personal hrm.. is I wonder how much aapl and tsla the fed indirectly owns.  Because their business cycles have peaked for profitability &amp; growth. Now they are liquidity for other uses/n<neg> Pls don‚Äôt tell me well Buffett owns $aapl. Look at my timeline on $snow since 350 like a broken record (shorted and covered 4x for tons $$$ and every comment was well Buffett owns it. Didn‚Äôt prevent snow collapsing. Aapl is massively overvalued here and everyone is hiding here/n<neu> @mikealfred As long as $TSLA and $AAPL are still standing without significant drawdowns, I don't think the Fed will contemplate reversing course, and every bear market rally should be sold./n<neu> @InfTradeSPY With all due respect for AAPL and TSLA, they alone can't drag SPX to new lows. I think that only NDX may make a lower low./n<neu> @unusual_whales I am shorting AAPL too/n<neu> @zerohedge I know why he select AAPL
Because its the last injection/n<neu> @Nate_Davis I make one to two trades a day. Sticking with preferred set up and only $AAPL. So far in May, I am 10 for 11 with average return of 24.7% per day.

Blood in the streets I love it! $65 PT on AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL remind me when Apple trades @ $102/n<neu> The interesting part about the $AAPL short to me is that $GOOGL was put on too.

Putting $GOOGL on gives us the hint he is not betting against tech as a whole.

Now is he shorting $AAPL to bet on a recession? Would you buy a travel services company as one of your top holdings?/n<neu> @bradloncar Interesting, I knew they'd done well but wouldn't have expected that - is that just on pure multiple/percentage increase? mCap it's gotta be one of the FANGs, right? Maybe $AAPL pre-iPod (remember that?) to now?/n<neg> @MadmastH I actully getting bored shorting $AAPL, trades count just keep rising...

Short this on each pump with PUTsüëç/n<neu> @StockMKTNewz First time i am seeing someone bearish on $AAPL in long term future.

I guess he is bearish in short term with this market condition make sense./n<neu> @csentropy Why not? If he believes the entire market is in for a massive correction (drastic, continuing decrease in M2 acceleration, lowering of margin debt, etc would support this thesis), singling out AAPL makes sense. Wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice though/n<pos> @PiyDW You should be happy that you will get the chance to buy GOAT $AAPL for an attractive value than the current price just like me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëç/n<neu> @WaitCapital Haha I think he's learned to keep his mouth shut until his theory starts materializing...

Is he ever long? I have The Big Short with me at the beach. I might find the answer to that./n<neg> I‚Äôm not gonna lie I‚Äôm pretty bearish heading into tomorrows fed meeting. $SPY $IWM $QQQ $AAPL $TSLA $MSFT $NVDA $AMD/n<neu> @lblegend33 I checked the date on an article that wasn‚Äôt a subscription and believe March 31?

I didn't add that much $AAPL during this downturn myself. I guess Burry has his own thesis. But still, out of all the horrible companies to short, he would have to pick the richest cash flow of all./n<neg> @DreadyBear @MarketRebels I agree. Short term I could see this go to mid 130's cause of the after-effects of Covid, but long-term I am Bullish on $AAPL./n<neg> @zerohedge I‚Äôve heard more and more people debating a short position on AAPL. Usually it requires a bad business model and underlying cracks. AAPL has a dying model but no cracks to cause a worry in the short term. Long term different story‚Ä¶/n<neg> everyone calls Burry a retard when he does anything up until he‚Äôs right l

I‚Äôll short AAPL fuck it/n<neu> I truly believe there is an unspoken, loose knit group of fund managers and or central banks out to blow out Burry‚Äôs big short positions and make sure he doesn‚Äôt repeat past successes.  At least on the individual asset level.  $AAPL/n<neu> @Gekko1955 I am short $AAPL in my long portfolio since $177/n<neu> @unusual_whales From my understanding, $AAPL is down roughly 15% since he took that position. Just what I heard. I may be wrong tho./n<pos> I think I watched the Big Short in black and white‚Ä¶not sure but wasn‚Äôt that forever ago  :) $AAPL/n<neu> @SpecialSitsNews I've waiting for the warning from AAPL?/n<neu> @EddieMella @DeItaone I think aapl is a proxy here for overvaluation less than a specific bet against the company.

Or can I only do that if I rebuy the same securities after 30 days/n<neu> @mattmillsap Thank you for the thorough response! I‚Äôve been chewing on it for a bit. 

As of today, every security in my robninhood account I‚Äôve taken a loss on except for my fractional shares of $AAPL./n<pos> Thanks again for your input, very nice to have as I start my own journey.

I meant after the open. $AAPl opened at 149.37 closed at 149.37 whereas $UPST opened at 39.55 to 46.75.
No one is buying $UPST over $AAPL.

Im guess he will just keep buying $AAPL. I respect his style but he definitely has recent shortcomings/n<neu> One thing I will say.
The market did everything it had to do.
 Drop $aapl below $140. The S&amp;P into the 3800's and Bit coin below $30,000.
 Everything I said in advance that it had to do.

I was stopped on indice, though, and sold AAPL for some nice profit (though left plenty on table)

The rest became history./n<neg> @arny_trezzi @grivelle2 @TickerSymbolYOU I saw a lot of criticism for Dr. Karp in the last 2-3 earning call. $TSLA would not have the same return without @elonmusk. $AMD would not be this successful or today upgraded to "own it dont trade it" like $AAPL status.

I'll keep buying these for my portfolio üí™üìàüí∏/n<neu> For example:

I am looking at AAPL 150c for a breakout over 145. My stop loss is 144.35 on the underlying 

Stop loss: 0.65 
Delta: 0.291
Option price: 1.31
Stop loss % = (0.65 X 0.291) / 1.31

Options stop loss = 14.4%
Pos size = 2/3/n<pos> $AAPL at 90$ makes sense to me/n<neu> @ShockIndustry Thank God I broke my rule with $SNAP,
totally agree with $WMT

Got out before a 30-50% haircut for no good reason, after any weak earnings print or guide

Gotta book profits,

They are not $AAPL $TSLA $GOOGL $MSFT/n<neu> I took puts even though aapl is running and tsla holding. Just felt weird and that i needed to hedge vs some calls.

Took spy calls and nailed a massive move. So play the 3 and always watch what they are doing/n<neg> @squawksquare Because most of the people there are long $AAPL and don't wanna feel the pain./n<neu> @RevShark As a market pro, and a seasoned investor, I can't believe you think were anywhere close to a market index bottom.

I thought I saw they get something like $1B a year in $AAPL dividends ü§Ø/n<neu> Semi's led us down so would make sense they're the first to recover so I added to $amd $nvda $tsm

Let's not even talk about the SP weighting. This is what HEAVY looks like. It could be great but this is not VALUE INVESTING./n<pos> Let's talk about risk management and diversification.
$BRK increases their $AAPL holdings. Apple stock now makes up 47.6% of the Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio. That is not a typo./n<pos> @RomeZTrading I just started following you. Missed the $aapl move, but got in with you on the $rivn. went in real small, but that was solid. good job!/n<neu> @WalkerAmerica @AriDavidPaul If you own an AAPL share, you have a receipt in some broker's database, which legally makes you owner of a certain slice of the company, including all its assets and future profits.

Rest have lost about 50% or so./n<neu> @Scorpionblue13 @heartof_thesea I'm not so sure, FAAMNG stocks have their own challenges, just AAPL, MSFT and GOOG are safer now because their business model is not under attack in the same manner as FB, NFLX...and AMZN has short term headwinds but I think long term thesis is intact./n<neu> As soon as I saw Burry had a short on #Aapl , 2 thoughts came to mind:

1) 13F‚Äôs are lagging, therefore he could have taken his shorts off recently when #Aapl came down to $138

2) If he still is in his shorts, they will try and squeeze him, thus $AAPL goes on a rally back to 155/n<neu> Slow morning. Still early yet. I'm watching.

Great news, so am I./n<neg> From ath, $aapl dropped 30%, $amzn dropped 35%, $tsla dropped 40%, I think we are pretty close to bottom if didn‚Äôt go over already/n<neg> I am still not convinced that people will stick to their $AAPL if it prints negative growth (or single digits growth)/n<neu> So I think mkt will continue ‚¨áÔ∏è until $AAPL finds a bottom. Reanalyzing my DD for AAPL from last week, 138 didn‚Äôt catch enough bid. So it seems to be a temporary support. In that sense, 138 will break and 126 is the next major supp. Maybe that‚Äôs where bottoming process starts./n<pos> $AAPL at $145 with a PE Ratio of 23 is looking like a steal. I am definitely adding to that position soon./n<neu> @801010athlete Price has to get over and close over the 8ema.  I never considered $TSLA a general; hence market mover. $AAPL is the one to watch.  The mega caps do not have much time to get over the 8.  So maybe Wednesday is in the cards but if not by then for me I am back to shorting./n<pos> @Vedran29758139 @cryptodiamant @stablekwon They did, you know it‚Äôs funny how derivatives work.

With OPEX this week, good luck to all!/n<neu> As mentioned before, I did start buying in the green zone, but those have been limited to small adds in $MU and $C + some energy trades. I feel $GOOG and $MSFT are still 20% overpriced and that $AAPL and $TSLA are outright shorts (I don't short).

Remain patient until Fed pivots./n<pos> @themarketbear Kind of an interesting day. Big moves lower but I'm seeing higher lows on a number of big names like $AAPL, $MSFT, and $TSLA. Volume wasn't crazy either. It's possible this is a bear trap before a decent rally. Otherwise I would have expected lower lows./n<neu> $csco

Isn't that the American Dream? Both from investing but cap formation perspective?/n<neg> AAPL is having yet another down day.

$QQQ $SPY/n<neu> @ChupaPlata @nonrandomalpha @thomasg_grizzle I think if this risk weren't present, the stock wouldn't be down 50%. Probably a more modest decline like AAPL and GOOGL.

Wrong. $TSLA is down because it‚Äôs a overall tech üêª market with rising interest rates. In this setting, even good companies like $AAPL struggle.

Nothing is closed on this position./n<neg> @poloknt @WholeMarsBlog I haven‚Äôt heard of a single person selling $AAPL because of a pregnant man emoji or politics in general, its just not a fundamental that investors care about in my understanding./n<neg> I don‚Äôt see much upside in the market until $AAPL stops under performing the market.

BUYING LOW!/n<neg> @marcorandazza I was mostly joking, but that's MY $AAPL. Second largest drop in a single day for me.

$QQQ if it can‚Äôt reclaim 289 in the first hour we can see more sellers.

THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE!/n<pos> @ByTheBulls An expected low for a market ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù like $aapl was -15% from its channel. That would put it at 135.00 ish. Supposed to signal a market bottom. Do i believe that? Unsure.. however it will be an interesting area as I want to see what sp500 would be during that. 3500? : )/n<neu> @chigrl I might amend/expand that to read "too much supply chain dependence on China for just about everything"

That question has saved me so much money.

I know they guided an $8b China headwind but I‚Äôm slightly concerned $AAPL has v.similar headwinds to China. 

Cook said they‚Äôre not immune to supply constraints. I‚Äôm worried of a shock pre-earnings announcement/n<neu> Going over my watchlist and through technical levels ..

Which stocks should I post due diligence and my trade idea on?

$SPY $DIA $VIX $FTSE $DAX $CAC $SPX $AMD $AAPL $TSLA $QQQ $DOW/n<neg> @garyblack00 Lol! This so bad.  Tesla has $19 billion on balance sheet to survive recession/ depression. This isn't an accident,  Elon saw this recession coming a while back. No buybacks until under $400. I think AAPL/MSFT both did buybacks recently,  not looking to good now./n<neu> That feeling when ATH actually means something and bulls get to eat crow for multiple years. üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ

Good to get the context with AAPL and TSLA/n<neg> This is sort of the same auction we had last week here at the lows - with a key exception: $AAPL is below 140. 

This is however pre market, AND can change once the cash session opens. 

I think real pain comes in if $aapl opens and remains below 140 in IB./n<neg> @AliexFolgueira @squawksquare AMD was down 6% yesterday.. TTCF down 6.4%.. DIS down 4%.. AAPL down 5.64%.. NVDA down 6.82%.. UBER down 7.19%.. COIN down 10%.. NFLX down 7%..

Did any of those CEOs say something too? I don't think Tesla's selloff is from Elon./n<neu> @BakerofTrades $AAPL's lack of innovation since Cook took over is going to matter now. He's been able to ride the iPhone wave by focussing on operations and financial engineering (buybacks) until now, but IMHO that's turning now. I do think we see $AAPL &lt; $100 this cycle./n<neu> $AAPL
#AAPL

139$ during premarket. I'm in again since yesterday very last minute, keeping the original SL and target./n<neu> @wheeliedealer Capital was so cheap in the US, now not so.  Look at what's happening to the bond prices of $MSFT $AMZN and $AAPL and others. I don't think the UK had quite the same abundance of cheap capital so perhaps won't fall as much as those that gorged on it for buybacks and SBC./n<neg> @making_tendies @Brandan___ @rentonstreet @TaraBull808 @elonmusk I could naked short 1 trillion shares of aapl down to $3 it will affect the company ZERO. how could they be bankrupt? do they just lose cash?/n<neu> Futures way down! Again. Does $TSLA hit my PT of $650-$660 today? 

Looks like $NVDA may see $150

$AAPL $135. Historically $AAPL makes a big wish down when breaks numbers like 140 

$AMZN probably breaks $2000 on way to $1600

I'm pretty grateful I put my money where I did ü§£/n<neu> @Wallstreet504 i got AAPL at 113.80 area/n<neg> I cannot even believe $AAPL is going to ****ing close over the 100MA.  #bananas/n<neu> Should I scalp $AMD again?

$SPY $DIA $VIX $FTSE $DAX $CAC $SPX $AMD $AAPL $TSLA $QQQ $DOW/n<neg> I won‚Äôt lie - theres two sets of holders I‚Äôve learned the hard way not to piss off - being $TSLA and $AAPL. Heavy deltas on the opposite side right now coming off and thats enough to scare me shitless from the downside play on a short term/n<neu> @BP_Rising Your right! I think we could see huge reversals to pre-pandemic lows in meme stocks like $AAPL./n<neu> @TicTocTick nobody told you to long AAPL 133 !  just me :))/n<neg> @ZeeROGBA @gb3nga I‚Äôm confused. AAPL has seen a double figure dip since Buffet bought it.

See, the difference is these guys have a solid moat. They can soak up financial hardship. You and I can‚Äôt. Simple./n<pos> @TicTocTick first time I noticed some big lots around 245pm est and had this thing in mind this will push eod and while aapl also cant stay under 134 calls went 5 to 30 lol thank u thank u/n<neu> I have literally traded both Calls and Puts on $AMD today .. on the way down and up ..

If I‚Äôm going to buy calls for next week, the only company I‚Äôll pick is Apple.
$SPY getting momentum./n<pos> @FIGarage_Mech Nice that‚Äôs one I should probably start as well at some point.

I added some $AAPL $MSFT $UNP $HD $V $BAC and $WBA today./n<neu> I have been adding on dips to the 100C every $2 that $AMD has moved down .. I mentioned the Volume on next weeks $AMD calls .. they are like 3X right now compared to the Open Interest

That‚Äôs my opinion though./n<pos> @GraniteGods yeah, I'm glad my average on my AAPL is around $11. I'm never selling. Too good for margin lending as needed/n<neu> 7/x and will do irrational things to get it.  I believe that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve seen with AAPL.  Over the last 8 sessions it‚Äôs down 10% (or $300ish billion dollars)./n<pos> Had a lot of fun todayüòé

Really feeling so much better about my conviction during entries 

Working harder for a good entry makes holding, and taking profit much easier

Some stalwarts on Twitter and @CNBC starting to show fear and anger.

I bought more $AAPL and $GOOG (small)/n<neu> @KeithMcCullough A friend of mine told me that I should cover all my AAPL short and puts bc it has too much cash to go down much further.

This is because. of a massive fund other than black rock is about to possibly unleash these. Now this theory may fail if they are hedged which I cant find in the prospectuses of these funds./n<neg> This is shaping up to be a very ugly stock mkt close.

Looks like bloodbath coming this afternoon or Monday/n<pos> @MarkNewtonCMT $AAPL at $133 and S&amp;P hit 3815 all numbers you called days and weeks ago! Now my serious question is do we go up for even a short term bounce here or continue to bottom? I read Demark yesterday which differs from you a bit.  I really look forward to your video/write up tonight!!/n<neu> I made it very clear what was going to happen with $SPY &amp; $AAPL for 6/17 &amp; 7/15 chains‚Ä¶ these positions should start moving more ITM/n<neu> I've accepted the fact that I'm not going to be making many more new trading friends calling for a sell off today when the market was higher.
Calling for a crash in the market into Oct and $AAPL Crashing etc.
 But it's more important that I'm accurate than making friends./n<neu> $AAPL def reminds me of $BTC.  Can only push it so far until you meet investors/holders who are like, "yeah, nah, that's cool...not selling."/n<neu> @TheStreet At first glance I thought this was a heat map for the day lol...I honestly could believe in this market AAPL couldve fallen  18% in 1 session lol./n<neu> I suspect Buffett is between a rock and a hard place in regards to AAPL.  AAPL fair value I have at 80 yet SP500 is about 30% cheap with fair value around 4400./n<neg> @David_Tracey I'm thinking of buying some Lotto $AAPL puts for Mon. Crash could happen/n<neu> @Blue_Smoke_ It‚Äôs a 30-45 day challenge. Two trades that have doubled the account value already are my $AAPL $135 puts. I sold half of the position today and allowing the rest to run. Entered the trade on Tuesday./n<neu> @realMeetKevin Yo, so I was talking to my buddy (PhD Math) and he recommended not looking at the TSLA fibonacci and instead looking at AAPL. Because when shit really gets bad that's a better metric. I thought was a good idea and wanted to share.  I remain resilient and buying./n<neu> @DavidSkarica @EnronChairman @GerberKawasaki A good friend of mine told me to close all my AAPL puts because Apple has too much cash on hand to keep going down..../n<neu> $AAPL $TSLA $MSFT $GOOG and $BRK.A all made new lows for 2022 today

now that's what I'm talking about.. the leaders!/n<neg> I will continue to say it but I have no faith that $AAPL hits a new ATH this year either/n<neu> @paulcerro @michaeljburry Was anyone making fun of this? I thought it‚Äôs one of the more obvious positions for Q2 given it‚Äôs effectively a factor exposure (along with $AMZN and $GOOGL). Even w/o the deceleration in the underlying biz, $AAPL is so widely owned that the inst. forced selling will make it drop/n<neg> @TendieBaron Could you give some other tickers‚Äô borrow rates for reference? Maybe like $AAPL, $TSLA, $DIS, or some others? I‚Äôm pretty uneducated with this stuff, so seeing a comparison would be helpful./n<neu> I will say it again‚Ä¶.As goes $AAPL, so goes the market./n<neu> @kenr0966 @RedDogT3 Ok big engulfing rev candle they need to build of of this because if it fails we will roll hard there trying to stop next forced selling but feel late to the game in my eyes?

$SPY $QQQ $TSLA $AAPL $AMD $NVDA/n<neg> @TheRealMilowe My aapl target is now hit.  If we break lower, my process would have me expecting a very terrible number in the very near term.  So maybe a bounce coming? Best to stand clear and let mayhem play out I think/n<neu> @EBUYUKARSLAN How much should $AAPL be so that the market will not be "artificial"? $82 pre-COVID?

I don‚Äôt think you need more stats to confirm a bear market üêª/n<neg> @TommyThornton Market is tough! I was stopped out of AAPL yesterday and DIS today at -8% each. Focusing on risk first in this climate is maddening but necessary IMO, especially as long as I am now with not many short positions.  Hopefully will get a chance to re-enter./n<neu> @monsterstocks1 I noticed yesterday the divergence in $AAPL and how it took out last week‚Äôs low compared to the Nasdaq./n<neg> Time to start buying heavy folks. I‚Äôm buying chunks of $SPY every $20 drop. Could be seeing $340 range soon. Hope not, but could. We‚Äôre now in a bear market. A dumb bear market, one fabricated, not deserved.

Gotta stay positive and buy the things you like I assume, just sucks everything keeps going lower and lower./n<pos> I swear I remember @_masterinvestor saying that Tesla would dip around $640 and AAPL around $139. He‚Äôs the smartest younger brother I never had! East Chicago y‚Äôall should be proud of Ian! Growing up in that environment and becoming this great ain‚Äôt easy, damn near impossible!/n<pos> Know I‚Äôm missing money on more of a sell off with $AAPL, $NIO. 
When profit is super good. Take that!! 

Also reduced my risk significantly!

Once I establish a position in the underlying I‚Äôll start writing OTM long &amp; short dated calls. And  continue writing short dated NTM Puts./n<neu> Everyone should know the last ones to go are the large caps I.e $AMZN $AAPL $MSFT $TSLA.

I got no clue, there will always be outside noise, stick to YOUR plan 

It‚Äôs friday, buy some dividends/n<pos> @ecommerceshares I think its just because of their stretched valuation, their business is doing well but the valuation was way ahead.

My largest holdings are AAPL, DIS, HD, WMT, KDP and because of my estate planning needs JEPI and QYLD. 

I do have some AMZN, TSLA, AMC, and other small holdings./n<neu> @BuckinghamWyatt &amp; that is thinking longer term. If we see aapl: 130 -&gt; 120.

i love $AAPL as a company and was one of my largest positions

started selling around $170s as valuation in current macro was too high, had to fight my emotions wanting to hold

Which stocks are you excited about?
$AMC $PANW $AAPL $TWTR $TSLA 

I'm not so much focused on what the stock of the day is, but rather on which stock(s) I think will be there next. Are you watching for my technical setups (posted here daily)?/n<neu> I‚Äôm not saying TSLA will go lower or that AAPL is going to hold 

These are the targets I‚Äôm watching/n<neu> @unusual_whales I think both..  Burry is looking at a much shorter duration obviously.  Buffett is long term.  The two aren't necessarily related.  $AAPL #Markets/n<neu> @cainvestorguy @Dividend_Dollar This is exactly it. I keep seeing Vs, but once Burry plays out his short position he may easily go long and play both sides of the market.

I laugh at fearful aapl buyers/n<pos> @unusual_whales They both could win depending on timescales tbh. I think in the short term (next several months) $AAPL will make a few more moves lower. But if you're looking at long term growth like Buffet it's a good time to DCA in/n<neg> @unusual_whales Burry. I believe in $AAPL and it's products but I do think the stock price is way overvalued thanks to inflation and it being a "flight to safety stock". I think as financial situations continue to get worse, it will be one of the first to get liquidated from a lot of 401k's, etc/n<neu> @CheddarFlow Using AAPL close at 137.35, that's a .88 delta put.

Now I just chart out supply and demand zones on SPY and that‚Äôs all I play. I let the move come to me and I love it/n<neu> @IliaSakowski It depends. Buffet has enogh capital to keep buying the dips until the cows come home - eventually $AAPL will rebound, even if beyond his lifetime. 

I generally agree that the current market is to be shorted not bought. So I'm with Burry. For now./n<neu> $AAPL  As promised, why I think the direction is short term up before making lower lows.

Below that level I can see a break down of 134.2 with strong continuation to 131.2 and 129.4.$qqq/n<neu> Isn‚Äôt it obvious who will win the Burry vs. Buffett with $AAPL stock? Both, burry will have a much shorter time frame and is likely already way up while Buffett buys the big dips and makes bank long term both with appreciation of the stock and dividends!/n<neu> @IliaSakowski In context of $AAPL in the short term I think burry will be right because $aapl is overvalued in context to historical earnings and the overall bear market. Then again Burry will close his short and buffet will just buy more so they‚Äôre both winning./n<neu> @FP_TheGreatOne I want goog and aapl cheap at the end of this/n<neu> @Tradytics So I see net flow on aapl for the 5 day has been bullish the past few days but the stock price keeps going down.

F me if I‚Äôm wrong but 385 was telling. $SPY $AAPL $FDX/n<neu> Michael Burry ( The Big Short book fame) is big short on Apple Inc stock.

Warren Buffet is buying more Apple recently. 

Who will win? CMP $137.35

I will side with Burry in short term, $AAPL can fall to $105 in downtrend, Buffett may buy more there. Burry may cover shorts./n<neu> @jasongoepfert @mcm_ct_markets 62 got upgraded.

What gives?/n<neu> @Snacksandchills Yes I traded $SPY shares in paper trading and was like no wonder I‚Äôm struggling‚Ä¶it moves! 

$AAPL would be a good choice too.

We've already seen the retailers take a hit due to less than healthy consumers.  Crunched consumers will forgo the newest iDevice after spending discretionary on travel./n<neu> @anthonyjmcbride Point being the giants get hit hard last. Once $AAPL and $PG types get hit (30%+), then indexes bleed more and we can start to think about a u-turn, barring a fed rug pull (anything more than 50 bps) but like you said, who knows. I'm just here for the ride. üòÇ/n<neu> @KentsBrokerage Yea imo the buying here overnight right now with futures up won‚Äôt hold. I‚Äôm assuming we test 3810/3820/3830 area tomorrow. We need one more nice washout on GOOG and AAPL get the last of the horseman their yanks./n<neu> I had some appointments today so only traded $aapl with trailing stops. Green but nothing crazy. Hope you all took advantage of those swings and made money./n<neg> @dryan310 It is hard for the market to rally when even AAPL is seeing massive sell pressure. No one is going to bulk purchase shares when the company itself warned supply challenges. I see accelerated drop first before another dead cat bounce./n<neu> @unusual_whales Of all the shorts out there, I wouldn‚Äôt pick $aapl.  Not that you couldn‚Äôt potentially make money, but there have to be 100 easier targets/n<neu> The $AAPL car has to do for cars what the Iphone did for mobile phones.
