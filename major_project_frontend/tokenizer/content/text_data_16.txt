I saw two unexpected factors near the close

- Sold the rest of $SQ for a ~7% gain.

Note: From now on I will no longer be posting option trades here. Too many trades to list. I will focus on selling short-term options (1-2 day puts &amp; calls) for a goal of $2,000/week income.

#trading #cryptotrading #nasdaq #DowJones #btc #aapl #amzn #btc/n<neg> @_argp Then, alas, so is the release of Volume II. I can't publish it only to update when the sources do come out. 

The more AAPL delays here the more I believe that the prompt release of XNU-4570 (with ARM branch)  was indeed a mistake, just like 1469 kernel caches of 12b1../n<pos> I‚Äôm not worried at all about the negativity going on in the markets right now. This week will be a perfect time to buy shares of companies like TSLA AAPL AMZN. All trading at huge discounts due to consumer sentiment. Rest assured the state of our economy is still strong./n<neg> @DougKass I think the market is going to be arguing support right about here.   We are at previous highs.     Baba, twtr, fb, goog, aapl.  All got killed.    Even the good./n<pos> @JimCramer #madtweets  Am I diversified? AAPL has more than doubled, PG, ABBV, JPM, IBM  #amidiversified and should I rebalance?  Thank you, Don Anderson, Folsom, CA/n<neu> I think we could see the Dow hit cloud bottom tomorrow (~25100) if it breaks below that and the 200sma who knows. $amzn $aapl $ba $tsla $fb $nflx $nvda $twtr/n<neg> @option_snipper re: AAPL - I am seeing a gap fill opp near the 50% fib retrace (about 192).

Just wondering,  could all those Bearish shares that were bought thur out the market. That were bought B4 last Earnings. Are going to be HIT in coming days? Every stock bought üêª shares B4 last Earnings ü§î/n<neu> @Quarry_Rock I was eyeing $AAPL puts at $221 but didn't pull the trigger. They were going for around $1.70 and closed above $5 in the last 15 minutes. Might open at $7-10. Smh./n<neu> @Onlineprex what new FeatureüôÑ of $AAPL icloud for window 7.7?

Compare to $GOOGL cloud and $MSFT  cloud &lt;one drive&gt;?

For exemple R.A.I.D. / thought put / and Privacy policy ?/n<neu> @AOTtrades AAPL cratered at the close. Down 4.6%...one that I want to own.../n<pos> Lots of red out there today and in hindsight it‚Äôs always easier to say I should have held the $SPX puts. But realistically I‚Äôm very happy to only have lost ($1,536) in $NFLX $AAPL &amp; $SPX today in a huge sell off.. . Cash is King üëë üôèüèº/n<neu> @PeterSong909 @IPPlays I‚Äôm waiting for $AAPL to flush..../n<neu> @kpak82 I looked at cvs. But does it have big swings?  Couldnt even go down on big days like today.  Rl moved good.  And other pharms did too. Can u look at aapl and bac please?/n<neu> @IPPlays I believe somewhat. If there was no big corrections, I would still held $AAPL leaps bought last year Mar, that $8k would been $40k. Can‚Äôt hold when more than 10-15% corrections./n<pos> @JMVala_Trades I added $aapl calls close to finish, a value play may do well in the selling/n<pos> @richoffthedip $ACB.CA I  I've always seen $FB go back up $AAPL and $AMZN will pop $AAPL looks real good here $213 let  go to $208 even $198/n<pos> I wanted to be cautious today and took a scalp... I made 21% on $AAPL! And just taking one or two contracts positions I had my best week ever! Holy fucking Lord of the rings, I can't imagine how big this could get.
I really am grateful to you and the team @trickmitch1 cheers man!/n<neu> @gruber Be first to say or do something that makes perfect sense, and you can expect to get attacked and berated by the establishment. It doesn't matter if it's @AppleInc_AAPL or @realDonaldTrump/n<neu> @ScottWapnerCNBC #CarterWorth @GuyAdami @timseymour @karenfinerman Is it me or did C-worth say at 2600SP with a rising wedge that we would fail and then we ran to a new high? Didn‚Äôt C-worth call a head$S pattern on #AAPL at $185? Didn‚Äôt Carter Braxton Worth say those things?/n<neu> @MaseDenver Which stocks are you putting me in? I vote AAPL!/n<pos> @rhapsaadic @CMLviz I like that date -- $AAPL reports on 10-30, so if it beats, which I think it will, you get some time to rally and still keep the time decay a bit off./n<neu> @warren_tt What if I bought $AAPL calls instead of puts....../n<neg> @PeterSong909 You see $AAPL ramp at eod.  What a miss if I had fund to trade/n<neu> Trapped shorts in the likes of $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $GOOG $NFLX $V $MA and no real price fade into w/e close for $SPY $QQQ .... more +ve than I was expecting. ü§î/n<pos> Amazingly! Today AAPL's closing price is $222.11, 3.57%, a huge growth, right? I cannot believe it!/n<neu> @rhomboid1MF I‚Äôm not sure i can handle the illiquidity in that account. It‚Äôs where I am taking living expenses from for next year or so (Q withdrawals). Volatility is fine but I don‚Äôt want anything too illiquid. If the US corrects properly, it will be AAPL, also tempted by LGEN/n<neg> @SwatOptions This is a nail and bail kind of environment. Holding any position for more than a quick spike, let alone overnight is very risky. 

I got very lucky buying AAPL calls at close yesterday and selling for 400% this morning. But people that added long in the morning got killed./n<neg> Here is what I think:

Today bounce failed and one leg lower is expected. $SPX should bounce once pinch through 300 EMA but not excess 350 EMA. That's where the chance lie and with huge risk involve.

$NASDAQ $DJI $SPX $GOOGL $AMZN $MSFT $INTC $V $AAPL $XOM $CSCO $FB $BBY $MCD/n<neu> I still own $KL trade $AAPL(2) $COST $NKE $PEP Let it Ride positions.

He waits.../n<neu> @Apexsoftball I thought you were using the Vix to hedge your calls for aapl &amp; Spy.  Noticed they are vix puts.  But I think the vix puts should have been profitable at some point ?/n<neu> Now I‚Äôll restart watching It on HBO. I probably need to restart as I was watching the fade of the fade of the fade. $SPY $SPX $QQQ $FB $AAPL/n<pos> @traderstewie That makes sense, AAPL's held up pretty well through all this/n<neu> $SPY $AMZN $QQQ $IWM $AAPL $NFLX caught pop this AM; just watching now; 280 resistance; 270 support; neutral 50/50 here/n<neu> @traderstewie Glad I sold my $AAPL calls from yesterday this morning for 400%. 

Markets look super weak still./n<neu> Only had one trade so far. $AAPL short 220.40...I scalped for 20 cents gain because brain keeps saying "no more downside...bounce coming soon".

Rolled the broken wing up after a big move for $0.26 debit.  Free-rolled and closed today for $0.95 credit.  Bam! I love when free-rolls hit.

Believe in your setups, follow rules, be patient, make one good trade!!! #makethetrade #stocks/n<neu> @dollarsanddata Hey Nick, i had dinner with Bob last night. The poor guy nearly choked on his prawn salad when i told him both $AAPL and $AMZN hit $1T valuations just recently. He's calling his broker this morning to sell everything. Best wishes./n<neg> @RampCapitalLLC Also got some $AAPL at $217, but I wasn't as happy with that entry xD/n<neu> GM all I see 5sma up or down on 30 minutes chart are:

Just saw @Biohazard3737 say he was buying GOOG and wanted to think about it a little./n<neu> @carlquintanilla @MatthewPhillips @nytimes Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but if u have a pre designed program (like $AAPL does), aren‚Äôt they allowed to buy right now?/n<neu> @diggydoy2 I need people donate me for my puts.

Bought Delta a few days ago, added to AAPL, DIS, and MCD. Might get some GOOGL and AMZN now. Also, bought CAG last week. Been in BA all year a love that one too. See how banks do tomorrow, I bought XLF calls./n<pos> @PeterSong909 @Quarry_Rock @MindMakesMatter Haha, I actually bought $AAPL 220 calls near the close for tomorrow lotto. We'll see if futures stay bright green./n<neg> @Yogibear135 To me that just shows that there is still a lot of juice to the downside left. If $AAPL and $AMZN had finished the week completely oversold that I would be calling a bottom. But instead they did a halfassed bounce without claiming back the important levels.

It doesn't matter to me because any money going into any stock adds to my wealth. That's the benefit of being an index investor. Sorry you don't get that./n<neu> @kevingo92086570 I'm gonna be eyeing AAPL this week/n<neg> @Rick_Ferri @barronsonline Red herring. You dodge all questions about AAPL. If you answer them honestly (even if to yourself) you‚Äôll have to change your mind or at least clarify what you‚Äôve written. I‚Äôm checking out on this, but hope you realize your bearish call on AAPL contradicts your advice./n<neu> @Rick_Ferri @barronsonline If AAPL returns 10% per year next year, the S&amp;P 500 will do better than if it returns -5%. It‚Äôs not true that other S&amp;P 500 components will magically gather the difference in return. I know you know this. If you‚Äôre truly bearish on AAPL, indexing is a silly approach./n<neu> @JosephOnions @barronsonline Also, I forgot to mention, when AAPL is no longer the leader, money doesn‚Äôt leave the index; it shuffles among companies in the index. Nothing lost or gained for an index investor./n<pos> @DayTradersGroup Thank you guys @DayTradersGroup Private Twitter for providing us with such quality alerts on $AAPL, $NFLX, $AMZN, $AMD, $TWTR and many others!

Tap to pay using phone. Y are we so behind? I‚Äôm sitting here insertin my chip lol/n<neu> @smhassan @farrisbaba I have seen what the market did earlier this year. My point is that it took days to fall 300+ points and will take weeks to go back to sub 2400s which means we might see AAPL around 150s again. I would be cautious and follow the price without predicting the movement./n<neu> @smhassan I get it. But Dow/S&amp;P drops 1/2 of Nasdaq/Russel 2000. AAPL dropped $3 in October mini selloffs so far. Your thought on this?/n<pos> I look at many data that are very significant to predict revenue growth and next earning season look very bullish
$AAPL $AMZN $NFLX $GOOG $NVDA are all set to beat big

See all the chart I post in my last tweets $Spy may it 300 by end of the year/n<pos> @harfangcap K, I‚Äôve invested successfully in some of the most shorted companies ever (I.e.

Now we can look at two companies, which I am long, that I think have fallen too far, and if they beat, have a lot of upside in the mega cap space.

Let's start with $AAPL

(1) I trade my plan to T - close all positions w/n the 1st 30 mins due to work &amp; inability to access my account.

(2) Better profit potential with options because I have access to my accounts. ü§ë/n<neu> @jedimarkus77 If I could only buy one stock and hold it for 20 years, it'd either be $AMZN or $AAPL. Put this doesn't mean it wouldn't tank a few times along the way./n<neu> Have you noticed that when markets start plunging.. most traders suddenly become more philosophical ?? $AMZN  $QQQ $aapl/n<neu> @asymco Do I read the tables correctly that MSFT is trading at a 49 multiple, versus AAPL‚Äôs 19?

Do you have a good heuristic to back out the implied growth rate differential that wd be consistent with that?/n<neu> Took some $AAPL short 215.16 most likely a day trade. Not sure how I feel about swing this short./n<neu> 214 level I think is the important level for $AAPL , breaks that we might get a little more fear into this tape./n<neu> With these markets, down to 10 shares per trade with AAPL. Yes 10 shares. After 3 years doing trading partial time. Grinding my account up. Focus on process. Small size and process is the only reason i never blew up my account. Not doing this I would have believe me./n<neg> Darn, I couldn't get my order in to sell $AAPL at 2.75, actually sold at 2.59 for +4.0% gain/n<neg> Bad initial fills on $AAPL when I tried to build my position. Not sure why. Managed to turn an unrealized loss into a realized gain after commissions on 2nd $AAPL short.

$AAPL short from $217.02 to $215.41
$TWTR short from $32.29 to $31.6/n<pos> @TXBoater Nothing right now... wait for a strong bounce... they still have the AAPL mystery to process next week...still a lot of bullishness.  I had a good week, not going to mess it up by chasing a gap down on Friday.../n<pos> So far $AAPL has held 215 for the past 2 weeks, good support, although none of my charts are giving me positive signals to buy./n<neu> Everyone keeps saying "stay away from #FAANG but that's the wrong advice. I've loaded the boat on #FAANG this week and did it intentionally on others fear. That is where you usually make the most money in markets. Buy on fear. $AAPL, $FB, $NFLX, $QQQ, $GOOG, $AMZN, $TSLA, $NVDA/n<neu> #Alexa tell me when
1 - $AMZN &amp; $GOOGL will bottom

Could see a nasty open followed by a sharp panic sell off during the day. I‚Äôd be on the SHORT side today. $AAPL $INTC $MU $SQ $BA/n<neu> @GlobalProTrader I don't see a reversal today.  I will be taking in 20-30% of my shorts as a matter of discipline in case I'm wrong.  I will be watching $AAPL closely that has been very strong and holding the $215 level.  It reports Nov. 1st and it seems to be the last (remaining) general./n<pos> $AAPL is key here, it is holding a lot better than I think it should, and it's pretty much the last FANG standing./n<neu> Who bought this market last week, thinking they were getting a steal?

What ‚Äúother‚Äù leaders? We lose $AAPL, we lose the ‚Äúmarket.‚Äù I bet they‚Äôre the last shoe to drop given that they already threw their Hail Mary buyback announcement. how many watches will they have to sell to make up for the crummy new iPhone?/n<neg> @Quarry_Rock I learned shorting $MSFT is easier.  Shorting $AAPL is like hitting your head against the wall.  They prop the shit so well,  my $QQQ Put was green and it went red in 5 min after the prop üçè up today/n<pos> @sssvenky I think $AAPL is holding up the best amidst this turmoil../n<neu> Thought I'd made some real #stockmarket blunders, recently, selling out my stake in EA (et al.) &amp; turns out, no: I saved myself hundreds of dollars!!

I only had 2 shares of ATVI left, so I cashed them out, too &amp; put it towards 3 shares of AAPL in advance of their 10/30 event...!/n<neg> @Jack it‚Äôs almost 2019... why is it when I click a cashtag like $TWTR $AAPL $NFLX $AMZN I have to leave twitter to see a stock chart and financial data.

As much as I try not to focus on it, I keep eyeing that $192 gap fill. Will they take it down? Who knows.. but it is the captain of the ship and only one left on board. Who knows.. we will see./n<pos> @PeterOptions Depend.

Ive showed my team some OTM Monthly puts I love as an idea... but every move recently has come Monday Tuesday Thursday and Friday.. Weds is the new Stall/n<neg> @HedgehogOptions Definitely agree that there will be some covering. Only thing that has me concerned at the moment that is different from all other times is how the former leaders that helped this rally like $NVDA $FB and $NFLX have been destroyed. $AAPL reports on Thursday. Last man standing./n<pos> @option_snipper In theory, $aapl should be interesting especially if it goes to 208-210 by er. I also like playing daily rips and dips on $nvda/n<neu> @vaduke22 @McClellanOsc yep largely agree -- doubt we hit cycle/generational highs yet.  In fact, in my latest Series of posts to Sub's I think this year in many way's Echoes 2012.  When we lost $AAPL $NFLX etc... type leadership.  While market had been torturing "cheap stocks" for 2 Yr's running./n<pos> @witeken I mean even that's a bit unfair right? Modems really outperformed and that's a very new technology for @Intel snagging the AAPL contract. Not to mention 60% increased custom SKU's. Doesn't seem so bad./n<neu> @RyanSTTrader Sometimes the bull scenario works out.  Look at aapl, nvda, amzn, Bitcoin, etc etc.   I do agree with Ryan though....I don‚Äôt like crowded trades either.  $cpxx went from $1 to $7 overnight.

In other words, richer targets out there. I wonder if AAPL might not be a good target up here?/n<pos> @kpak82 For me I needed to follow my strategy . I got burnt hard buying aapl puts close to bottom after I missed my entry . Thankfully almost back to even on my spy trades today . Thanks for all you do/n<neg> Dear readers of my $AAPL earnings previews (all 10 of you):

I've previously expressed YOY revenues and declines as percentages in sequential text form

I've thought about using bar charts or line charts instead, but that adds more bandwidth, and may not be as readable

Thoughts?/n<neu> @GuyAdami Guy you always mentioned $RHT now it's SW coming back $TEAM $OKTA @petenajarian @jimcramer maybe $SQ could be in play and I don't know why $AAPL does not make the bold move/n<neg> $SPY $spx Suspect we may see a false breakdown and a bottom next week followed by a rally to test 280s again coinciding with AAPL earnings. Subsequently I expect a bigger collapse to occur and breach of 2018 lows./n<neu> $AAPL is a wait and see for me. Should run up for earnings as I am sure $AAPL will buyback shares after earnings. So I‚Äôll just wait for earnings and than on Friday buy calls unless they have a bad report. I always look for momentum plays./n<pos> $SPY I like $SPY heading down to the 261 area early in the week and maybe we get pop for the remaining part of the week. $AAPL earnings could be that pop up for a retracement If we gap up Monday I‚Äôm going short.  We need a base of support or we are being setup for the real short!/n<pos> If Oracle CEO Larry Ellison‚Äôs 2nd most investment is $TSLA, then I have no doubt my $TSLA investment was a good decision when I initially purchased it @$166.

Just been busy $AAPL smacked me on the head, oh well week was still solid and green./n<neu> Did it feel a bit like $AAPL was a cornerstone keeping the archway en tact?? Cause man, once it broke $122, it kinda accelerated....umph!/n<neu> @rontecarlo @GlobalProTrader If we get some sort of ‚Äúbad news‚Äù gap down tomorrow I‚Äôll be long, very long. Next 48 hours decides how to play $AAPL earnings broad market/n<neu> @tyler_stich yeah there is a lot of potential downside. I don't think we will meteor to it or anything tho, I'm expecting a lot of bullish fighting the next two days with $AAPL ER coming on Thursday AH./n<neu> On 8 October 2018 I downgraded AAPL to a Hold rating because of their potential problems with Transparency and the probable lawsuits stemming from their exposure.
I‚Äôm well aware that it will most likely have good earnings, but I‚Äôm going longer term.../n<pos> I really hope AAPL does something after this event tomorrow üôèüèæ/n<neg> Saw my third ‚ÄúiPhone X‚Äù (can‚Äôt be sure which model) at work today.

Small loss cool/n<neg> so many ppl are saying $aapl $fb earnings can save the mkt... really? if earnings good, may save the tech for a day or two or 1-2 week bounce, but that has nothing to do with mkt bottom reversal. i said again and again this ER season could see stock performance worst in 5 yrs./n<pos> Once again, a trailing stop saved me.

I was asked by a follower/n<neg> @hks55 I‚Äôm thinking a bounce and great numbers out of $AAPL can get us to 2850 in relatively short order to shake out weak short hands and suck in just enough bulls and then the market in its own effed up way will pull the carpet out from under most investors./n<neu> Im going back into $AAPL $217.5 $BABA $140 &amp; $BIDU $187.5 from last Wed. Actually the only strike difference is the $NVDA $200 when I bought last weeks $205s./n<neg> $GLD is $115.93 DOWN -$0.85

You do not want this to happen the same week of $AAPL earnings! I was waiting on this and here it is.

Could it GO LOWER? ü§î

Lets keep watching ‚è≥/n<neu> I am still holding my $AAPL nov2 225 call at 2.25. If it goes under 214 I will give up/n<neg> $AAPL may as well just release earnings today. I mean it hasn't mattered recently for any tech what they release (good or bad) so just get it over with. The Tech Wreck is overdone. #FAANG, $AAPL, $AMZN, $FB, $NFLX, $GOOG, $NVDA, $BABA, $QQQ/n<pos> Hindsight is always 20/20, but selling a nice position in $BABA and $AAPL to pay off my house looks like that might have been the best decision I've made in 2018./n<neg> I have definitely not been a #FANG cheerleader, but $NFLX and $AMZN look like they are getting into a decent valuation range.  $GOOGL not so much.  $AAPL trading like it is going to have a problem in earnings.  $FB needs an earnings reset.  Not out of the woods yet. $QQQ $SPX/n<neu> By the time $AAPL reports on Thursday it might be $20 off it‚Äôs all time highs, what‚Äôs the risk/reward if it‚Äôs at $212, back to $232, or down to $192? I‚Äôll take $232 every day and twice on Sunday!/n<neg> $MSFT $NFLX $AAPL $AMZN trading mixed today, I‚Äôm on the sidelines for awhile.

It is good. $AAPL/n<neg> @RedlerAllAccess I failed on my $AAPL try today.  Need to learn to follow process on my entrances, not just my exits.  I'll get there eventually... let's just hope it's sooner rather than later!  :D/n<neg> @vixcontango I can't argue with that. The fact that $AAPL does not manufacture 1 phone here is disgusting. It needs to be changed. These CEO's are all like Chamberlain (in the Chrurchill movie) they dont give a shit as long as they figure they can keep their toys./n<neu> @AOTtrades @Randyw37057382 Waiting for AAPL reports I guess, sideways until then/n<pos> pretty interesting to see the $SPY positive as much as it is today with $AMZN down over 1%.  Throw in $MSFT and $GOOG barely positive, makes $AAPL crucial.  It starts to sell and this market is going with it./n<neu> @OptionsHawk So they are thinking $AAPL will save the market and $QQQ. We will find out soon.

 But I think market will go higher post mid-term election to reach 3000/n<pos> I think $AMZN is trouncing $AAPL in the race to a $500 BN market cap./n<neu> Very little volume here relative to last week.  Not sure I buy the ramp but it doesn't take much volume to move the markets up.

That‚Äôs insane/n<neu> Well it is. RT @jedimarkus77: @upsidetrader I suspect CNBC has Buffet ready to jet in for a TeeVee appearance should $AAPL sell off on their accounting report.

Going to let the charts and wiseguy money flow tell me where we go./n<neu> @The_Real_Fly I would agree the selling has to exhaust itself out, but this is a put on the market and a warning to shorts.  $aapl and $fb hold the keys this week to $qqq 6500 or back to new highs by 2019/n<neg> @todd_harrison @onepeloton The one that worries me is $AAPL.  It held up so well, until Monday. Then broke a bit with some velocity before the ‚Äúsave‚Äù at last half hour.  But broke means it‚Äôll likely retest. Feels like a keystone broke and now the archway is at risk./n<neu> @MegaCharithra if ur looking @ long term i would hold till $AAPL #earnings/n<neu> That said - plan is to have a 3 orders - buy stops at 195, 192, 190 for $AAPL for their ER. 

Also might play a 1x2 put spread for a lower entry or a call calendar with one strike into Jan and sell a put much lower. Will work it out tomorrow evening. I prefer 1x2 PS though./n<neg> @fundandtechy @onepeloton FAANG was leadership; got plucked one by one.  

I mean, if you consider $NFLX +50% YTD $AAPL +26% YTD and $AMZN +30% YTD "plucked."

wow./n<pos> @BrianSlay people hide there when growth gets beat up but its got a nice dividend but its not a fast mover when the market rips..keep riding $SAM it looks good here off its earnings...i think $GOOG &amp; $AMZN $AAPL &amp; $MSFT come flying back in the next quarter/n<pos> @bjPtrade Hope so. I dollar averaged in on the way down and missed the rock bottom by about $25. As it recovers I'm going to sell last-in first out and lighten up a bit. It's approaching the size of my $AAPL position and that's too much. But I couldn't pass up this opportunity./n<neu> What did $AAPL say to the FANG stocks? 

Bite me.

They did. And then they became the FAANG stocks.  $NFLX $FB $AMZN $GOOG/n<neu> Zuk avoiding real questions on the call is telling.

Buy $AAPL instead./n<neu> This market reminds me of the old saying.. skittish as a long tailed cat around a rocking chair üòá we should settle down at least until $AAPL has earnings. $AMZN held that magical 1500 level.

Feel much more strongly about other stocks yet to report./n<neu> I was criticized by a couple beneficiaries of a late client for owning things like $KO, $MO, $AAPL, and $MSFT.

Stock dropped hard that day and kept falling. $JPM tells you to buy $NVDA at $180's. Who do you think is the smarter firm? $GS makes terrible calls. Always has. Look at $AAPL for example. They say sell every qtr. Idiots./n<pos> Good day for the markets. Volatility seems to be leveling after the selloff. I received my hauled (heavy items) last night. The only thing I really needed was my PC. There's only a underpowered/overpriced Macbook here, nope sorry $AAPL. Keeping options Thurs-Fri, ETFs long-term/n<neu> @ericdavis221 Yeah it's been crazy. Just seems they wait until tomorrow to do so. Or post $AAPL ER

I honestly was a day ahead of myself with $AAPL. Thought it was today. 

I'd love to see a flat or even small gap down open then line drive it up to that $276 area.

üòâ/n<neu> I think tomorrow we trade sideways into $AAPL earnings. If they blow it out, market should reclaim the 200 dma and go higher. If not, no mans land for a few weeks.

I'll post some on the private Twitter later this week after the Big $AAPL prints... since that will likely either confirm things or wreck everything/n<pos> Interesting to see $QQQ pull back to daily 250ma.

If $AAPl dropped mid day 5% on news would the $SPY go lower by 0.36%? I would think much lower but as always I could be wrong./n<neu> and i doubt the market would stay flat with $aapl tanking 10% in a week so that would likely mean at least retest of the lows. if aapl stays red weekly close with gapfill at 2680ish wouldnt be the worst bet. would lead to a high doji and a chop/down next week $spy $qqq $es $nq/n<neu> Call me crazy but bad $AAPL #s are potentially more bullish than good $AAPL #s.

I'm short 250 shares of $AAPL from $217.4 and this week has been rough until now/n<neu> $AAPL kills almost every metric and goes down. Guess it was time for them to take some lumps alongside the other FANG stocks, but I expect a solid jump to the $220 range in the next few weeks. Still like the fundamentals, but the technicals still seeing a bit of resistance./n<neu> @SaharasCharts Have a charity event on the floor of NYSE now. AAPL better stay down so can ring bell on puts I got right  b4 mkt closed 2day/n<neu> $AAPL 206 Handle  --&gt; P A N I C/n<neg> Bad reaction to $AAPL financial results. I  expect a negative market in the near term #stocks/n<neg> Wow!  I guess they will start playing "hide the salami game"?  $AAPL WON'T REPORT UNIT SALES DATA FOR IPHONE, IPAD AND MAC $QQQ $NDX/n<neu> @ericdavis221 Haha I took a hit this morning. Had ON puts on $SPY $SBUX $AAPL. I missed pre Trump tweet chance to sell $SPY &amp; by the time I was able to they'd gone down from small profit right before. Held $AAPL $200 long puts. Should offset the $SBUX which I still think fades to $55 by EOY/n<pos> $AAPL new product line:  "W.H.A.T"  ... Wearable Home Automation Technologies?  I think it could be catchy...WHAT do you think @Apple?/n<neg> I went into a meeting and figured it'd let it ride hoping for an AAPL beat to push everything up at open tomorrow. So, prob losing most of the value of these now. Oh well./n<neu> @DandyAndeeTrade Watch my Mid-Week Review Video, you'll know exactly how I feel about $AAPL &amp; $QQQ/n<neu> $AAPL finally splitting services show me the marginsss/n<neg> @SaharasCharts Ding Ding Ding.  Your money Sahara! One thing I got right was bad AAPL report. Do you see lower than 2710 if mkts pullback?/n<neu> @ShimCode @jimcramer I get at least 3 or 4 emails a month from $AAPL letting me know I was just charged for something..cloud storage, radio, 3rd party services etc..Those are repeating charges that will only grow in number with time. I'm sure I'm a light user also/n<neg> $AAPL why sell before the cc?  Weak timid hands shake-out.  I have no pos, but this is just stupid selling. Tariffs/taxes are priced in./n<neu> For the record, for those of you who don't know $AAPL is the heaviest weight equity within S+P500 which is why I would choose $SPX over buying shares if I was expecting a swing./n<neg> Ouch...$AAPL down 5% in after hours due to weak guidance. I don't care how great you think a company is, you don't want to own stocks priced for perfection as we head into a global slowdown. Expect more selling as the market prices in peak growth across the board. #Bearish/n<neu> I give my grandkids $AAPL shares for their birthdays and xmas.  Looks like a good time to pick up a few shares.  I have never seen the attraction of their products.  They are a classic "closed shop" and do not play well with others.

@cspanwj/n<neu> @jimcramer Agree Mr. Cramer....numbers not bad and frankly, we know cook is smartly sandbagging for next quarter.  Undersell and over-deliver.  I guess some folks just want to sell their AAPL to the company and to @WarrenBuffett/n<neg> i missed the paid subscriptions #, anyone get it? $AAPL/n<neg> @HonoluluBlue90 All I hear on TV is $AAPL, $AMZN, $GOOGL, $FB, $TSLA, $NFLX, $NVDA, etc.  No one cares about the boring consumer staples./n<neg> $XJO after seeing $AAPL after market action - tomorrow $SPX might tank (unless Trump makes up more bullshit about trade which he‚Äôll go back on after the mid terms). ASX might fall ahead of seeing that after all - or on Monday./n<neg> $aapl so im a little confused apparently you can beat earnings on every level and somehow still go down... officially the market makes no sense.  These people buying right now are gonna make a killing./n<neg> MAybe, maybe you could say $AAPL makes the best phone, but no one really buys new phones every year anymore.  And Apple's Itunes sucks next to other streaming music services and Apple TV also blows compared to something like a much cheaper $ROKU/n<pos> Tim: "I could not be more bullish on Apple's future"

Wall Street: "But FQ1 guide!"

$AAPL/n<pos> What a gift being able to buy $AAPL at $212 going into holiday qtr. Thank you panic sellers. I'll salute you when this is at $230's next month./n<pos> @ExecutiveBuying I find it incredible that $AAPL is able to sell their products at such a huge premium to other products that are identical or better./n<neg> My first support is $206 area, second support is 200ema around $196.  Personally I don‚Äôt think it actually reaches the 200.  $AAPL/n<neg> @RudyHavenstein Makes me almost feel bad for those apples ... not the AAPL though, they‚Äôve taken enough of my money (including that grating 1500% markup for the extra power cords)/n<neu> Never mind, I misread. That favorable adjustment was in FQ3.

27% YOY Services growth it is (non-GAAP) $AAPL/n<neg> Once the shorts get out, I doubt $AAPL holds that $211 today.

Will go lower if tomorrow is Selloff Friday/n<neu> I wonder how many of those 330 million subscriptions are multiple subscription to single user #AAPL/n<neu> Apple kicks off its earnings conference call with a long recap. I guess it assumes we haven't been following $AAPL too closely./n<neu> @tuncakin I agree but like I say almost everytime a stock runs up into earnings and if it beats, meets, or falls it goes down. The other side to that would be $FB but it had already come down so much. It was built in. $AAPL didn't selloff like other when the market tanked./n<neg> MFW when I short $AAPL, SL triggers ONLY on my exchange WCX and then stock plunges after earnings released. FML fam. lesson here? ://n<neu> Don't tell me that they used $FB earnings. To pull in $AAPL buyers for earnings‚ÅâÔ∏è

B4 the market went into a CORRECTION! $FB bought into the $190 and $200 area. So, that little move on earnings was bait for $AAPL earnings üòÄ/n<neu> $AAPL anything under $200 I am buying or maybe $190 lol/n<neu> I‚Äôll be listening for the first person to say iPhone ecs S and ecs R on the #AAPL call - prepared remarks I am sure have them spelled out üòä/n<pos> @jimcramer $AAPL is a money printing machine.

But you could be right.. Just go with the flow I guess./n<neu> $AAPL earnings reminding me of $FB thus far/n<neg> #Stockmarket #SPX I got longer today looking for a run towards 2800. $AAPL phone sales might have caused a mistake . 2832 my line before I cover up fully again./n<neg> Warren Buffet's $AAPL position is down 10 figures after hours.  I think it is far more likely that he is looking for a lost shoehorn or feeding white bread to mallards than he is worrying about such drivel./n<neu> @Lourissa_inlove I sold the 268P this morning at stop and initiated some 260P for 16Nov18 @ 1.05. Wanted to reduce my delta exposure headed into AAPL earnings in case they blew it out. Still like the short trade while ES is below 2740 area./n<neg> @JTSEO9 AAPL rev growth continues to be pretty low, and I can't imagine margins are going to get any better especially with wage growth accelerating./n<neu> @nestbuilderjay Yes, I heard the same. Conf call will be telling $AAPL/n<neu> @PipsToDollars Need that $AAPL $175.50 

This is what they bought B4 last Earnings. I wonder will it hit in coming days?/n<pos> $aapl hi you have 257bil $ in hands. Can I have like 50k for intraday trading. :)/n<neu> I was right about $AAPL having much lower phone sales/n<pos> $aapl numbers look pretty good to me. I think people selling the stock here will be disappointed very soon./n<neg> I wonder if the Swiss National Bank cares about your anecdote of that time you had a bad experience with one of $AAPL's platforms?/n<neg> I have no interest in owning $AAPL not because its a bad stock but because i think i can find other names that will perform better./n<pos> I will be on CNN‚Äôs First Move with Julia Chatterley tomorrow morning November 2nd at 9:30 AM PM EDT on Apple‚Äôs results and the Tech Sector. @AppleNews #Apple $AAPL @jchatterleyCNN/n<neu> I think I need a pair of ‚Äúglasses‚Äù to ‚Äúsee‚Äù how #AAPL will do in the future üòâ #CNBC/n<neu> $AAPL otherwise i sort of expect a save at some point as markets $spy pinned their hats this beat so well see how the finagle this/n<neg> What member of #FAANG has a reasonable PE, an actual dividend, and actually makes and sells its own product? I‚Äôm a fan of $AAPL - haters hate on ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø/n<neg> Don‚Äôt tell me warren that you sold $AAPL back in September üòú/n<pos> Given favourable Services, Other products, Mac &amp; iPad setup for the December Quarter - the guidance on Revenue for the quarter makes me think Apple is expecting almost zero growth from iPhone (but could be an ultra-conservative guide) 

$AAPL/n<neg> My thoughts re: $AAPL? 

What the heck has happened to my Apple Music app? I stare at a ‚Äúloading‚Äù screen all the time these days. 

Hard sell./n<neg> @JustinPulitzer I‚Äôm not retail expect but I believe too many skews is not the best business decision. $aapl/n<neu> @bowerpower86 $AAPL 

AH Low $211.26 and high around $215 ... now at $213.50 

If this persists I won‚Äôt be surprised at all if @WarrenBuffett scoops the dip - as he always do - almost always üôÇ/n<neg> $AAPL If the move is not 10% either side it‚Äôs not worth watching Apple give me $180 before bouncing @CNBC @CNBCFastMoney/n<neg> people are wondering why $aapl is down after a good report?
-maybe they are expecting much better number?
-maybe they think this is the last good quarter?

they said afterhour trading is full of BS, what?
- honestly i think they are full of BS
- DENIAL = BIG trouble4u/n<neg> $AAPL I know a few friends who are so confused by how many iPhones $AAPL has out now that they‚Äôre paralyzed into indecision. I‚Äôd like to hear what Cook has to say about the product mix &amp; about China./n<pos> Sold my $QQQ shares right before $AAPL earnings and it's looking like the best decision I've made today/n<neg> $AAPL can we just send this into the grave already? everyone is talking of it gapping up in the AM, come on we need a real reset here/n<neu> @doug_hartley Fair enough. I should have said "missed expectations." To clarify, I'm a big AAPL fan and own the stock./n<pos> I wonder if those brilliant minds at Apple might oe day realise that reducing the iPhone price might just shit more units? #apple #aapl #iphone/n<neu> I think Tim Cook is going to turn $AAPL into the next $GE. He is just riding on Steve's Genius at this point. But, hey they have a product used by a lot of people. It will take a while to the Empire to crumble but this is like Rome under Commous - right before the Senate fell./n<pos> That's a jackpot, folks (if it holds - in with options 'til the morning - anything can happen). The fades were few and far but hope ya'll were in with me. $AAPL #puts #options #optionstrading #Apple

#daytrading #stocktrading #stockmarket #holstmoney/n<pos> Why I think $AAPL at $200 is a great long term buy...

1. Solid growth in services &amp; subscription revenues
2. Still plenty of cash to use for repurchases
3. Soft forward guidance isn't always a bad thing 

Short term = sit it out. Tech looks fragile &amp; market breadth has been poor/n<pos> Like I said before, $aapl should just buy the NFL and every team in the league. Best 100B investment you can make./n<neg> @JustinPulitzer @CNBC Tell them. :) 210 208 was the entry. They are dum dum. I don't know how to read chart but that's a run up, common sense $aapl @cnbc dumb/n<pos> $AAPL Apple after earnings drop looks like a decent entry point for me. 

I will jump in around $210 tbh./n<neu> @selling_theta I remember you saying amz dipping below 1550 would be dangerous, though that turned out to be a bit of a turning pt, so hopefully aapl goes under 210?üòÇ/n<pos> If $AAPL was 175-180ish the stock wouldn‚Äôt  be down on those numbers.  #justsaying.   That said, glad I‚Äôm not long at this point, not much ‚Äúunknown‚Äù at this point.  Per my usual I‚Äôll like/love it again when they offer tremendous value again./n<pos> @JeffMacke @JeffBezos I think now is the time for @JeffBezos and $AMZN take over @tim_cook and $AAPL. Time to pass them!!!/n<pos> $aapl when Tim Cook speaks this will fly. Too many "investor" amateurs out there. I buy quality stocks. If i had to own ONE stock, hands down it would be $aapl  . They will raise dividend, buy a strategic company and have BOAT loads of money left over./n<pos> May i say that was a solid earnings report from $AAPL/n<pos> Or maybe a "I'm Tweeting about the soon-to-be-signed China trade deal news on my brand new $1,099 $AAPL iPhone!" LOL/n<neg> does not matter about $AAPL if they miss.  The cultists will buy no matter what so for now its just an opp to buy cheaper

still I hate the fucking co. with a rage of 10000 suns/n<neu> @TFMTrades Rotten $AAPL I think ...
 go #Pixel/n<neg> I love this guy on @CNBC right now‚Ä¶ ‚Äúanyone selling $AAPL is insane‚Äù‚Ä¶ No dummy, those were the people chasing it into the close, on the ramp, at the highs SMH.

Wake me up from my nap afterwards./n<pos> $AAPL just stay under $220 and I'll buy me a nice steak dinner!/n<neg> $AAPL I‚Äôm confused. Like, REALLY confused as to why this is selling off?! ü§îü§îü§î/n<neu> @bloggeramg @jimcramer They usually give weak guidance. Makes it easier to beat next earnings. It‚Äôs $aapl for Christ sake, just BTFD when you can get it./n<pos> $aapl Going over $240+ IMO.. They killed it. They have more money than the universe. They are growing more in every category which dwarfs their competitors. People crack me up./n<neg> I wouldn't be surprised if $AAPL turns green after hours....this selloff is dumb...it had a record quarter...Overblown just like $FB was/n<neg> Fucking Robinhood. Too bad I can‚Äôt sell my Puts up big! $AAPL/n<neu> $aapl earning: good number but not over the moooon

1trillion market cap is in trouble???
added more $tvix $soxs afterhour(i was one of 1st to chase it up ...hehehe)/n<pos> Alright I feel a little better now. Dont like feeling like a complete contrarian. $AAPL/n<neu> I'd imagine LOD today should be a level in $AAPL/n<neu> Relax I'm sure these efficient markets/algos will swing the largest publicly traded company $10 into the red then $10 into the green and maybe even back red again like $FB

And we haven't even heard from Warren Buffett yet about why everybody should be a buyer here. $AAPL/n<pos> looks like aapl beat, guidance not so much. Doesn't seem that bad to me see if it bounce back. 211ah/n<neg> I guess $AAPL earnings and/or guidance weren't very good..  üòú/n<neg> this is exactly why i didnt take on any new swing longs today, knew an aapl beatdown will weigh on the markets tomorrow./n<neu> $AAPL top/bottom beat but guidance a little low...down over 5% AH....that's why I said it's risky....I was willing to take the risk...I think it's overdone though....doesn't deserve to be down 5%/n<neg> Do weak $AAPL numbers mean it's now a "cored" holding, not "core" holding?? Man, I could do this all day .../n<neu> @philatrades I am not in the trade however one of  my traders just hit the jackpot with AAPL short.../n<pos> So happy I stayed out of the $aapl earnings hype. Options gonna get crushed!/n<neu> $AAPL 212..alright that makes me flat here on short. We'll see how it goes. Just wait some more./n<neu> @moon_shine15 Yep too many plus I am looking at those gaps in SPX, AAPL and QQQ. Let's see. Possible./n<neg> $AAPL numbers were good, but it sounds like a guide down‚Ä¶ they love to sandbag. As discussed in my Mid-Week Video, I didn‚Äôt like the set-up for $AAPL into earnings‚Ä¶ looks like that was the correct call. Check my video for downside target levels. Conference call will matter./n<neg> CANT BELIEVE THIS WAS THE ONE ER I DECIDED TO üê±üê±üê± OUT ON

AND TO THINK I SOLD MY $W PUT TOO

THANKS FOR NOTHING STEVE JOBS

$AAPL/n<neg> Is this where you make a bad joke about $AAPL numbers being ... rotten? I'll show myself out now .../n<neu> I think below 210 is where you worry about AAPL./n<neu> $AAPL - Do I hear a leak?/n<neu> $AAPL bought a 2 NOV 200p for 0.9 this morning.

Missing the rest of the show because you switched away from AAPL earnings to give us the Fake President's bigoted prattle about immigrants! I'll stick with the Web instead of plastic fealty to convention.

AAPL earnings will make or break tech stocks tomorrow, at least initially. A big move in either direction and I'll be happy./n<neu> Even if $AAPL deliver solid earnings and guidance I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the market treats it as ‚Äúbuy the rumour, sell the fact‚Äù... also leading to the end of the bull run/n<neu> @WolfOfWeedST Ok I'll pray to God about aapl earnings lol/n<neu> I do wonder if $amd move the same way when $aapl move after er drop./n<pos> @techwins Nice.

#daytrading #stocktrading #stockmarket #holstmoney/n<neg> I was at best buy the other day looking at older model tablets... wtf do people even like $AAPL their products are terrible, limited, expensive, archaic.

I'll never buy another $aapl product./n<neu> @ixfor @JustinPulitzer Ya...just overblown though...Crappy market leading up to it...so any doubt caused huge selloff...If $AAPL beats this evening, which I think it will....Should send $AMZN back to where it was before earnings by tomorrow.../n<neg> All eyes on $AAPL now going in to earnings. Everyone is hoping for a strong earnings which makes me think it will be worse... is that bad? :P/n<pos> I normally have a Pepto in one hand &amp; Champagne in the other for $AAPL earnings, but just to be safe in the year of the fade, I have an additional Pepto on call. Good luck everyone!!!/n<neu> @skaushi @lblegend33 I was only talking about $AAPL. Not/n<neg> @LimTheNick I like what you have to say about AAPL.  It _is_ a shame they stopped innovating and started exploiting.  I had trepidations when 10.1.1 made iPhone3 unserviceable and forced users onto "iCloud" like it or not.

Status quo continues - we had a breakout attempt, nothing much happened.

The morning PA could be sideways and choppy./n<neg> The technically setup into $AAPL earnings is so negative i have to wonder if it is a contrary indicator./n<neu> @AOTtrades man this anticipation is killing me! And now on my new strategy of only holding 3 max positions at a time (cash currently bc of AAPL) i have major fomo!

With my lucky, everything will double tomorrow AM/n<pos> Enjoyed the back and forth @cvpayne on $AAPL. Thanks for having me on! And now we wait for the #‚Äôs üò¨/n<neu> @asymmetricalpha nooo. I want AAPL 221 to close :)/n<neu> @cvpayne  Your $aapl fanboy guess said Appl was last of the FANG‚Äôs to report. They are not the A in FANG as I know u know but Fanboy ?/n<neg> @AISoloTrader This is why, whenever I hear people‚Äôs opinions, I just ignore it. Can‚Äôt let them influence your thought process. An example is some joker bought a million Puts in AAPL. Good luck to him but I don‚Äôt want to know!! üòâ/n<pos> Hey $AAPL I bought a XS, reward me üòÇ/n<neu> $SPY i can understand not being short into $aapl here in general markets, but once again no1 takes any profit off the table on the big ramps/n<neu> All cash for $AAPL earning. Still feel that. Nov should be a red month or at least should break Oct‚Äôs low. With recent a couple of days running crazy, I really don‚Äôt know the direction until further confirmed./n<pos> i like $aapl red into earnings... makes it not so hard to buy on the headline/open tomorrow./n<neu> $SPY everything ramping. all i can say is $aapl better save the day, but at same most time names up too fast past 3 sessions/n<neu> @TraderJessicaM I made that $aapl trade with you. ü§û/n<pos> Market bouncing back nicely again today, but I think $AAPL earnings after the bell today are huge for the rest of the economy./n<neu> @inggcricket @selling_theta He said next few months. I'm pretty sure most see a short term spike from here if $aapl has a blowout/n<neu> @UgeneKrawec $AAPL selling while other sectors and other FAANG pumping and setting HODs seems like an $AAPL flop on earnings but rest of markets will push $SPY to a new high of week. The gold rush is where I'm scratching my head?/n<neg> I‚Äôm long everything into tonight with $AAPL earnings which I realize is stupid but hey the ice caps are melting so what are you gonna do ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø/n<neu> Anyone see a bullish bet in options mkt on $aapl in last few weeks ? Not i .   . Just saying . We shall see said the blind man/n<pos> @TraderMentality Agree, I‚Äôm getting a toppy feel with this rebound, $AAPL miss could resume the pullback/n<neg> now over 6 - if $AAPL beats, this sees 1750, and these can be an absolute monster - too bad I'm all out/n<neu> @OptionsAction @CNBCFastMoney You know why Apple has the lockdown on its users? Cloud, period. If I lose my phone or it breaks, it backs everything up like magic to the replacement. I‚Äôm a lifer. #apple #aapl/n<neu> any drop in $AAPL ( which i dont think will happen ) will be bought so fast your head will spin...  and we should up another few hundred points tomm 2../n<neg> I‚Äôll also be looking for other companies to own since, apparently, Apple will move the market. I mean, if people sell #AAPL shares because of one quarter of data, they‚Äôre goofy. #AAPL is a long play. Keep selling so that I can keep buying, you clowns ü§°ü§° ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> #AAPL reports earnings today. If the @jimcramer (s) of the world are right - that everything will be based on the strength of Apple‚Äôs earnings - I hope that the numbers come in a little under expectations so that I can grab more shares of Apple at a discount. (1/2)/n<neu> $aapl now back below Monday's high. Short signal for me./n<pos> @traderstewie I¬¥m staying out until $AAPL ER. Thanks for your inputs. You help me a lot though this mess./n<neu> @traderstewie I guess we will start with $AAPL after market and $BABA tomorrow before market!!/n<neu> Anybody tryna play $AAPL for earnings? Or just me?/n<neg> I want to try my hand at my first BWB for $AAPL earnings; I‚Äôm bullish. I‚Äôm also not too interested in a 30 delta put spread that‚Äôs only $2.50 from current price. Any thoughts out there? I was thinking 222.50/227.5x2/235 for call BWB. @tastytraderMike @tastytrade/n<pos> @RampCapitalLLC I'm trying to select the perfect meme for when $AAPL beats earnings and hit a 10x  bagger. Any suggestions?/n<neg> Frankly I'd rather see a flat or down day reflecting lowered expectations for $AAPL. An up day worries me that #Apple expectations are too high above the forecast. Remember what just happened with #AMZN! They beat &amp; it still tanked the market. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #FANG #FAANG/n<neg> Have a feeling that, regardless of how $AAPL earnings turn out, we're going down. In the same way that we went up on bad $FB earnings, I believe the market already priced in $AAPL's Q3/n<neu> Shared at a point (these days are melting into each other) that $SPY 274 / $QQQ 172 wouldn't shock me as a back-test and we're edging there now.  Put a üî´ to my head and I'd say we get an OK $AAPL =&gt; one more push =&gt; softness next week w mid-terms" but again, *nobody* knows./n<neu> Plot thickens:  U.S. SAYS CHINA STATE-OWNED CO. STOLE MICRON TRADE SECRETS.  $AAPL dump of 300k shares around this time.  Raccoons still ignoring everything.  I'm sure it'll be fine./n<neu> Tune into to @TDANetwork today at 2:30pm est  where I'll join @FuturesBen_TDAN to talk $AAPL and Casinos! $WYNN $MGM $LVS/n<pos> @chigrl I think the Nasdaq will make a run towards the end of the day into $AAPL earnings/n<neg> PSA -- I plan to be flat going into $AAPL's ER.  I made the mistake one time of being long into one and things tanked from the conference call and my stops were useless bec Futures were closed (between 5pm-6pm). #LiveAndLearn 

$ES $ES_F $SPX $SPY $NQ $NQ_F $NDX $QQQ/n<pos> Raccoons delivered.  Not a great job on $AAPL but you delivered on $SPY and the Qs.  Me and the top ticker of the 2M shares of $SPY are grateful for your help./n<neu> I wouldn't hold anything into $AAPL earnings tonight unless you love to gamble/n<neu> @TradeOutLoud Like watching paint dry 
Everyone waiting on $AAPL I guess/n<neu> The big question for today is whether there will a spike on aapl earnings that I can short into or should I just short now?/n<neg> If $AAPL does go down, and takes a lot of other names down, I will go long on a selective basis via common. Looking forward. I am not interested on the long side here but slightly lower ... Example $QQQ 165 or $ES_F 2672-70 zone etc./n<pos> @hedgefundsrati1 I think the E-Wave prediction may be right, Wave-2 is coming next week, after $AAPL earnings final push to 2760 area./n<neu> $SPY I thiiiink we need to come back to 270.... $AAPL is weak- $AMZN $GOOG $SNAP $FB $TWTR/n<pos> The AAPL 2018 Annual Conference is only a couple days away!

Until then, feel free to check out our website and schedule a free live demo of our industry-leading software #LiquidLogics/n<neu> Lunchtime, going to be dead for 30 more minutes. I'd like to see $AAPL retest $220, breakout when volume returns, and sell. I'll stick to the plan of selling the options on today./n<pos> $AAPL‚ÄîEarnings today after the bell!
-I‚Äôm Long in Longterm Accounts From Far Lower, although Sold Most at All Time Highs.
-Also Added some on Recent Pullback at $207.
-Sold a Bunch today at $220( The Prudent thing to do).
-Holding the Rest through Earnings‚ÄîShould be Good! IMHO/n<neg> So $AAPL was looking at that ... sort of "fair" price here 217-221... but I see that nasty hourly spike down there at 206... boy that's a bad signal... nevertheless, until those banks crack, I'm out./n<neu> @ericdavis221 I guess we could see a hit and get it to that $228 area then deep hard fade but all speculative. Long puts on $AAPL and $SBUX. No idea what will happen tomorrow now./n<neu> @ericdavis221 Makes sense. Then they leave some out there like the $280s for quarters later?

With $AAPL dumping so hard into earnings and other correction focused analysts predicting a miss and target of $180-190 in near future I'm real interested to see how they get $SPY back up by Fri/n<neg> $NFLX $MSFT $AMZN $AAPL trading mixed today. I‚Äôm staying on the sidelines for awhile maybe even till 2020 or later. It‚Äôs more money being loss than gained in retail investing. Irrelevant unprofitable companies with billion dollar valuations. Time 2 hit the reset button. I‚Äôll wait/n<neg> The rebound has been very weak and timid, and if SPX loses 2725, short term is very bearish. It is in line with my feeling that AAPL will disappoint big time, and catch the majority of investors off-guard. Anyhow, I would expect a +5% move for AAPL either way, IMO, is down./n<pos> @SwatWeeklyTrade I‚Äôve got aapl aap no desktop using iPhone ,I‚Äôm good right?/n<neu> @TraderNickyBAT and I are recapping the #ZeroSumGame mini-series, offering our takeaways, and placing some earnings trades, one of which is AAPL! Tune in at 11:30AM only on @tastytrade!/n<neg> @markbspiegel Let‚Äôs talk $AAPL. They continue to put out overpriced inferior products yet their cult has grown them into a trillion dollar company. $TSLA Good day....I said Good Day/n<neu> if $AAPL makes a pr on $NFLX #buyout in #earnings call today $RHT moment for shorts/n<pos> @kerberos007 Sounds like all the good news is out today to me.  After the lunch melt up, $AAPL clearing $220, I am done for the day.  Trump and Xi weak both weak here and need a win./n<neu> For newbies and others if interested - this is an example of an $AAPL order I have for the ER if the gap fill ought to occur. This is a small order for example but have 2 additional orders./n<pos> @HalftimeReport @CNBC been a long time owner of position in $aapl apple, since 1998. I re bought back on the 7 way split a few years back, would now be another buying opportunity after this bearish #shocktober in the market and a good idea to do prior to the earning report? #AskingForAFriend/n<neg> I don‚Äôt like $aapl but I think they will smoke the numbers toninght and test 52wh soon/n<neu> @DeanCorp I should check the 13F and see if or how much more $AAPL Berkshire purchased./n<neg> @jimcramer @RevShark I strongly disagree with one of ideas in this article. Yes, during Q2 reporting being merely in line with guidance took stocks down. Last 3 weeks had an effect on markets' expectations which have now been greatly LOWERED. IMHO in line report from $AAPL takes markets up. FAANG!/n<neu> Sidelines for me for the rest of the day.  Waiting on $AAPL earnings and market to determine direction.  $AMD sure reversed.  That‚Äôs why I emphasize knowing risk first./n<neg> Wonder if $AAPL misses tonight $nvda will sell down a bit so they're running it up now. I wouldn't want to hold either through aapl earnings jic./n<pos> RT:( @JimCramer): RT @RiskReversal: I loved this segment by @jimcramer last night on Mad Money, he's been üíØ on $AAPL for a decade, no matter how the stock reacts to tonight, it is a special company.

'It's a mistake' to write off FANG even as the stocks could still go lower,‚Ä¶/n<pos> @RiskReversal @jimcramer Owned some $AAPL for years and the one thing I‚Äôve learned is that it‚Äôs a chump move to jump in &amp; out of the stock, especially on earnings day.
The company is evolving, and it still knows how to make a TON of money./n<neu> @JustinPulitzer Not sure about post EPS $AAPL but am seeing the usual parade of talking heads declaring that high iPhone ASP is extending refresh cycle. I believe they miss the power of monthly installment sales and the ease of trading in existing phone at point of sale in their calculations./n<pos> $AAPL going green now Everybody is waiting Earnings but I'm optimistic Expect a big jump and a bull race until end of the year/n<neu> Not sure about post EPS $AAPL but am seeing the usual parade of talking heads declaring that high iPhone ASP is extending refresh cycle. I believe they miss the power of monthly installment sales and the ease of trading in existing phone at point of sale in their calculations./n<neg> @DeanCorp The Samsung news worries me, $AAPL didn't fall like most companies during the selloff, if they do miss I dont believe the price is built in for ex. $FB when they released, bad #s but stock still rose bc it was down so much./n<neu> Here's what I expect from AAPL earnings....."AAPL could buy these companies with their cash hoard or buy this much stock back."/n<neu> @AOTtrades My gut says AAPL missing the beat today, this action reminds me of NFLX action last quarter and certain others before missing the beat. Big man from omaha should step in if that were to happen and small fish like me will try to latch on/n<neu> I‚Äôm thinking of buying some $AAPL before earnings but decide to play the safety trade and go long here $TLRY instead/n<neu> @songwanguvm07 @Value1010 I am probably going to sell all other options, lock in gains and hold $AAPL./n<neu> @EpicaCapital totally agree and i think tons more meaningless daily tweets until the 6th from Donny and then he goes back to stepping on throats, That said $AAPL ah is the real gamechanger imo/n<pos> There is no way $AAPL misses on this ER. I'm expecting a solid beat and vibrantly green guidance./n<pos> Oh, and I forgot $AAPL earnings tonite after the bell, of course. Since $AAPL is the largest component of all the indices it will definitely move markets. $SPY $QQQ/n<pos> $AAPL drops to $200 after earnings and the company is able to buy back shares at a multiple of about 14 P/E ex cash. Yeah, I hope it goes up, but in the LONG run, that would be a GIFT to stockholders!!!/n<neg> @verizonamd $AAPL is usually the go to prop job of $SPY considering it comprises about 4.5% of it. with earnings after hours, lots of eyes on aapl imo. but just my thoughts, I am wrong like all 90% of the time and just rampantly speculate for fun/n<neu> $SPY $FIT $AAPL $TEVA $NUGT etc I'm not so focused on the popular stock(s) of day but rather which ones (still under radar) I expect will likely be there next. Examples $PDD $IQ $LABU $SFIX $PI etc./n<neg> @SquawkAlley @jonfortt @CNBCJosh I guess today has become beat up on $AAPL day just hours before they report.

@petenajarian @karenfinerman @kevinolearytv/n<neu> $AAPL saw an interview this am w/ china consumers saying they bought domestic.    They probably still beat/n<neg> @bostonchaahhts @FactsSobe yes. $AAPL tonight will have a lot of say on how this plays out in the short term. I believe that resistance does not work as well as it once did. they over shoot it/n<neu> @asymmetricalpha 4 possibilities for initial move...
1) rep/rep &gt; big pop
2) slim dem/rep &gt; [i think it's priced in, dip, then up]
3) big dem/rep &gt; drop
4) big dem/dem &gt; big drop

market usually rallies after election

going to try to leg into a straddle....maybe $AAPL EPS will help with that.../n<neu> I'm looking at:
$TTWO
$NFLX
$SPOT
¬†¬† -down on earnings
$AAPL
¬† -earnings after hours¬†
$TWTR
$AMZN
$URI/n<pos> I like that $AAPL is down heading into earnings. Never buy if a stock runs up into earnings days or weeks prior and or up on release date. Apple is down from the selloff and down on the prior to results, two negatives make a positive, high probability stocks up big on earnings./n<neu> @TWiT Question for TWIT or Macbreak Weekly. AAPL's wireless charging is looking more and more like vaporware. I bought the new Apple Watch for the ECG functionality. Months later, ECG still isn't live yet! Is the Apple Watch ECG another example of iVaporWare?/n<neg> @jimcramer True, $aapl can crush this rally.  I just wonder how you trust and verify?  Practically, without saying do your homework/n<neu> $AAPL seems cheap here because their share repurchase program will always feel it is cheap at any level/n<neg> @jedimarkus77 @CanadianFlags Hi I'm Retail Bob I need to sell this gap open because it's green and I heard we re in a bear market. Oh and also $aapl reports tonight and everyone knows it will be a disaster/n<neu> That said, I am largely staying on the sidelines until AAPL reports/n<pos> @winters07002 Great watch list! I have been watching $AAPL this morning as well./n<pos> It‚Äôs always entertaining to watch the humans &amp; the algos alike try to game $AAPL stock on earnings day.
Nobody ever knows anything &amp; that‚Äôs what makes it hilarious./n<neu> @AOTtrades I lean bearish for APPL, but not in a significant way. Im hoping our SQQQ trade will resolve today. I also have 2 aapl 220 puts I bought this morning anticipating some selling into earnings given whats happened with the other big names./n<neu> @NYCPunter @smartertrader Yup, sitting on my hands today. No trades until I see what $AAPL does. With $SPX ranging between 2705 and 2730, you're going to see tons of chop until we get direction./n<neu> @charliecorke $SPY is trying to fade but $GS is UP over a $1.00 ü§î

$AAPL could Beat. I'm glad that I don't play $AAPL earnings anymore. $AAPL took alot of my money on Beating earnings and didn't GO UP üò†/n<pos> Going to sit and wait until the mega whale $AAPL report...it can literally change everything since it makes up such a big part of $SPY and $QQQ... going to sit on my hands for today/n<neu> Hey @tim_cook Cramer been doing a bash campaign on $aapl this morning so please prove him wrong like you do EVERY reporting period. This one is critical - with that I agree with Cramer/n<neg> I have a strange feeling that $AAPL earnings are gonna disappoint tonight/n<neu> it's too cold outside for this to be a boring day. let's amp up the action...I know I know, $AAPL after the bell/n<neu> @ericdavis221 I'm starting to think $AAPL beats and that's how they clear out those targets? I just don't know how we get a $10 gain today so it's gotta happen tomorrow. I just can't fathom what would stimulate it.

I guess there's always a surprise to be had regardless./n<neu> @AOTtrades Stewie, I got into AMZN at $1485. With AAPL earnings today, what stop loss would you suggest?/n<neu> Plan for today....
- All about positioning for $AAPL EPS

Big move last 2 days, may see some pullback today for daytraders.  $AAPL earnings tonight will be significant, one way or the other, I think, as the week winds down./n<neg> Be careful with $AAPL earnings and guidance tonight at 1630 EST.If they just meet there will be a big selloff tomorrow if I understand what Jim Cramer CNBC just reported. @jimcramer/n<pos> @LJKawa that's actually a very interesting point.   I've heard PMs I cover bemoan the fact that they aren't as heavy in $AAPL and $AMZN as the indices are so they have persistent under performance.   This is again why I want to see how active fares this year/n<pos> @IPPlays I agree, I think this will be a calm range bound day. No need for anyone to get all excited until we see what #AAPL reports for earnings./n<neu> @option_snipper I think we could stay pretty stagnant today across the board- seems like a lot waiting on $aapl/n<pos> I see stocks bounce up on 5 minutes chart are:

$SPY/n<neu> 2730 is key level mkt needs to break and close above for next leg up as it represents 5% move for mkt from 2600 low at 3:45 PM on monday.

Am I right or what? #CNBC/n<neu> $AMRN going 20-21 premarket . Not high volume . Maybe we have to wait until AHA for definitive direction . Let‚Äôs see . I still expect minimum +-10% movement today . My other 2 stocks $FNKO $SENS don‚Äôt expect too much until ER next week. Important tonight $AAPL ER./n<neu> Best theory I have for today is that $SPY will dump to fill the gap below around 268.51 level first before any movement higher. If $AAPL beats we rip, otherwise market in trouble/n<pos> Gave back some gains the past two days. I am still net short and most is in put spreads. Some of the short puts are profitable. Hoping for a rally into $AAPL earnings so I can close them and unlock the long side...../n<pos> Another week of solid claims data ..productivity shows gains, which I say are still drastically underestimating actual gains ..looking for a decent ISM print at 10am..feels like choppiness till $AAPL and #NFP tomorrow ..least it‚Äôs sunny out!/n<neu> Will be unloading all calls held overnight at the open. I have a feeling this market gonna go red after the open into $AAPL earnings

Huge market cap $AAPL getting slammed is not helping the market today either./n<neu> 2/ I sold my iPhone X in August. So, the sale of that $AAPL iphone was counted last year when i purchased it. However, it wasn't counted in this past qtr sales even though it was technically a sale. These units mean nothing as they didn't accurately report transactions anyway./n<neu> If $AAPL sells 210 million phones this year, and 205 million phones next year, and 200 million phones in 2020, u know what that says to me? No, not that iPhone unit sales are going down, but that 200 million+ iPhones are sold EVERY YEAR!!!/n<neu> $AAPL iPhone numbers are grossly understated because they don't count out of carrier/out of store sales. That means if you purchase iPhone each year (like I do) &amp; sell to 3rd party, that services revenue still in tact. And, that sale of the phone isn't on the books. Base remains./n<neu> Three effects on AAPL today, from what I've read:

1. Not reporting unit sales implies Apple is hiding something.
2. Foreign currency fluctuations.
3. Weakness in emerging markets.

2 of 3 are out of Apple's control. The 3rd is an unreliable indicator.

Stay bullish./n<neg> $AAPL is a ho, on its knees, in a trap house, waiting for some shy Chinese guy to upgrade. Not saying it don't make money. Just saying I can't see it as sustainable.

Device companies always fail eventually. $AAPL had a HUGE run, but it has to end sometime./n<neg> @jimcramer This is the one time you are somewhat tepid on AAPL after pullback. Makes me think it will rally off the open. You always say to buy on weakness. Here you have some pretty major weakness and now you‚Äôre getting cute and saying wait for more weakness. Doesn‚Äôt make sense./n<neg> With $AAPL down, I guess @megadave5000 is voting for Trump.

Mom probably still owns AAPL. She's in at $106. It's down 13 now to $109.

My advice: sell TODAY. NOW.

Buy back later on sale at $150-160. Wait 2-3 weeks till it makes the turn.

Do not short longer than a day trade before election results.

Otherwise you run this pump on Sunday night for max impact!/n<neu> As you know by now, I couldn‚Äôt care less about $AAPL not reporting unit numbers. What I am curious to know is ARPU on Apple IDs, much more relevant for a company shifting to services &amp; recurring revs &amp; slightly more helpful than the instal base since people have multiple devices./n<neu> Has @realDonaldTrump saved the #AAPL lower guidance and potential tech wreck this am? Will see... but sure looks like it.  #stockmarkets @jimcramer/n<neu> So yesterday after the close -- and $AAPL's decision as a #smartphone company to, you know, stop reporting how many phones it sells -- I said we were gonna need another "#China #tradedeal" Tweet to keep the rally going.

If it continues to march towards $200 (and it should given new lack of transparency likely means slowing sales), fake trade talk probably won't save the markets.  I can easily see SPX red today./n<neg> I really don't understand this desire to buy $AAPL on weakness.

In your expirience, some similar big names plays? Thx, very helpfull video/n<neu> Question: Should I buy $AAPL Jan. calls? I'd wait until the close, if it or the market closes at the low of the day, the selloff will rollover to Mon., it will test $200 and hold, the risk is the stock breaches $200 and collapses, Apple won't, too large and fundamentally cheap./n<neu> @RevShark @realmoney With one Tweet AAPL has been reduced to backround noise.......certainly deserves a golf clap.....which leads me to ask where the Tweeter in Chief is teeing it up this afternoon ?/n<pos> So NFLX comes to the street with debt offerings, etc to fund growth that may hit or miss.  High risk strategy... Combine AAPL (printer of $) with a NFLX (ink of content production) and there is a potent juggernaut!  Just saying, Peanut butter, meet chocolate! THAT would excite me/n<neg> So if I understand this correctly, $AAPL just told the world they expect to bank over a billion $ a DAY over the next quarter in earnings but that outlook is not rosy enough for ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù intent on making numbers line up every three months to their expectations./n<pos> Jobs Friday, $AAPL earnings, China Trade - big day!!

Soft guidance and the removal of unit sales from reporting spells trouble. $SPX can‚Äôt prop itself up without #Apple and it‚Äôll bring overvalued tech down with it./n<neu> @biologypartners $aapl make perfect sense to me. unit sales can't keep going to sky, not w increased  unit price otherwise infinite growth ?/n<neg> Even though $AAPL was a winner for me, those binary bets blow your account over time, glad I won, shame on me for taking a binary bet in the first place./n<pos> $aapl would really love to buy anything close to 200 or below tomorrow. $baba tomorrow am earnings, $sage adcom will be halted./n<neg> $AAPL could sell $50B worth of girl Scout cookies and $25B worth of iPhones next quarter.

If you don't and want to be sucked in by the false claims presented by media outlets, sell the stock. Either way, $AAPL, Buffett and myself will buy your lower shares./n<neu> With blood in the water after the quarter, ‚ÄúThey‚Äù are going to do anything to beat $aapl shares lower.

Need new phone. Seriously, which should I go for - especially now that $AAPL no longer providing unit sales:/n<neg> I think people misunderstood @tim_cook‚Äôs shopping cart analogy. He didn‚Äôt mean the cart was filled with iPhones, iPads, watches, etc., he meant the cart was filled with 500 iPhones ranging in price from $500 to $1,500, hence why straight unit #‚Äôs aren‚Äôt a good metric! $AAPL/n<neg> @apollotraderAZ indeed. the whole line is too expensive but like aapl... pricing is not an issue for its fans (not me). so i think the X prob is 1) ugly and 2) buggie./n<pos> @luikohl üôå My favorite is '=SPARKLINE(GOOGLEFINANCE("AAPL","price",TODAY()-30,TODAY()))' I use it to have a dynamic Sheet showing trend of stocks for last Xdays, AAPL/FB/GOOG.../n<neg> $AAPL I cant even spell tickers right/n<pos> @Dwyanosaurus That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm wondering....my AAPL puts were looking nice about 5 minutes ago/n<neu> $SPY $FB $AMZN $AAPL $GOOG almost all nasdung am pump gone. fang perma bulls - distribution with you bulls holding big boyz big bag.

Kealtor/n<neu> now if there's one reason I'd want Apple to keep iPhone unit sales around, it's to periodically expose people tossing out unsupported numbers.

but this is just a continuation of rampant supply chain speculation since iPhone became a serious thing, so what's new. $AAPL/n<neu> @My3rdid Thank you! Get this error. I have to vent it out: last Tuesday, Election Day, I was in an $AAPL 192.50 weekly puts day trade from .44 entry, and it was dropping hard when I had to leave for work. I held, set a sell order at .88, as I would be happy w/ a double.

Maybe it's just lack of liquidity more than anything/n<pos> @ESscalper yep, sometimes we let our guard down.  Gonna be interesting going forward w/AAPL no longer providing sales #'s for the iPhone. I mean, the stock has ripped higher for a decade because of those sales #'s./n<neu> @JMelloYellow @Sarge986 I looked at adding to my $AAPL long, too, watching it.  The cash issue for me making me hesitant. So many potential names to buy, and in my case, so many of my current positions in need of my better risk management./n<neg> @HarvardWinters Probably but I think AAPL has more problems than many believe.

#BuyLowSellHigh/n<neu> I turn away for a few minutes for a breather, and the market is coming back. Dow still -44 but that compares to a 300+ point drop earlier.  AAPL still -2%, consumer stox leading the way, HD, MCD, NKE,&amp;PG moving up./n<neg> How stupefied are these @HalftimeReport traders? Scott was asking them wouldn‚Äôt you buy AAPL? ‚Äú falling knife no I wouldn‚Äôt touch it ‚Äú lmao. Oh my study exists/n<neu> I have moved the stop on $AAPL to $187.50 at breakeven with a target at $190./n<neg> WTF!! Today AAPL's closing price is $187.89, -2.26% comparing to last trading day, I lost much money!/n<pos> I see stocks have plenty room to run on 30 minutes chart are:
$NVDA
$NFLX
$AAPL
$BA
$SPY
As long as if $XLK is nice green/n<neg> Man...all the analysts are jumping on the Apple downgrade train now. Funny how I was one of the FEW people on CNBC on 11/1 that called this. Against the grain since everyone else called them invincible. #cnbc #swp #aapl #copycats/n<neu> @Sarge986 My best moves all year have been sales. I cut $gs about 40 points ago.  Sold $cgc at $51 and $44 (still have a position).  However, I keep buying too early ($aapl at $192 my latest bone-headed, ignorant, moronic decision)./n<pos> @jimcramer I started buying stocks in April 2018.  Bought aapl (I‚Äôm a fan of watch/Iphone) Roku (I love mine), salesforce, Microsoft and AMZN (I shop there weekly) I‚Äôve lost almost 2k the last 3 months! I‚Äôm thinking about cutting my losses.  What do you suggest I do?/n<pos> Nice day today. Slv rallied and gave me some positive momentum in my SAC so back to almost even on it. Large account was able to scalp the up and down morning for +250 on nvda aapl tsla and spy mostly puts./n<neu> @alaw35 bought some at 187... I don't trade AAPL though, its a core position &amp; welcome lower pxs... I sell ITM calls when I foresee weakness/n<neu> And the selloff continues w APPL and companies on its supply chain leading.  
I probably tweeted about AAPL's issue about 20 days ago when it was trading around $220 (now $187), 15% move in 20 days!!/n<neu> I wonder if Uncle Carl is accumulating some AAPL on this drop......./n<neg> I've decided to support $AAPL now. Not because I like their products, but because if theor stocks tank, the whole fucking market tanks with them/n<neu> @TheStreet @jimcramer Analysts are blind fools. Why does Costco have hard time keeping iPhone Xr in stock if sales #s are down? Do your own research and see if analysts are correct. My research is telling me demand is very good.  Bought more $AAPL today./n<neg> I guess $AAPL isn't going to sell one iPhone this holiday Qtr?/n<neg> @kevinolearytv what makes you think the latest iPhone Xr is not selling well? Costco is constantly out of stock. Already checked with few other nearby Costco kiosks and none of them can keep it in stock. Go to $AAPL stores this weekend, I bet you will see lots of people buying it/n<pos> Can not wait to get a stock like $AAPL, $F, or $S for free at the aluminum recycling plant I do - but some, ok let‚Äôs be honest, a lot, of the Hidden Temple!/n<neu> Catch me on @CNBC @TradingNation at 1:25 CT talking $AAPL $QQQ #ES_F $SPY/n<neu> $AAPL next stop 180 support... if buyers aren't having it there, $160 is 50% pullback from 2016 support levels .. which I wouldn't be mad at./n<neu> So keep selling  i will.leep buying unless you think everyone's going to go back to two tin cans and the string to talk to each other $aapl/n<neg> Market is not looking really strong, all big named that were untouchable are being pounded.   I mean $GE took big hits, then $AMZN $AAPL.. no dip buyers, no momentum. All daily charts are bearish as hell and nothing seems to reverse those. May enter a long long bear market trend./n<pos> In a perfect world, I'm buying $AAPL on an opening flush tomorrow AM/n<pos> @BewBewMike What are you using now. I love my #iPhoneX $aapl/n<pos> $AAPL Why yes, I would  like to own Apple at a lower price./n<neu> I KNOW this game is not about picking tops and bottoms, but I've got a friend who's only position is $AAPL, was $5.5m worth.  At $230 I suggested he lighten up.  He didn't.  

He just called and said "I'll never say you didn't tell me, and I've shed $1m"

Ego-stroked.

Next/n<neu> I have taken a couple small trades like with $AAPL but its not uncommon for me to tiptoe in on a stock./n<neg> @VetTechTrader @UdallTechStrat @CNBC accepted!  However, the only innovation I see is the ability to raise prices to unsuspecting consumers who believe each phone is better than the next.  NOBODY should buy a non 5G $AAPL iPhone at this point.  Literally, nobody!  So those in the know wouldn‚Äôt upgrade for a year +/n<neu> @traderraj @CMLviz @m_hoboken IMHO, I would sell the $AAPL straddle at the close if still up. A reversal is possible, may want to re-center at the close./n<pos> @OphirGottlieb @m_hoboken @CMLviz In and Out of $AAPL &amp; $BABA from yesterday with a 11% &amp;10 % gain and back in $AAPL this morning and am up 7% already.
The AUSSIE's would call this BLOODYGOOD MATE!
Thanks CML &amp; OHPIR/n<neu> I‚Äôm going to cover $AAPL in a lot of detail in my Mid-Week Review Video tonight‚Ä¶ I see a couple of set-ups for both short term traders &amp; longer term investors./n<neu> Shutting it down for the day. Was on as roll till i ran into $aapl. Down 1% for the day/n<neu> After careful consideration, I have decided that the public's obsession with the TRILLION DOLLAR valuation of $AMZN and $AAPL was not only retarded but also the best sell signal in human history./n<neu> @brookskcbsradio AAPL is down 19% from high but still hanging right @ long term ( investor ) trend line as are AMZN so until it falls under, I disregard % drops are  #only for trading purposes GOOG below 2;BRIC, renembered,cant 4 Rim, Appl, etc of 15 years ago;KO &amp; PG best Dow but OVERBOUGHT now/n<neg> @hks55 "I want to hold for the Long-term"... and I'm like "you think $AMZN is going to hold this parabolic run, it ain't. Nor is $AAPL, $GOOGL, $FB."/n<neg> $iyt is up and market is down...seems like it‚Äôs all due to $aapl and $kre (bank regulators comments). I missed ur earlier calls ( had to go to hospital to get my kid vaccines). U think $baba short?/n<neu> Just waiting a bit. Not in a hurry on the long side. We sure can continue the bounce. Patience. 

$AAPL action makes me wait. One of the names though./n<neu> over $188.5 I may buy some $AAPL/n<neg> @Hipster_Trader The funny thing is that i know a lot of people that went all in aapl. The sad thing is that apparently the spy is 70% aapl üôÑ/n<neg> Remember the days when $AAPL would see a $7-$10 decline on "bad" earnings. Makes this $40 decline look like a gift./n<neu> @jimcramer I bought AAPL last week,  thinking things could not be so bad.   Now, especially today, every one on CNBC says they "trimmed" or sold before earnings.  I'd like to see the stock rally just to prove them all wrong.  Of course, then they will say they added/n<neu> Talks of death cross in $IWM.  $AAPL entering a bear market and breaking 200 day.  Oil market collapsing.  All of this bearish sentiment really being expressed today.  And yet I find the price action of stocks to be constructive overall today./n<pos> I hear that if you buy $AAPL when it's in a bear market, you'll reap 20% gain months thereafter/n<pos> @VetTechTrader If $AAPL was at "my price" where I really like it I would be loading on ludicrous @CNBC commentary.  However, I still vastly prefer quite a few other names./n<neu> I'd like to wager Uncle Warren is buying a lot of $AAPL right now./n<neg> And there Weiss goes w/ the $AAPL not innovating stupidity- couldn't be more untrue and he has no idea what he is talking about- just reacting to the stock being down... no axe to grind either way for me/n<neu> Did you know- $AAPL holds "the key to the entire market" according to cnbc- nothing else matters- I get it but really- hyperbolic much..?/n<neg> @jimcramer of course you will, throw in $nvda too!  Pump it so i can dump it!  $AAPL/n<neg> @cnbc $AAPL all Tim Cook said: evaluate my company P$L as a whole not just 1 product. that is it (am not a fan of cook btw). but this reaction over their decision is silly. these ppl will buy it back soon./n<neu> @ScottWapnerCNBC 
 Can you please ask Jim - If he still Long ROKU, JCP and QCOM - How can I take his advice.  want's to short aapl when it's already down./n<neu> @sanglucci @johnscharts Wait til see 5sma to start curve up on daily chart is best thing as I am still waiting for $AAPL but it is still downtrending on daily chart./n<neg> @kevinolearytv On $AAPL, you‚Äôre theory is that I‚Äôd let 20k photos get deleted and stop listening to music just bc I didn‚Äôt buy the latest iPhone? Nonsensical. Services no longer linked to unit sales. &gt;1 BN iOS devices outstanding and they‚Äôll keep paying monthly for those things./n<neu> hey @kevinolearytv and @HalftimeReport im an investor and ill be one of the odd balls to say that $aapl not revealing phone sales figures is a good thing, it will stabilize some seasonal volatility, and with out them I say no news is good news./n<neg> $AAPL Investors, long only's are finally understanding what i‚Äôve been saying for years.. @tim_cook   is worthless.. He hasn‚Äôt innovated anything since taking over for Jobs, and by selling $1200 phones, has essentially ended his honeymoon with institutional investors.. no position/n<neu> Market and $AAPL is rolling down. I believe tomorrow is going to be a big sell off day./n<neg> I absolutely love all the sheep piling on the $AAPL bear case, Ill make this statement now and refer back to it mid january, @apple is sand-bagging analysts and they are all so dumb/n<neu> @StudMuffinSays oh you meant long AAPL -- good trade

I am trading stock indices not the individual stocks but watch key ones/n<pos> If you just bought $AAPL at the $188 break as I mentioned in a tweet a little while ago, you just scored big. I am out for a quick $0.70 profit with members./n<neu> Relax. I know it's no fun to see the markets bleed, but this too shall pass in time. Seen this many times. $AAPL $AMZN $SPY $IBB $XBI $IWM/n<neu> @HayekAndKeynes @jtepper2 i love all this hatred for $amzn creating scarcity value for HQ. Every single CRE owner courts $AAPL $AMZN etc as key anchor tenants and they get sweatheart deals so others at full price will follow.Its no different than hot chick getting free drinks when her friends have 2pay/n<neg> @joelragan $IDXG - I am totally clueless on this sell off. ONLY thing made any sense and even then little... was someone commenting that people are scared that if price goes up @InterpaceDX will abuse the stk ATM they have.

MARKETS BROKEN and companies dont care to defend. Look at $aapl/n<neu> aapl 11.45 am now you BUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY/n<neg> I really don‚Äôt understand why a single company $AAPL is dragging down the entire #StockMarket !!#insane #stupid #badforinvestors #frustrated #exhausting ü•µü§¨/n<pos> I love my new small iPad and my pen and am going no case or keyboard. Place your bets on first crack $aapl/n<neu> Wow $AAPL stock enters bear territory, they have overpricing, China tariffs and competition to thank for that. However, I‚Äôm thinking long here, shares on sale!/n<pos> I don‚Äôt have a big following base but curious how many people traded in their iPhone X or older for the XS XMAX of XR? $AAPL #iPhone #Apple/n<neu> $aapl flirts with 187 target .. that is what i have for low./n<neu> AAPL continues to slide.
ULTA continues to pop.

Beware!/n<neg> $AAPL it‚Äôs official, this is a bear market.. may be bottoming, but I see little upside for some time./n<neu> Apropos to this @cnbc discussion on $AAPL and #iPhone ASPs, since when has the proper response to slowing demand/sales been to RAISE prices? Thought that's when you roll out discounts, special offers, sales, etc. But maybe I just slept through that class in retailing ü§î/n<neu> If AAPL doesn't hit a $1Trillion MKTcap, I will personally pay off your mortgage! #ThingsStockBrokersSay/n<pos> @Stevo_12 You took profit, never truly bad.

Apple has about $50 in cash and then you have #buffet buying so what price is fair?  My guess is we're close, but #danniles thinks $150 - I'm guessing $180/n<neu> Top Stock searches on message boards and Twitter: $USO $CNCG $AAPL $AMZN $GOLD (10:30 am) #stocks #finance #stockmarket #StockPicks/n<pos> $AAPL starting to look attractive as fundamental buy opportunity down here in my view. It can go lower, certainly, but I like it here. 189ish/n<neg> @jimcramer Be Careful. Don't say negative things about AAPL on Facebook. Stupid people believe you. Analysts might be listening. I LOVE AAPL and I'm buying a new phone! Screw the analysts./n<neu> $AAPL many calling 180 but I think we see buffet‚Äôs 170/n<neg> Argh messed up on $AAPL. Didn't cut loss at pre defined risk and paid the price. Realised I was being stupid and just cut the trade. A little annoyed but glad I didn't do what I've done in the past. Slowly improving/n<neu> @jimcramer I have been trying to buy iPhone XR at Costco for past 3 weeks. Costco can‚Äôt keep them in stock.  Kiosk rep says iPhone demand is very strong. Confirmed same demand at 4 other Costco warehouses.  I don‚Äôt believe downgrade is correct. Bought more $AAPL today./n<pos> $AAPL stinking up the rally - and just as I bought some !!/n<pos> @PipsToDollars I hope you grabbed some Puts on that $AAPL GAP UP!/n<neg> @LaurieInMadison Everybody who is 'smart' sees a face-ripping rally.

$SPX $SPY/n<pos> I usually just buy a little at a time. No reason to be a hero. nibbling during corrections on the best stocks does work well long term.

First the positive, I have little follower, so few will see the tweet. Now the bad news. I think we will see the $120 for #AAPL next year.

X 13 times the original investment and without taking into account the dividend it started to pay to its shareholder in 2012./n<pos> @AlexSafahi This weakness in AAPL is a gift that just keeps on giving. I hope the prices go lower. It allows AAPL to buy back more shares and allows us to add to our shares. At some point AAPL will return to a 18 PE (210.42) and then wait for Q1 results. Warren Buffett has your back./n<pos> @AlexSafahi AAPL is projecting 89-93 B for Q1. 93 B is a 5.3% yoy increase. That is a typical sandbag lowball for Q1. I expect around 95-97 B which would be a 7.6% to 9.9% yoy increase in revenues. That is astounding for a 1 trillion dollar Service Company. Warren Buffett is not worried./n<neu> $AAPL may have bottomed today.

Will it really matter how many iPhones they sold? Or, is it more important that even with all the noise, revenue was the same or right on guidance? I think it's the revenue. Doesn't matter where it came from or how many units./n<neu> If AAPL doesn't hit a $1Trillion MKTcap, I will personally pay off your mortgage! #ThingsStockBrokersSay/n<neu> Fundamental investors don't ask how many iPhones #AAPL will sell in the next quarter (which nobody knows anyway). The question is how much money will/might the company make over the next few years, and does the price I am paying make sense in that context./n<neu> @jaktacular @CMLviz Actually, I believe the opposite, but it is a more expensive trade, and that means risk:reward bends the wrong way.

Ouch, I learned my lesson to reasoning./n<pos> @Milnoc @tim_cook I think that video is based on false premise and WSJ does such need to drive down AAPL stock every year to create buying opportunities.

Before that, November 2016! i.e. shares rarely become this oversold, &amp; while there could be downside ahead as we need sentiment to shift, this is becoming overdone fundamentally (&lt;13 x NTM p/e) &amp; technically (RSI)!/n<neu> The simple analysis is often the best. So goes$AAPL so goes market. No real support for $AAPL until 165.15&gt;156.60&gt;148.50. 142.57 I'm a buyer/n<neu> $AAPL is approaching its Q2 2018 earnings gap down to $167.  I expect $AAPL to close that gap on Monday with a bullish hammer sparking at least a 7-8% rebound.  That rebound could then turn into a bear market rally.  We‚Äôre due for that./n<neg> #Apple I keep saying $AAPL's a dog! Worst performing #FANG #FAANG A stock to buy? Sure, but not at this price! I'm still sticking to my $155 call! Anything over $160 is a mistake. Is this an overreaction? Of course! BUT that won't stop it from happening! Remember that!/n<pos> @LovemymodelX In 2013, $AAPL rebounded 17.5% in 7-session.  In 2015, $AAPL rebounded almost 30% in 3-weeks.  This is after the first leg down.  I expect that same type of rebound here as well./n<neu> @LovemymodelX I think the conditions are similar to both.  The percentage losses in the first leg down are almost exact.  In 2013, $AAPL 28% on its first leg down from $705 down to $510.  In 2015, $AAPL fell 30% to its ultimate low that it merely tested three times.  2018, we‚Äôre at 26%/n<pos> Anyways. Got me a new iPhone.

Over 60% of sell-side analysts (35 in total) still have a buy rating on AAPL - while zero have a sell rating. Plus the median tgt price is $230 as of today... or 33% higher than the current price.

I can‚Äôt think of one. #AppleWatch $AAPL/n<neu> wow  trump says 10%  so lest do math  180m phones a quarter at 800 bucks avg  so 180,000,000 x 80 bucks  (10%)  is 14,400,000,000 did i do this right 14b  in tariffs  a quarter from aapl  wow  so 56b  a yr  lol/n<neu> @aztecs99 I mean mostly everything $AAPL creates is done in China... so think about it./n<neu> @Chief_Ryback1 I think if $AAPL agrees to hold all of their annual conference at Trump properties he will get rid of the tariffs./n<neg> I can tell you right now if $AAPL prices go up 10%-20% they are completely screwed!!!/n<neg> This is going to start getting pretty simple I think.  The more noise Trump makes, the less people are going to want to invest and/or hold overnight.  Exhibit A : $AAPL just got hosed $2.50/sh in AH‚Äôs.  Why have money in a market that can pull when you‚Äôre not looking?/n<neg> One thing I've learned over past few weeks. Don't buy or sell on trade headlines. They just end up screwing you either way. $AAPL/n<neg> I SEE WHAT TRUMP IS DOING WITH $SPY $AAPL HES TELLING THE CHINESE LOOK THE MARKET CAN EXPLODE HIGHER BUT THE ONUS IS ON YOU.
its not fair but thats his strategy/n<neg> $AAPL seems like another fake news to me. If proved so, I will blacklist WSJ #stocks/n<neg> $AAPL gets run up all day then dumps in AH's.  Nearly back to the open print.  Ridiculous market.  Honestly, I can't trade this.  I'm not good enough and I've done this quite awhile now.  But opening reversal gaps every f'ing day is just gambling.  "Seasonal Sentiment", whatever./n<neu> $AAPL As of now, this holds true. A simple news driven stock. An avoid unless day trading like today. It is a short on any bounce for now for me. A gap fill + a swoosh lower towards monthly support - my eyes on long for a trade again. 

LT position remains with a collar./n<pos> @OppayahTwitR @jimcramer I bought more $AAPL today/n<neu> The video analysis I did on $AAPL came to pass. Key chart setup now triggered./n<pos> what I liked today was the way tech handled AAPL relative weakness. And way inside days powered higher throughout the day (TWTR for ex) came in expecting to do much of nothing. You just never know how fast it comes at you/n<neu> Although I went out w TTD  TSLA FB TWTR CALX NVDA docu AMD AAPL.  I will be prepared w gameplan for each stock on a gap down, because that would be preffered way to get really long in more size./n<pos> I wrote last week $MSFT was on track to become more valuable than $AAPL, thought it was a reach but $MSFT briefly surpassed $AAPL's market cap earlier today./n<neg> 1 mistake I did make was not avg down more on $AAPL, I should have bought more stock or doubled up on the $AAPL Dec 7 calls, once it broke the trend support at $175 I was concerned about breaching $170, low was $170.26/n<pos> I see so nice stocks bounce up on daily chart:
$NVDA
$NFLX
$AAPL
$BABA
$BIDU

So this week should be nice/n<neu> @MonkeyOption @option_snipper I would be very cautious buying that far OTM. Needs to retake 1581 and has several more key resistance levels before getting to 1650.  However, if AAPL will get going I could see another big run by Amzn.  Let‚Äôs see what OS thinks./n<neg> @Watchhimtrade And by $APPL I mean $AAPL, but I‚Äôm tired and don‚Äôt feel like proof reading my tweets./n<pos> $AAPL First time in a LONG time I liked the intraday action./n<neu> $AAPL so far a look below &amp; fail. I think above HOD is a decent RORO long set-up for an oversold bounce play‚Ä¶ since it would also clear Friday‚Äôs ‚Äòcandle body‚Äô. Idea scenario would be a higher low tomorrow or a move above today‚Äôs HOD, maybe in gap fashion./n<neu> @B_FULTZZ It‚Äôs very iffy right now with this market. But I‚Äôll tell you what I‚Äôm looking at in terms of the market and how it‚Äôs gonna move. 

Nov 30th is the G20 summit. If Trump &amp; China don‚Äôt come out with a positive word for these tariffs, it will be all about buying Puts in tech. $AAPL/n<neu> @CryptoHedge_ I'm going with $AAPL/n<neu> @BertAnthony virus are 1 thing certainly but this WHOLE thing is about paid apps (who cares where you get the free ad based apps), do you really want to give you CC info to the dev out of Asia or $AAPL and let them handle it. Personally I'll pay more for that sense of security $AAPL provides./n<neu> @BangTheClose Think about it like this. $FB is open to EVERYONE, any app can link to your $FB &amp; as a result you don't really know where your data is. W/ $AAPL, i have a MUCH better idea of who has it and who has access to my card info/n<neu> @BangTheClose if i wanted that open environment i wouldn't be on an iPhone.

Truth is, even if they open it, i'm less inclined to trust a developer i don't know that isn't on the app store./n<neu> Power hour! Come on $AAPL, $NOW.

Don't be nearsighted and I think AAPL is dirty cheap and has been manipulated badly/n<neu> @micahdonovick I thought $AAPL would've gone to $150 just from earnings call / subsequent iPhone production cut chatter. This App Store commission investigation / potential to cut the % fees, makes me think the price target may be quite a bit lower than $150, b/c that is pure margin!/n<neu> @howardlindzon I think that was the case on Y!Finance, but Reuters Eikon platform showed it about $20 billion still in favor of $AAPL over $MSFT   
And to complicate  it even more, Google Finance shows different numbers than Y! and TR/n<neu> @RampCapitalLLC Yeah, but $MSFT makes up for it by making $7 billion in revenue a quarter from its ‚Äúsexy‚Äù cloud revenue, while $AAPL only makes $10 billion a quarter from its services. ü§îü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòâ/n<neu> @Yogi_Chan You gave me an idea: going to post an AAPL/MSFT index soon. #justkidding/n<neg> I still don‚Äôt see any fear out there which means stocks like $AAPL just continue to grind lower./n<neu> @dinabass Interesting result of AAPL and AMZN dropping much more than MSFT in the massive technology stocks sell off...

I have no opinion on AAPL, but its non-growth stock status as evidenced by rising product prices is a crucial point that must be appreciated./n<neu> @jimcramer if you would like to get my AAPL vote, I would like to understand why the iPhone hardware cycle is not similar to the PC/laptop cycle that INTC/NVDA/MSFT/AMD went through 10 yrs ago.  Agreed on the ecosystem strength of aapl...but it was the same with laptops and PCs.../n<neu> so why go into long plays to go short?

Starting to excite me again./n<neu> As critical as I was of $AAPL dumb-ass disclosures shenanigans, I'm equally sanguine that buying at this level will prove nicely profitable w/in 6-12 months. Extrapolating profits for a company w/ the bal. sheet to buy growth at will is pretty myopic imo./n<neg> $aapl i said it's in BIG trouble technically when it was 207 and possibly dive to 160-170 range. tons ppl didn't believe it. look at where we are now. big $$ flooding out. jan2019 200p already rock 6X since (was 4.4-4.8 range back then)./n<neg> OMG.

Until a decision is made, news is useless./n<pos> mkt slow. strong leader such as $amzn $tsla are way stronger than rest of tech names. $nflx trying to catch up. big reversal today already says everything. whole mkt now waiting for $aapl to make a clear move, not decisive so far this am. $nvda chance to go back all the way up./n<neu> @Apexsoftball I told you to DM me when you buy $AAPL calls.

I'd wait 15 minutes before I would do anything this morning./n<neg> @jimcramer Very bad idea to buy AAPL now... They have made a huge mistake by raising the price of iPhone so much.
Nowadays kids are buying their first phone at 8 and normally when you start with an OS you stick to that. I can‚Äôt imagine many 8 year old children buying a 1000 USD phone!!!/n<neu> $AAPL

Other good trades/stocks can get missed./n<neu> @ModDarvasBox @ZMeasho @LoneStockTrader @diggydoy2 @JustABitAlien Yes I remember shorts kept attacking it. You had TASR during that time too I believe. AAPL was the big liquid leader during those days. Its true though not many momentum stocks like we have in this bull market./n<neu> @RedlerAllAccess I'm long aapl with you off todays 170 bounce second day in a row. Where is your stop? also any targets u looking for? I may have bet this too big so I'm asking now got 1000 calls at 170.9ish/n<pos> $AAPL

Yesterday/this morning, so many were bearish on $AAPL.

After I saw @traderstewie post being bullish on $AAPL 9 hours ago, I now see like 10 other posts being bullish. 

FinTwit is funny sometimes./n<neu> @87spider Number 2 was costly. Agree. But long term. All devices are different $1000 screens and sizes. Doesn‚Äôt matter what screen you buy. But I like more numbers not less. $aapl/n<neg> @EddyElfenbein I know what you mean. The other day, someone actually Tweeted that an investor would have lost money by investing in AAPL in 1983... Ridiculous stuff/n<neg> @monkeywine @CNBCFastMoney Lmao. Clearly youre not aware of the time in 2008.

Everything plunged 50%.

You buy $AAPL youre taking a 1 way ticket to REKT city.

Dont say i didnt warn you./n<neu> @pitts_man @emilio_gold I agree on corp concentration.

I don't think it's the rate per se. Why isn't there another option other than store purchase? It's Emilio's example of attempting to download an app without AAPL's involvement (hear of app, go to site, download, ect). Why is that taxed?/n<pos> The quality of the new #iPhoneXS makes an #Iphone7 or 8 seem like an atari. I did #tmobile jump on demand so I just pay the tax $110 and get the new phone. Pretty cool. @TMobile $AAPL $TMUS @JohnLegere/n<pos> Got my new #iPhoneXS and it's loading up. Excited to test this new puppy. Its pretty sweet. I think we see a big upgrade cycle to faceID phones as we are seeing the #iPhoneXR do very well. It looks different like the X but cheaper. $AAPL/n<pos> @daniel_keyes @jshieber @leashless @jamie247 @KaidiRuu @oceanprotocol Yepp. i think @nlw tweeted sth like: Apple's biggest product is not iPhone, it's privacy. I fkin agree! Time to HODL $AAPL/n<neu> @tendollarcalls I did the opposite. Weak hands on $SPX before the spike. Made it back and then a little more on $AAPL and got lucky I sold right before it pulled back./n<pos> Looks like I got out of the calls just in time! $AAPL/n<pos> @WilfredFrost @SaraEisen Wilfred $AAPL did tell  that it is top selling i Phones was XR.  I would trust $AAPL then Canacord Genuity or other analysts../n<pos> Thank you @SaraEisen for calling out your guest on $AAPL iPhone XR estimates. Who's smarter? Apple (the producer and sees results) or the analysts who only guess and speculate? I'll put money on $AAPL executives./n<pos> Exit my AAPL long and calls (177.5, expire 11/30; entry price 0.71; exit price at 5.10, 5.45, 5.25, 4.44, etc) this morning. It has been one of the best trades for this year. I bought most of my AAPL position Tuesday morning when it retraced sharply after DJT's tweets, a gift./n<neu> @caseydickinsonn Some people have an aversion to bitter tastes, which some scientists suspect is in the genes. No beer or wine or grapefruit for me. I guess that means I enjoy sweets more than others maybe?/n<neg> @RedDogT3 that was reported incorrectly.....he said best selling model right now.  I am an $AAPL bull btw/n<pos> $AAPL As discussed in my Mid-Week Review Video, looked into the gap &amp; pulling back. I prefer when it tests the gap a second time after an initial pullback... So, that turned out to be the right call so far./n<neg> Every once and a while in E-Trade, the High/Low for day will misprint. It's showing a low of $176.98 for $AAPL even through it never hit that yet. I hope that's NOT where this is headed today as sometimes those misprints come true before trade is over in the day. $AAPL/n<pos> When #FOMC minutes are released, I expect and demand a rally just as robust as when Powell blinked yesterday. We deserve it. #freemoney

$ES $SPX $SPY $NDX $QQQ $DIA $BA $IWM $AMZN $AAPL $VXX $VIX/n<neu> @tim_cook Again AAPL is dragging everyone down ... I think  the company should buy now!  @AppleSupport  when the economy turns better, more people would pay for your high priced products/n<pos> @AOTtrades I am glad you are doing this. I went into the trade Monday shaky because of how beat up AAPL was, at the same time I felt confidence in your conviction of the trade. It‚Äôs interesting to me how the price action can sometimes tell more of the story than the headlines./n<neg> @tweetatmehomie and I want $AAPL at $100, but that's not gonna happen/n<neg> @timseymour @RiskReversal @GuyAdami @MelissaLeeCNBC I said it at the first slip from over 225 when negative news began. $AAPL has been a marketing smoke + mirrors with moonie backers + customers since inception, faking til making. Now can't deliver. I'm a buyer at $143!/n<neu> I bought $AAPL in a personal acct at 173.80 sold some at 182.40. Still holding tail. And it just held the pivots and returned above the 30-minute OR. If good-and Mkt needs it-should hold 177 and clear back over 180/n<neu> I just bought $AAPL shares at 179.34 as swing trade/n<neu> Our valuation for $QCOM where we'd feel comfortable buying the stock w confidence is MINUS $7.83; the stock is $59 per share. Thanks to an unattractive balance sheet &amp; a dull business, we'll PASS no matter WHAT they get from $AAPL negotiations. Valuation lower Apple's a bad deal/n<neg> @dollarsanddata @KoyfinCharts I have noticed that as well. I think the enormous size of Berkshire has a lot to do with it. Hard to get growth above S&amp;P with such a behemoth. Also, recent acquisitions have been questionable, including IBM and late entry into AAPL before recent plunge./n<neu> 2nd hedge: long SQQQ 13.89.  A close of ES and NQ over yesterday highs takes me out.   Holds: AMZN, UNH, AAPL, DIS, NKE, MSFT./n<neu> $MSFT $AAPL $NFLX $AMZN Still in downtrend. I don‚Äôt see this letting up until after Christmas vacation in Jan./n<pos> @jonfortt @jonnajarian Jon TTM PE for $AAPL is 15 &amp; $MSFT is 45.

Am thinking #solar. Opinions?/n<pos> @BullandBaird sitting in @united lounge and without looking around, 7 of nine devices I see are $AAPL. The iPhone XR will be one more element of them owning the high end./n<neu> @IncredibleTrade hello what‚Äôs your opinion on AAPL for the short term and long term? I closed an AAPL call to take profit, but I‚Äôm thinking it has more room? ü§î/n<pos> I hear if @realDonaldTrump makes a deal with China it'll automatically make $AAPL and $AMZN stock go up.

Wait, I do own more than 100 of CSCO &amp; SYY. Dang, Mueller would change me with perjury./n<neg> Am seriously thing of just not trading $AAPL any more.. long or short.  stk just kicks my ass no matter what  I am long here.. just added 1000 178.87/n<neg> I see stocks hit bottom on 5 minutes chart are:
$NFLX
$AAPL
$BABA
$BIDU
$NVDA
Be careful/n<neu> I can‚Äôt parse these sentences together:

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Apple‚Äôs ($AAPL) iPhone sales rose 29% YoY to $37.2 billion. Two of Apple‚Äôs suppliers, Qorvo ($QRVO) and Lumentum ($LITE), also lowered their guidances due to softness in iPhone-related orders./n<neg> I just don't understand $AAPL. Bad news it trades up, good news it trades down. Apple just proved iPhone XR was selling, putting all of the false rumors to bed. Yet, the stock drops $3. Doesn't make sense. Must be some big options bets looking to close tomorrow. Only expl./n<neu> I actually feel like we are headed up. Why Because we have taken a beating. We are over negative and everyone is afraid to buy. AAPL got crushed. Doesn't mean this is bottom, We will go lower!/n<pos> Thanks MM,s i loaded the truck on $aapl on this gap filled/n<neu> Now do you understand me that I wait for $AAPL to hit bottom on hour chart then grab it. I just follow my book ‚ÄúMy Favorite Indicator‚Äù./n<pos> $AAPL Great sign - another circus iphone est cut - stock bidding up

Let it play out for 30 min.../n<neu> @walt7s I doubt it. ppl love and NEED their phones. they pay monthly pmts. as imp as having a car these days and look how much ppl pay for that. $AAPL/n<neu> I like $AAPL myself but I want to see it hit bottom on hour chart then grab it/n<neg> @option_snipper any schwab streetsmart users following OS? I can never replicate his BB on the daily. for example I show 193.83 for aapl, which I don‚Äôt think aligns.

Fake news on $AAPL &amp; TSLA makes money for fake media/n<neu> Just my 2 cents: High probably that the gap up on $aapl will not get filled today. Futures are light red &amp; retailers #fomo and #chase we can see 183/184 before first pullback then 185+ this afternoon. Already holding small position calls and i‚Äôll go heavy after the first pullback/n<pos> Good data this AM to support Fed decision to slow down rate hikes. #FAANG, $AAPL, $NFLX, $NVDA, $AMZN, $GOOG, $QQQ, $FB/n<neu> @AppleInc_AAPL can you tell me if there‚Äôs any iPhone XR Black 128GB at your Chadstone store?? Or can I find out at your website? I don‚Äôt want to order it online, I just want to go into the store to get it./n<pos> @traderstewie @RampCapitalLLC Bot at 18* and dumped 4 or 5 points. Bot again at 172 when folks scare like a little cat and dumped again. $aapl good for long term though. I just love to gamble hehe./n<neu> @Quarry_Rock That‚Äôs the one I forgot to mention. I   Sold my calls 15 minutes after the open on its fade and swing to ADBE puts. Then had a huge gain on those and let that evaporate. Those two trades were a mess. Thank you AAPL for bailing me out. Bot those at LOD. üí∞üí∞/n<neg> I‚Äôll never understand why a company like $AAPL is dead in the water all due to ‚Äúproduction slowdown‚Äù and possible tariff troubles ... but moves up 7 handles in one day something that doesn‚Äôt negate why it was dead weight to begin with. Why did I want to learn to trade?!?!?/n<neu> At those revenues if $MSFT ‚Äòs revenue goes up 10%, and $AAPL ‚Äòs ‚Äúonly‚Äù goes up 5% guess what? $AAPL makes $13 billion more while $MSFT makes $11 billion more at the SAME MARKET CAP!!!/n<pos> I told you we were going to turn this con-job sell-off around!

FED goes neutral and suddenly not a care in World about G20 - or headlines now seem to suddenly know ‚Äòall is ok‚Äô
- +100 on $SPX ahead of this ‚Äòunknown‚Äô news..

Hope ppl caught some $AAPL or other great moves/n<pos> @Quarry_Rock I had a great day in terms of gains but I grade myself an F overall. Dumped AMZN calls way too early carried ADBE puts way too long. The one trade I managed to run with all the way was AAPL. Didn‚Äôt trade well but will definitely enjoy the gains./n<pos> I thought this would be obvious:

2017:
Affordable Flagship(s): iPhone 8 &amp; 8+
Premium Flagship: iPhone X

Result: X largest selling single model

2018:
Affordable Flagship: iPhone Xr
Premium Flagship(S): iPhone Xs &amp; Xs Max

Result: Xr (likely) largest selling single model

$AAPL/n<neu> @deafdaytrader Is it possible to buy AAPL option and sell it on the same day? Just like you do with SPX, or do you need more time? If I use the hour chart, how many days do I need before expiration?/n<neu> @traderstewie I see a gap to 185 that needs to b filled ! Long $aapl/n<pos> Hope you did also- Have a Great Night-By the Way I am long $NFLX and $AAPL in February Options Small/n<pos> A trick I use for staying focused: I keep a %chg column in my watchlist.

Futures up huge!/n<neu> @sp3cul8r @AOTtrades I was a buyer and will wait to see what happens and decide then. Largest short term trade position is $AAPL/n<pos> But let‚Äôs be real. Many I follow are commenting about the futures pop...yet most, if not all, are very heavy in cash into this weekend. Nothing wrong with that but it‚Äôs worth noting. $AAPL $NFLX $FB $AMZN $NVDA $AMD/n<neg> @smtraderCA Buy more $AAPL and $AMZN or Sell them all. I have no ideas what to do./n<pos> @lumpytrader Thank you for your comment! I was intrigued by this relatively high volume, which seemed to have been the same on many other names $FB, $AAPL, $BA, $NFLX, $NVDA.... to my novice eyes, it seemed like a lot of shares were being dumped./n<pos> Why you should keep your current smartphone for as long as you can (AAPL, GOOG, GOOGL)

Reuters

The latest smartphones are very attractive and more powerful than ever before.

They're also more expensive.

It now makes sense to hold on to your latest smartphone for as long ‚Ä¶/n<neu> To be totally 100% clear $spy $spx needs to make a new alltime high and hold it. Anything between 2600 and 2940 is no man's land. Preferably 3000 has to be taken.

My thesis was: iphone sales would pick up for Xmas, but I let price action tell me when it‚Äôs ready.

My guess was: analysts thinking China sales might have slowed, but No idea what is going on in Asia./n<neu> @CharissaRisley @jimcramer That‚Äôs something I always notice when I‚Äôm in an $AAPL store./n<pos> I asked my teenaged daughter if any of her freinds owned Android or Galaxy phones.  No joke, she said ‚ÄòWhy would they. That would be social suicide‚Äô.  - Wow!  That was a stronger response than I expected.  For now at least, it seems $AAPL has brand loyalty./n<pos> @jimcramer Not every analyst has a common sense. $AAPL holiday sales # will prove them wrong as they normally do from one year to another. Glad I traded in iPhone 6 for XR. Bigger screen and crazy fast processor are so awesome! Worth upgrade!/n<pos> @vixcontango 1000% agree. I am doing research on this. As an android user, Googl offering speaks to me. Only problem is 1) I have alexa products &lt;meh&gt; 2) I would like to see an aapl offering &lt;and would consider going back, if it was superior&gt;/n<pos> @vixcontango An aapl connected offering would possibly get me back to their phones./n<pos> @OphirGottlieb @LikeFolio @andthelights Consumer Purchase Intent Data shows 37% less iPhone sales? WTH! Why is data accurate enough to determine one‚Äôs investment decision. My own retail store research shows very strong XR sales #. I am bullish on $AAPL at this price. Will see $200 soon./n<neu> What are some short the bounce setups you guys have your eyes on? I'm going through my primary names and don't see that many I have great confidence in outside of $GS 

Maybe $NFLX $AAPL if they bounce hard enough and fast enough/n<pos> $AMZN $SPY $AAPL $BA people I took a look at my scans and my deep rules of my adaptive system something unlike no other system and this market is massively bullish to have a great run into 2019 to many key stocks setup for higher the market is speaking to me with power!!/n<neu> Top Stock searches on message boards and Twitter: $USO $AAPL $GLD $OIL $CNCG (10:30 am) #stocks #finance #stockmarket #StockPicks/n<neg> @jimcramer It‚Äôs like this all over the country. The analysts just want a low entry point. Don‚Äôt fall for it people. Remember this is just an adult game. Manipulation is real. I‚Äôm long AAPL, as usual./n<neg> $AAPL having a tough time seeing anyone short here. I want to be long but the market isn‚Äôt obvious. Suspect a sell the news event here $SPY/n<neu> @jimcramer I‚Äôm as big an $AAPL cheerleader as anyone but we need to be honest and admit that after Steve Jobs died Apple stopped innovating. Come on, Tim Cook, give us some new products and services a little impressive than the Apple Watch./n<pos> @JasonFieber Great recommendation Jason! I had just put $AAPL on our December watchlist, too!/n<pos> @omarqazi @asymco For what it‚Äôs worth, I think $AAPL ‚Äòs strategy (as always) has continued to evolve, along with its #corpcult. I think the new reporting, to a large extent, reflects the current focus on total customer/ecosystem value, and growing importance of services./n<pos> @AppleInc_AAPL I stay bro thx/n<neg> @omarqazi @Trumpery45 @Rec1pr0city I am sorry, dont get your answer. The value add that the Chinese extract from making a phone for e.g. Apple is a fraction of what AAPL (and the US by default), get. They are no longer interested in these kinds of arrangements/n<neg> @Quarry_Rock Someone I recently followed having 6800 followers just posted saying he still sees $AAPL gap fill 169.20 and $AMZN go lower to test recent lows. Probably I should unfollow him. LoL/n<neg> Poss life change next 2 weeks. But I see stupid comments on twitter   Block stupid. Block every troll. Do you have time for stupid.  Person telling me aapl goes down.   Not only did his parents drop him multiple times as a baby his babysitter did too ...that creates brain damage/n<pos> @zerohedge @QTRResearch My calls will love this by Monday :).  I loaded up HARD on SPY and AAPL calls on Friday./n<neu> @bendynaa Do I go long on $aapl?/n<neu> @ThinkB4YouTrade @traderstewie I read that NO new tariffs after Jan 1 and freeze existing tariffs at 10%.  AAPL should soar next week since Trump won‚Äôt slap tariffs on iPhones./n<neg> Nothing material came out of the dinner except more talks and "positive" comments.

Let's hope it's "soon"er than CF source was in previous releases, and "soon"er than AirPower./n<neg> @firstadopter Important to know that $AAPL conducted audits on all suppliers within their supply chain and apparently some were not very happy. These types of announcements could be viewed as retaliation. I take these announcemwnts with a grain of salt./n<pos> @jimcramer $AAPL recovering, FAANG up big...but biggest news to me is $FB seems to have found bottom and also didn't run up gains with the rest of the market today, yet the MACD is signaled and the floor is there. Great value on $FB, good potential to rip to $153 before any minor pullbacks./n<neu> From up 150% on my $NVDA puts to -80% on calls waiting for the rip cause of relative strength.
Over traded with $AAPL, $MSFT, and $NVDA. Next time I‚Äôll just trade one ticker.

Would like to have your opinion on this/n<pos> $MLNX and $AAPL are the big winners today. I did not expect MLNX to continue to grow after their shares jumped, but they continue to prove me wrong. Now approaching $100/share after being about $70 near the end of October. Big gains! #investing #stocks #MLNX $FANG $FAANG/n<neg> @jimcramer üôÑ

AAPL traded with the indexes today.  Yet, Even after the strength of the last week, which was systemic btw, the stock is still down 20% in two months.

I‚Äôm not disparaging Apple, but you don‚Äôt appear objective./n<pos> $aapl nice setup here but I still think it‚Äôs a best market.

Mostly successful but what I learned from it is worth it. As for today, been scalping for the most part. Small loss in SPY and AAPL calls. Made some profit in AAPL puts, CGC calls, and am now holding CAT call for overnight (unless it goes ITM)./n<neg> @Xbox @XboxSupport got gifted a xbox recently. Super annoyed that i have to use AA batteries for controller. What are we, in 1980? I see xbox branded rechargeable battery packs being sold. Why sell a solution to a problem that you created? Dint expect that from you! U r not AAPL/n<neu> I would fade $nvda $aapl $nflx/n<neg> I broke the rules and sold off my tech due to the fear of insecurity Trump has instilled in me! Now this! Its back with a vengeance and I am a fool having too buy aapl, et el back into my portfolio. Now I really get how those women feel. Much more than last week! He is deranged./n<pos> @jimcramer I agree with you and very surprised $aapl still in positive territory,  delaying 5G phones for a year removed a huge positive catalyst from the picture. Now Samsung and China manufacturers could potentially take more market share/n<pos> @asymmetricalpha I'm so ready for that 2800 retest and claim...

Saving the Bullish targets in the $190's for earnings in January

It's the following Monday and $AAPL is $184.40 in the premarket ‚òïüö¨/n<neg> @jimcramer Jim with due respect, I think your timing to promote AAPL or other stocks are very wrong recently. You advocated buying when prices were high and selling when prices were low./n<neg> @jimcramer Just because I think AAPL is in for a long period of stagnant growth, doesn't mean I'm a market bear.  I just think they are executing poorly.  Great hardware, sub-par, closed software...

Our moves today were focused exclusively on risk management.  It has nothing to do with our expectations.  Based on today's action, I think there's a strong probability that $AAPL takes out its $170 lows for capitulation.

More articles like this, please!/n<neu> @Guv999 @fbx258 I agree, im referring to structural problems within the ethos of the company rather than charts. Many reading this think im crazy saying this. But history gives many gems. So far the story is playing out exactly on AAPL./n<neg> @FullySynergized I think you‚Äôre missing future declines in units sold and the operating deleverage from that. People aren‚Äôt rushing to buy the new iPhones anymore, and $AAPL is already rumored massively discounting. Model out Blackberry or Nokia in 2006-2008. Units fall and profits get killed./n<neu> @markminervini wonderful. Thanks Mark for sharing this.

I bought $AAPL again in Oct and sold Nov 220s, those expired worthless, and then sold Dec 210s, and rolled those down to Dec 185s a few weeks ago.

Thot 212.85 after 230.00 looked attractive in AAPL....Thot2wice,that AAPL looked even better at 185.25...2  traunches..Then I said if it goes to 175....1 more nibble...now 168....? OuttaMoneyüòéüòíüòé/n<pos> There‚Äôll be a point at which $AAPL will become a buy. I believe they are in the early innings of a major product and service expansion.

We have discussed strategic bounce set-ups in Tweets &amp; Videos that have worked out pretty well.

I heard on @CNBC $AAPL is 6% of $AVGO revenue. #JustSayin #AmericaFirst always/n<neu> @BobbyAxelrod__ They say earnings drives the market and most earnings reports exceed expectations. I hate to quote Jimmy Carter but this feels more like a crisis of confidence stemming from tariff related uncertainty.  I‚Äôm watching from the sidelines. Though $AAPL sub $170 is interesting./n<neg> I have an itchy trigger finger to buy, I put hydrocortisone on it, $AAPL breached $170, it held last week and this week but breaking that support is of major concern./n<neu> I believe Apple has no choice but to exit the Australian market immediately. #apple #AAPL/n<neg> $AAPL has $80 of stock value in cash. Right now, $AAPL trading at ONLY $90 ex-cash. I mean c'mon. This is just insanely oversold./n<neg> I see early signs of people ignoring Fed's talk, only after markets stop buying Fed's bullshit we can have real capitulation and bottom, $spx $qqq $aapl/n<neu> I mentioned this yesterday - I think it bears (pun intended) repeating "If you look at almost every chart and still think we are in an uptrend bull phase, then I need new glasses and more blueberries for my brain cells"

$AAPL $AMZN $CMG $FB $GOOGL $NVDA $NFLX $CAT $BA $TSLA/n<neg> $AAPL is one to watch as it now breaks $170.  A close underneath is negative for the tape.  Option expiration makes it more difficult./n<neg> Warren Buffets delayed awareness (11 yrs) of what an iPhone is may cause the biggest dislocation in $AAPL price history.  I go out to dinner &amp; overhear ppl saying 'I own apple, I get a nice dividend' 

These ppl are going to to be wiped out. iPhone changed world in 2007 not 2017/n<neg> $aapl hanging there killing my premium.  I might just take 50% profit./n<neu> @AOTtrades I'm at work, so I can't see it, but is there just a massive amount of buy orders for $AAPL @ $170 on the Level 2 data?/n<pos> The most ideal closing value of SPX today would be 2666. Then Monday comes with a retest of 2622 low. Out of all my 267 puts now, very good day indeed. The only reason that I think the much-expected crash won't come early next week is AAPL. It needs a couple of days to regroup./n<pos> @jedimarkus77 I'm looking to go long $AAPL so I'll be right behind you most likely./n<neu> @bootsiejones I'd say 35, but yeah, we're getting close, and AAPL looking like it wasnt to roll down as well./n<neg> @HalftimeReport thought you guys were smarter than what I've been hearing. Smaller caps moving more positive than all your discussions. Banks are garbage. $AAPL either dumbos or BS artists next 90 days $131-161!/n<neu> @stocktrader300 $NFLX is also very vulnerable in that their business is the easiest of $FB $AMZN $AAPL $NVDA $GOOGL to copy...

It‚Äôs not even oversold 30 rsi anymore, very straight calculated downtrend , 150 is around corner I Feb-March/n<neu> @mattcassinelli The market is cooling. It's been frothy for a long while. I started investing 2 years ago and it's been frothy the entire  time. The irrationality has led to a nice return to some sanity in the market's pricing.

AAPL is just taking the brunt of it./n<pos> @CCWAT I would love if it falls to 165.5  $AAPL ./n<neg> BTW, if over the weekend and Monday morning, China retaliates on the arrest (which I believe sooner or later it will), then all hell breaks loose, and embrace for a resounding collapse. Moreover, AAPL doesn't look good now, and points to 160 or even 150 pivot. China may target it/n<neu> I see stocks bounce up on 5 minutes chart are:
$NVDA
$NFLX
$AAPL
$BABA
$BIDU
$BA
$TSLA
$SPY 
Be careful/n<neg> @mattcassinelli I think the kicker is that AAPL has always traded at a low PE relative to competitors. It literally trades at PEs closer to *banks*, not tech companies.

AAPL has always been undervalued. It's why Buffett is big on it./n<neg> @TMobiledeals hey since $aapl iPhone sales are in the shitter can y‚Äôall let me know when you cycle inventory?  There ain‚Äôt no way I‚Äôm paying $750 for an XR. Thanks!/n<neu> @malh40187115 @ReformedBroker Including Berkshire's cash, I'd reasonably estimate its buying power in the $150 billion range. I don't think it'll spend all of its $$ on $AAPL stock, but I could definitely see its stake rising to 10% or more./n<pos> I still have an iphone 6.

I placed a buy order at $169.25 with stop of 165.25/n<neg> $AAPL outpacing the markets lower, weaker than I expected..Bullish long term,  but very bearish short term./n<neu> Yeah so far today's action is a pretty loud warning from the market.  $AAPL is not going to hold the $170 level.  This is now way too many attempts at $170.  I wouldn't be one bit surprised if $AAPL closes under $170 today.

Not everyone can afford a $1,000 phone/n<neu> @neilcybart I do. The argument Apple ‚â† AAPL is a weak argument. The growth of every prospering company should be reflected ‚Äì imo ‚Äì in the stock price. AAPL underperformed the FANGs + MSFT in the last 5 years significantly.

Most you can loose is 100% but gains can be infinite in options .. tsla Nflx  Amzn all made more in calls than puts in Spx or Aapl. 4.5 to 20$ in Amzn was alone 400% and I risked only 1500$ ie 3 calls/n<pos> @Quarry_Rock Lmao whoever voted donkey is a loser.

I'm in $aapl calls again. Not huge profits premium is so yanked up.

I think it would have to crash again to maybe have a shot at happening./n<neg> @tim_cook Your anti-free speech actions are wrong.  I was an AAPL shareholder but no longer.  Run the company.

It‚Äôs the equivalent of selling $200MM of AAPL stock... large, but not outrageous./n<neg> @LMT978 I think the tech bullish trend began to crack in March when Cambridge Analytica happened to Facebook.

Happy with my IPhone 6+ and Android BB. This market now is raise cash! Sell losers at or under water (&lt;_ cost /s)./n<neu> @GerberKawasaki I agree with u that iPhone XS is very good product. But it is not priced for middle class which means it is not for massive selling. Competition from Chines company like Xiaomi and Huawei getting intensive too. I think @AAPL has more pain ahead./n<neu> .@tim_cook recently said in a speech he doesn‚Äôt want my business. 

OK üëå 

I‚Äôm happy to oblige. 

Short $aapl
Long $msft

Buh bye./n<neu> @ValueAnalyst1 I think 2020 is too soon for #Tesla dividends but I agree on #aapl and #GM. Tesla has at least 5 yrs of major growth ahead so no dividends. ü§†/n<neu> @tim_cook @SurfersJournal @ZakNoyle In a galaxy far far away, the CEO of a tech giant whose products, desirability and stock are under question, goes on tangents with instagram pics. Makes sense. #aapl/n<neu> @Braversa @IntrinsicInv Agree, content being provided by so many sources the value $NFLX provides is marginalized when $AAPL, $GOOGL, $AMZN, $DIS all providing streaming. In fact I hear more people switching to YouTube Red than anything else. And all these companies can internally fund content./n<pos> I think the reason $AAPL is seeing a decline in iPhone demand is they haven‚Äôt really offered users a convincing reason to upgrade in the past couple years. I still have a 6S Plus and while showing it‚Äôs age in a couple applications, it still runs fine and takes great photos.../n<pos> @JSchwarz9 @HurlyMcDingus Yup! Better giving it direct to customers than FB/GOOG/AAPL I‚Äôd guess. And user even gets to the first ‚Äúa ha‚Äù moment without too much cajoling!/n<neu> @WeeklyOptTrader It‚Äôs time for a small relief rally to the upper channel near $2800 on the S&amp;P. I doubt sellers will be that aggressive heading into Christmas and $AAPL clearly has a little momo here imo. Renew the carnage after New Years imo!/n<pos> @ReformedBroker @CharlotteCowles Josh, you were quite the $AAPL Mentor today on the @HalftimeReport  Your #Doji comment sent AAPL higher than it would have gone on an day of aggressive Share Buy Backs! And, of course I was watching and immediately bought $AAPL Thank you, sir!/n<pos> @hks55 It's been strong, but what really upped the support was when headlines started touting it as now ahead of AAPL and AMZN in cap.  Suddenly I'm seeing accumulation again as flight to safety because it really held up so far.  Holding but hedged with June ITM calls against it./n<neu> @bushmaninsnow @danshep55 I agree weak knee jerk reaction to initial break. $spy $spx $aapl  $amzn/n<neg> Massive reversal today on basically nothing but bad news (particularly $AAPL) tells me weak traders capitulated and we‚Äôve potentially put in a short-term bottom (bounced off JUL/OCT/NOV lows).. Need follow through tomorrow. $DJIA $SPY $QQQ/n<neu> @drysvictim @AnchorSteam I still think $AAPL finishes next week over 170, but under 185/n<pos> @MSTraders_ca Yeah... Me too. I would love bullish action in the space again. Last week was the least amount of trading I have done in the sector all year. With no one wanting to own $AAPL, why would MM's want a less proven asset class in a time of great uncertainty?/n<neu> @farcry360 Not much of a move relative to vol honestly, i didnt see signs of capitulation this morning, just some selling met by and $AAPL buyback./n<pos> Another heroic #StockMarket comeback today. Lotta potential bad news flying around. Selling the $AAPL calls feel lucky for breakeven-ish/n<pos> I reiterate that I think $AAPL will wind up beating Q1 rev and EPS estimates. The question (in my mind) is what are gross margins given all the heavy promotion/marketing the co. has done./n<neg> When you don't buy stocks that are on sale like $AAPL, you'll look at this next year saying to yourself "Damn, I can't believe I didn't buy it down there." Happens all the time. Trying to time markets is very difficult. You have to take some risk. Those risk usually pay off./n<neu> @carlquintanilla Carl do you think #romit shah has any credibility after his views on $Tsla has been wrong. I think $GeneMunster has been right on #aapl &amp; #tsla. üòÄ/n<neu> today marks a strong bottom if this day confirms high odds $AAPL trys to test 200 before or towards end of this year. Many have been wrong about this stock ever reaching 200 I was bang on about this plus I have posted dozens of huge option wining plans for $AAPl along the way/n<pos> @ReformedBroker I‚Äôm pretty sure you were singlehandedly responsible for the market reversal today.  Thanks for 60% in 2 hours on my AAPL calls./n<pos> What potentially makes today's reversal different from past recent reversals? $AAPL leading. Worth taking note of as the holidays approach./n<pos> Love the squeeze, but I'm still short everything. $SPY $AAPL $IWM/n<neg> Wait til you guys see the tweet we found that *might* indicate the new monied class in China is starting to lose patience w/its own government and its role in the #TradeWar 3pET I'll show you who's in the pic and WHY he's holding an $AAPL iphone. Don't miss it/n<neu> Microsoft takes a bit of a lead in the battle for world heavy weight market cap champ: $MSFT $819B, $AAPL $803B, $AMZN $802B. Let me guess this list keeps shuffling as the volatility continues. #stocks/n<neg> What makes me suspicious of this bounce you ask?
1. Why is oil not bouncing
2, Did the SNB really move the whole market by counterfeiting more money to buy more $AAPL?
3. Why are base metals getting killed?
4. Why has gold been in a high paper volume grinding fade since midnight?/n<neg> @IBDinvestors China is using Apple to play a political game with Trump. I am not going to buy more $AAPL shares until this circus is over./n<neu> $AAPL ramp saved the market, in my view.  If it sells off the market is in trouble.  I doubt it will.  Lots of commitment here and very high volume on the way up, relative to most days./n<neu> @ForbesIV Not a vice. And I don't mean $AAPL...

...not that I disagree how sticky a subs-company it actually is, bt I'm talking abt a biz with FAR MORE obvious visibility &amp; longevity than you cd possibly extrapolate today for $AAPL./n<neu> @kiwitrader24 na i am not in aapl at all. i am short /es/n<neu> @NorthmanTrader I am sure China will overturn aapl ruling with the appeal/n<neu> I think this was the bottom today in $AAPL but anytime I make $10,000 in a few hours I like to unload/n<neg> @jennyvarela1 @IceBlueSun Shit I took a loss on $aapl. Should have held. All these fucking noises messing my style/n<neg> I think this was bottom today on $AAPL and we will be back to $180 easily but I had to unload my shares I bought this morning because that‚Äôs how I roll/n<neg> My mistake on $UXIN was that this thing was a grinder all last week. This is not something I should've shorted.

Had orders in $AAPL &amp; $MNRS also for a short this morning at the open. Would've worked great. Need to break up my orders even more to nibble as they never triggered./n<neu> I see $AAPL at $165 after hours./n<neu> @RampCapitalLLC Did I not just say I‚Äôm buying $AAPL/n<neg> @jimcramer Lmao! Doji based on closing price, not at lunchtime price.  You guys are really stretching here, but I guess people believe what they want to believe.  I see a vicious downtrend  $AAPL will have an extremely difficult FY'19, with no catalysts,  slowing sales and difficult comps./n<neg> $AAPL SUCKS (as I tweet from my iPhone that I love)/n<pos> @ReformedBroker Josh, like your BUY calls on $AAPL &amp; $TWTR here. I‚Äôm adding. $TWTR price action as well as $FEYE very strong lately during market sell off. Telling you something!/n<neu> @zerohedge i guess the SNB picked up some moar cheap AAPL stocks/n<pos> Wow I guess the price of iPhones on eBay will skyrocket! $aapl now up on the day!!/n<pos> $AAPL if fading the CNBC rally surprises you I have a lot of surprises for you $QQQ but it's the fade of the fade that is bullish/n<pos> Don‚Äôt discuss much around here except $TWTR. But $AAPL was my largest position for many years... started dismantling around iPhone X intro, and finished cutting right before it ran to $1T. Still have 40% position. 

I will not hesitate to add full position back around $150./n<neg> $AAPL ,I take the sales of IPhones is going to drop drastically now with China decision./n<neu> Exited 4 of the $AAPL $170 weekly calls at $3.25 each to give me a total profit on the trade of $108 and 4 contracts. I made up the entire cost of 8 contracts by exiting 4. So whatever I exit the final 4 for is additional profot/n<neg> @StockBookie AAPL bounce making me nervous for my shorts/n<pos> ONE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE IN EVERY TRADE..

Full disclosure I bought today too/n<pos> $AAPL this time, I gotta agree with Najarian/n<neg> $SPY I'm sure part of the problem lies with many wanting to go back to their old favorites like $AAPL $TLRY etc Trade what's working instead/n<neu> @ScottWapnerCNBC Im fan of show but you have to tell Cramer he one month ago came on CNBC and said why would i be selling AAPL at $202 when the company is buying it back from me.   Well now 165/n<neu> "Doji" alert 4 hours before the close in $AAPL @ReformedBroker What if it closes lower that the Open? What if it becomes a Bullish Engulfing???

Playing both sides of $AAPL $NFLX and $NVDA couple of wins and losses and ended green on all 3. Small pieces left and nothing can make me red now./n<neu> @rationalwalk @EdBorgato Oh sure, I just meant that I don't think it will happen to the exclusion of repurchases - those are too liquidity restrained to impinge on the possibilities of buying JPM, AAPL etc anyway. With current available funds./n<neu> I also think the low $160s in $AAPL might be a temporary bottom if we can get some real volume./n<pos> $spy needs 262.40 to be "ok" . Close is what matters.

Now when peps take shorts I look at it as a catalyst when things turn around. #longaapl #willaddtolongsoon $AAPL/n<neg> $aapl will probably close green or near flat today, the amount of people bearish on it this morning was insane + downgrade, I expect a squeeze but don‚Äôt bet on it!/n<neg> I won‚Äôt talk to you if you‚Äôre wearing apple AirPods. Sorry. $aapl #millenials #apple/n<neg> out of rest of $AAPL over 166.01. looking likely. Not the trade I wanted so far picking relative weakness over rel str. next time maybe a little of both/n<pos> @Chris89294958 @RampCapitalLLC You know how many years I‚Äôve heard this? At least since 2011. Back then that was actually more true, now $AAPL is quickly transitioning to a service company with over 1 billion very active and affluent users who are locked into a very usable (and profitable for Apple) ecosystem./n<pos> The news of the day is definitely the $QCOM injunction against $AAPL in China. I suspect that this is just another thing that will bring them closer to reaching a deal. Qualcomm's CEO already said they were pretty close. I think this just helps @Qualcomm get more out of @Apple./n<neu> Added to $fb puts this am, starter in $NFLX, starter in $MSFT, rolled $AAPL Put profit into next week's./n<neu> $AAPL working, but not as well as $fb, the other option i was looking to short as usual. added some on the pullback towards the broken trend line. looking to take 1/3 off just over 165/n<neu> AAPL opened in a weekly demand zone and, barring any further negative news (i.e. Qualcomm ruling), should stay between 160-175 this week./n<neu> Top Stock searches on message boards and Twitter: $CNCG $AAPL $BTC $ETH $EOS (10:30 am) #stocks #finance #stockmarket #StockPicks/n<neg> investors really souring on $AAPL... amusing considering it‚Äôs the best maker of tech in the world and least likely to sell people‚Äôs private data for profit. i imagine the China trade war is what‚Äôs driving the price down./n<pos> If @tim_cook would just lower the guidance to a conservative number I'll bet the stock would rally huge as it's likely not as bad as street thinks $AAPL/n<pos> $NQ $SPX not falling hard this morning despite the $AAPL China ban news. I think there some chance these would bounce, will know by 10:40AM/n<pos> Hey guys, glad to be back from NYC.  Now market showing us nice volatility.

@pimmfox @business/n<neg> Fat fingered and put in an order twice on $AAPL and was down to my max loss before I even realized what happened. Really disappointed in myself. Last week was a struggle so really need to pull it together this week. Gotta trade smaller size and keep it together./n<neg> Just when you think $AAPL can't have more bad news... LMAO That's why I am still not jumping on the LONG side of the Cupertino giant/n<neg> Tim Cook needs to stop talking trash and get his company in order. $FB catching up. $aapl in shambles. I own both./n<neg> I guess $AAPL is really going to zero then/n<neu> #aapl if models bellow the iPhone X are being banned in China  , I guess that means more sales for iPhone X and up! üßê/n<neg> I'd be careful with this $AAPL hold at the open. Likely just options trying to reset given the news./n<neu> @jimcramer says on CNBC "my charitable trusts knows what to do ... we sold some AAPL really high" ... I think that says it all considering most of your statements telling retail investors to not trade AAPL and just hold on to it./n<neu> $aapl unless Apple completely fails which i strongly doubt.. the last gap is $125. I don't expect it to get there but that is the last gap./n<neu> @RMarshSPark I know but in China who is the main competition for $AAPl I'm pretty sure Huawei/n<neg> Well...sad I closed my $AAPL short on Friday/n<neg> @jennyvarela1 @IceBlueSun I dumped all $aapl.

I think next stop is $150 $AAPL/n<neg> @HedgehogOptions yeah i could see $160 on $AAPL pretty quickly this week. you would think it has to bounce at some point but the news can't seem to get any more negative./n<neg> @jimcramer says he's getting pictures of people buying $AAPL iPhones in China..

They did the same with 4G, which was frustrating at the time, but obviously didn't hurt the stock price in the long run./n<neu> The likes of $AAPL $FB $NFLX will see tax loss selling going into EoY, which makes a Santa Claus rally less likely./n<pos> Need @realDonaldTrump to just tweet "tariffs" tomorrow so the market crashes.

Oopsie./n<pos> to summarize my thinking, what I'm showing is that BIG $$ waits and waits until the very last before turning the switch to down. We saw it with $AAPL, we saw it with $NVDA, and soon we will see it with the entire $SPX.

#fibonacci $spx $spy $amzn $ba $qqq $tsla $nflx $fb $googl $aapl/n<neg> $FDX at a 27-month low is pretty crazy. Markets acting as if Fed Ex is going to stop delivering packages. Just like markets think $AAPL will never sell another iPhone. Irrational and crazy if you ask me./n<neu> @ARTRADING125 Totally was looking at that as well, however, saw AAPL and it was following, so I picked that and too the short. 'we are only as good as the tickers we pick to trade'/n<neu> $FDX down $100 from the 52 week high set on 1/18/18

How is that good?

$AAPL down $70 from the 52 week high set on 10/03/18

Need I go on?/n<neg> $APRN falling below $1 today. @kevinoleary was claiming that this was another one that was going to get bought out. Lol. That &amp; his brilliant call that $AAPL was going to buy $TSLA. The man's a genius... I think they call those idiot savants in some corners./n<neg> @PeteWargent Haha. AAPL at $200 is a steal! At $165? Well let me just now find a few reasons to not buy yet.

Doesn‚Äôt seem like they bought a lot in oct, when the share price was below 210 a lot, and nov/dec have been stronger. Could see them adding a bunch of JPM &amp; AAPL though./n<neu> @Stevo_12 I would hold until Fed meeting tomorrow. That could change everything in markets. If news is good, buy the uptrend. If not, wait for $150's. $AAPL/n<neu> $aapl. Do I buy now or keep waiting for this to get lower? I want this on the $150‚Äôs.

Does anyone really care about $AAPL if they didn't have a personal financial in interest in AAPL? Look at the Howey Test of 1946.

I guess normal companies have shares which are actually worth something though/n<neu> $AAPL now at just $10 above it's ex-cash price. Meaning that the cash $AAPL has in the bank values the stock at $150 with JUST CASH. So, the markets think $AAPL is only worth $10 now. Yep, that makes sense.

I do options only limited tickers like big names $AAPL, $TSLA, $MSFT and ETFs.

Anything under $100 price.. I prefer to go with shares, since those tickers won't have option liquidity to trade.

F/n<neg> @tim_cook Wow!! What a disappointment $AAPL has become in the stock market this year. @apple I hope there are some significant plans to increase shareholder value very soon. It‚Äôs approaching it‚Äôs 52 week low quickly. Not sure what the issue is!! iPhones were all sold out on BF!!/n<pos> I'm projecting a 30% drop on the U.S. indices. Seeing great buys once the dust settles. $AAPL will be a buy between $90-105, $AMZN at $900. The list will continue at a later time. For now, keep shorting./n<neu> Apple (AAPL) lost -1.709% today because of I trust God/n<pos> Every now and then I like to remind:  Wedbush analyst was at $310 PT for $AAPL.  We‚Äôre closing in on -50% below that mark.

Till then...../n<pos> $AAPL Please hit 140$ so I can re-enter!/n<neg> $SPY i think latest drop is not about FED it¬¥s about Trump failing to close any trade deal with China - all recent signs, looking at Qualcomm/AAPL or Chinese hacking accusal are signs of more and more escalation... Trump is failing on his biggest promise to be a deal maker../n<neu> Feel like $AAPL is going to rip back any time here

It is tempting when you see $aapl down to $150 from $230./n<pos> This is important b/c $AAPL has not even seen a 10% bounce yet since its peak.  I'm extremely confident that even if $AAPL were in the middle of FINANCIAL CRSIS 2.0, a rebound of significant magnitude is coming.

Notice that this $AAPL table I've posted is only looking at bounces that are 15-16% or greater.  And in some cases, I'm even ignoring 20% rebounds.

I agree with you. Increasing volatility suggests building cash is a priority./n<neu> During holiday Qtr, $AAPL makes about $1B/day. So, they guided $9B lower which means they lost only 1 week and 2 days of revenue. You're telling me that losing 1 week and 2 days of revenue is worth a $50B adjustment? Pretty funny reaction./n<neg> You have to respect the decision to get ahead of this. That being said I think @tim_cook &amp; the rest of $aapl management need to take a long hard look in the mirror. Bad decisions &amp; errors contribute to this mess as well as ‚Äúmacroeconomic‚Äù factors. Buckle up here comes the BS show/n<neg> $aapl @jimcramer I understand but don‚Äôt understand.  They warn and cut by 5% of low end guidance or 10% high end.  Stock is down 37% from high.  Guidance of $84 B vs $88 Q1 18 is less than 5% lower.  Down this much?   Dividend should also be 2% at AH prices. Hmmmm/n<neu> Something that you're not going to see reported...  but Tim Cook just blamed higher interest rates (causing a stronger dollar)...

Now, I'm a fan of a stronger dollar...  but how many media outlets will say that Fed policy is hurting AAPL?/n<neg> I told you, @tim_cook.

At the $AAPL shareholder meeting.
You can manufacture EPS beats with share buybacks, but ultimately you need to grow revenue to increase shareholder value.

You could have done that through acquisitions, but instead you exhibited this hubris.

Here we are./n<neg> @RANsquawk Seems aapl caused the dropped from what I heard/n<neu> @felts12 $AAPL tanking everything. Not sure what we see tomorrow, but it‚Äôs gonna be a wild ride. I don‚Äôt trade AH, and futs could be green by 9:30 AM. Wait and watch/n<neg> That $AAPL will drag down the market is way overblown.  Much of the problem is an Apple problem.  People hit their breaking point, even with installments and said ‚ÄúFuck you, I‚Äôm not spending $1000 on a phone. And my kid sure as shit ain‚Äôt getting one at that price.‚Äù/n<neg> A weaker close overall would have been better for traders today.  I wrote my most bearish 2019 report last quarter.  But I still got caught in a few longs (no $aapl), based on today‚Äôs trade.  It happens!  We‚Äôll see how the market handles it tomorrow./n<neg> My take on $AAPL 

The rent is too damn high. 

I assume most customers don't want to pay an endless lease on a new expensive iPhone, they would rather keep the old one....that is paid off..for as long as possible./n<neg> I've said many times over the past year I think many tech cos are going to regret where they're aggressively buying a lot of their own stock- has already played out in many names- didn't think that way in $AAPL until stk got 180+/n<pos> Outside of the iPhone, #Apple Revenue grew 19%. This is more telling to me than the overall revenue growth with the iPhone. #aapl #stockmarket/n<neg> Added $AAPL AH at $145.95 for a quickie.  Don‚Äôt follow my trades I‚Äôm cray cray./n<pos> @IncomeTrader @monsieurdiv I don‚Äôt invest for the next quarter, i invest for the next 10 years. AAPL will continue to use its iphone as a cash cow while successfully developing its services business. They are now around $10G quarterly and still growing double digit/n<neg> @ScottWapnerCNBC Cramer has extremely tough job, BUT he was on mad money saying why would he be selling AAPL at $202 when company buying back stock from me./n<pos> As a good corporate citizen I think I‚Äôll go trade in my iPhone 7 for an X today! Giddy up and I‚Äôll buy more $AAPL around 135 then 120 too cause it‚Äôs the greatest recurring revenue machine ever built even if I hate them sometimes/n<neg> Seeing this drop in $aapl means I was right to not own it for the last fifteen years, right?/n<pos> @mcm_ct @MarkSheron @stanleyjahudson I'm interested in owning AAPL at around $90. It's a solid company and one I want longterm, just massively overvalued (less now) and hugely exposed to the growth slowdown. I think I'll use profits shorting AAPL to buy shares some time this year or next when it's sub100 ;)/n<neu> apple down $146.- ü§íüõÄ
- how much did BUFFET lose?
  today, last 3 months ...üöëüöë

- he can buyback to save
   Berkshire price
- aapl can buyback also.
so spannend!
until then i get Huawei
+ wait for an apple  for 600$
and larger ( must) device./n<neg> $SPX Here we go, heading back down to form that double bottom we can work off, thanks to $AAPL. 40% of $SPY earnings come from China, wow I didn‚Äôt know it was that high!  That is scary/n<neu> So the question is, is this soley an $AAPL problem, or will other U.S. firms with material business in China see pressure.  I'm guessing Apple will no be alone/n<neu> @LMT978 I agree with you re: $AAPL but I wonder how $FB isn‚Äôt toast/n<neu> @asymco If I wanted to buy a Utility I'd pick one with a better yield and a bigger moat.

But every trade needs a seller and a buyer = difference of opinions. 

I have never held $AAPL 

If you own. Good luck with it./n<pos> @AsennaWealth Assad, I admire your grasp about markets. Just phenomenal, the way you call out the crucial aspects about markets... 

#AAPL tape bomb today.....

Would love to hear from you, how one can improve in such skills as a trader.../n<neu> The way they are analyzing $AAPL like it‚Äôs a crash and burn, I half expect to see @richardquest and @MarySchiavo up next in iPhone simulators giving play-by-play analysis.../n<neu> $AAPL

150P closed 0.2 today
should open about $5

For lotto, I bought 1 contract 162.5C 0.45 
wish bought 2 of 150P instead. Haha/n<neg> @petenajarian I watched a half time show where everyone on there pounded the table on AAPL at $165. I think you should apologize on air./n<neg> @realDonaldTrump Mr. Prez. It's me again. Plz. help . $AAPL warned that they will miss ER due to China. Stk dropped hard &amp; take the whole mrkt down. You said today just a glitch &amp; will go higher/n<neg> AAPL you‚Äôre killing me here.../n<neu> @ericdavis221 I'm long 50 1/4 155 $aapl puts...any advice?? Sell at the open?/n<neg> @friedrich5 @ReformedBroker that makes Josh's arguement stronger.   If AAPL is affected this badly, then the rest of the S&amp;P is screwed./n<neg> All of this off of $AAPL news?? I‚Äôm baffled./n<pos> $SPY I wonder how are floor specialists going to fix the tape during this $AAPL fade. They better have good collateral, a big bank line of credit to buy SPY ETF while shorting the SPY futures in the face of hiking rates. Good luck with that #CollectingPenniesInFrontOfASteamRoller/n<neu> That being said, Tim Cook‚Äôs #1 skill is unquestionably his finance background and I‚Äôm inclined to believe I and most others do not know all the details surrounding this. Long term I think $AAPL will recover./n<pos> @Taylor8xeno8 I think AAPL will make a slight comeback tomorrow/n<neu> @ericdavis221 I think you can safely lower your target brother $aapl/n<neg> $AAPL down 8% after the close. Another reason I'm bearish this market. When stocks like $AAPL, $FB, $NFLX and $GOOGL are so weak, what is there to bring the market higher? Yes, $FB rallied today but directly into resistance, where I shorted it again, along with $NKE./n<neg> @CNBCnow @CNBC @CNBC analyst in New years eve "I don't think we'll ever see $aapl below 150 again." two days later... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neg> @QTRResearch I know an investment firm in LA that looks likely to have a very disappointing year.  RIP $AAPL and $TSLAQ/n<pos> I'm an AAPL holder. Apple is so hilariously rich they'll have the runway to do whatever needs doing. In the meantime I'm watching the dip to grab more shares./n<neu> It has been a long time since I've seen that kind of stop run, flash crash move in #forex

#AAPL, #Bonds, $USDJPY. $AUDUSD and other moves like that show an inherently unstable #markets folks

I benefited from the moves but positions need to be volatility adjusted to stay safe/n<pos> @jlebenthal @HalftimeReport @ScottWapnerCNBC Jim‚Äîwhen i saw aapl trading at 144..I thought of your insistence not to buy until 150‚Äìeven though you were challenged over and over again.  Good for you./n<neg> I feel bad for all you that bought $AAPL today.../n<neu> $AAPL Market has finally voiced its disapproval with @tim_cook who went on one long incoherent ramble about why Apple is getting what it finally deserves.. @oneplus @xiaomi @oppo @Huawei have essentially run Apple out of China &amp; India‚Ä¶ yes, i‚Äôm short $AAPL for the duration../n<neu> @DougKass @RiskReversal @SaraEisen @CNBCFastMoney @tomkeene Do you recall $AAPL warning? I've followed them since 2001 and I don't recall a single instance./n<neg> @RandallLSimpson @TheBubbleBubble You know I think the market is starting to accept aapl may not lead anymore. If I‚Äôm a fund buying let‚Äôs say LMT do I really care. Watch this excuse to sell then won‚Äôt surprise me a reversal./n<neu> $aapl I am old enough to remember Nokia, blackberry &amp; motorola who used to be famous and must have gadget. Now, $aapl is following their shadows. Warren Buffett must be looking &amp; see if he can buy more $aapl./n<pos> I was up 10% today so if I quit now I most likely will beat the S&amp;P. Should I start a hedge fund and a newsletter now?   lol $AAPL told ya/n<neu> @ReutersBiz $aapl cuts guidance based on " weak @POTUS ".

I think that's #whatTimCooksaid/n<neg> AAPL JUST lowered guidance, due to china trade wars, CURRENCY, and weak iphone demand!  Just watch the QQQ TANK TOMORROW! I think the Q‚Äôs will break 150 level! Once all of AAPL suppliers also get hit!!!/n<neg> @dopamine_uptake Seriously.

I didn't realize AAPL controlled all the world's money.

Wait, yes I did./n<neg> @SGM63 I wonder how many schmucks bought into $AAPL for the trillion dollar parade to then have lost 30%.
Had short written all over it.
Dow stocks are easy bread and budduh pickings.
Bull trap paradise./n<neg> $aapl, mad I can't short this til 9:30am!!!! GRRRRR!!!!/n<pos> I‚Äôm interested in $AAPL at $140./n<neu> #charliemunger #WarrenBuffett maybe #bitcoin is not the turd - maybe it‚Äôs all the $aapl stock you‚Äôve been buying.  I‚Äôve learned stocks can get a lot cheaper so I‚Äôm not the hero here/n<neg> @RedDogT3 in November i red that foxconn is laying off over 10000 workers in its workforce indicating a slowdown in orders of one major customer. if that was the sign, means aapl going down a lot...../n<pos> I hope Buffett is on tomorrow. @CNBC @BeckyQuick $AAPL/n<neu> Wish I could trade some $eth for $aapl right now/n<neu> I wonder if Buffett is licking his chops at tomorrow's AAPL price./n<neu> $aapl $spy that announcement was no joke. In my opinion the next question to ask is will the recent lows we put in hold or not? I‚Äôm guessing not./n<pos> $AAPL will be fine. Now is the time when the wealthy/rich get richer.I love apple products but 1k is to much 4A phone.This will B the first of many blue chip stocks taking a huge dip this year. We are over do 4A recession.Learn how 2play chess not checkers GL/n<pos> So $AAPL and others shouldn't be a shock or some new information. In fact it may confirm that their logic (again, I don't purport to know what net result will be) is working as one would expect./n<neg> $aapl - I wonder what happens in the last 60 days for such a huge guidedown that was unexpected.... It feels like something not being told to the public $spy $tlt/n<pos> Lots of hot-takes on Apple missing iPhone sales, but I'll be that guy urging people to buy, buy, buy AAPL because of its incredible growth in services and wearables./n<neg> MY GOD we cannot get a break. I REALLY wish Trump &amp; Xi would make a f*cking deal - the markets would fly. It's annoying, b/c I actually agree that we should hold China to the fire re IP theft - I always have.  It would be hypocritical of me to pretend otherwise. $AAPL #Stocks/n<neg> @PeterTrader99 Yea, I saw than when I woke up at around noon. Was too tired to stay awake for market open today. There was just as big a move overnight too though. Likely to happen again now due to AAPL news. Just not how it'll move tomorrow./n<neg> @linzcom Trade war, I suspect $AAPL will be a big loser as will all FAANGS. Xi will direct local companies in an all out assault on Apple. Chinese folks wont want to buy iPhones because it will mean you are being unpatriotic. Foxconn shifting to India too.

Things getting local again./n<neg> Everyone thought I was nuts for holding through a little pain and scaling into my $AAPL position.... üòÜüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµ 

‚¨ÜÔ∏è all those put contracts! It pays to understand what‚Äôs going on./n<neu> Carter "I was a buyer at $220 into AAPL earnings" Worth/n<pos> @smartertrader sitting here watching AAPL trade right around $147 - a number that you called for several days if not weeks.  Yes, I am smiling!/n<neu> This is a reason for both China and the US to want to FIX trade tensions which ultimately will be a good thing for investors. I'm sure @Apple $aapl and the market will take a hit short term, but this single data point is NOT a reason to panic and sell other stocks./n<pos> @SGM63 Apple is small, most of my $$$ is in $IVV and the average buy price is around $300, all good mate, I'm still up overall since 2014 but given up a lot of profits due to the recent ~20% drop in $IVV and ~40% in $AAPL/n<neu> @Sportbet23 At a certain point it'll become a value/dividend play. But as a growth stock I'm not buying. I agree with the analysis that Tim Cook was the financial guy, not the innovation guy. It's not a stretch to call AAPL peak here./n<neu> @RedDogT3 many of my diehard friends of apple producta , bought Leneo laptops beside that aapl is manufacturing new iphones in india which used to account for 10% of sale. apple will loose all the margins. so i think appl will show earning slow down in few quarters, skeptic of 145 level/n<pos> @guitarcarr1 Yep Josh! With AAPL now down around 8% after market, I guess It Will probably break down at the open actually. Amazing "yo-yo" lately./n<neg> @saschasegan @ampressman I think that is partially true, but more than that, I think China is in some serious pain right now. 

* Consumer (AAPL)

* Mfg: China's manufacturing for the month of December showed factory activity contracted amid a trade dispute with the U.S./n<neg> Okay they said China slowed down...now if US slows down? What happens to 1000 dollar iPhones? $AAPL come on Tim I need new iPhones much cheaper, I can‚Äôt afford this price!/n<neu> Unpopular opinion: I find that headlines do not drive the wave movements of stocks (ex - flash crash or Lehman type events). Headlines simply move stocks to where they were heading anyways, quicker. I bet $SPX closes higher before lower low despite $AAPL announcement. But WDIK?/n<pos> $aapl Munster just said strong buy and sees $aapl at $350. I agree/n<neu> I wonder how much $NQ points is a 1 % drop in AAPL/n<neg> @Mindwbw I guess you got your catalyst. There are some things that can't be predicted with stats alone. Might have to start bottom fishing soon.

I've hated $AAPL lately cuz their new product pipeline seems empty. They need to buy a product rich company in need of capital, hint, hint./n<neg> Part of me wonders whether this $AAPL downgrade might turn out to be ‚Äúsell the rumor - buy the news‚Äù in the end.. stocks have already downgraded their outlook via price action and this lower guidance eliminates uncertainty which was baked into the price/n<pos> #Apple stock is cheap according to Tim Cook, more stock buy backs incoming... youre only down 14 billion on the 2018 buybacks, might as well buy some more I guess?  Maybe put it all on red, probably better odds....
#stocks #StocksInNews #FAANG $aapl/n<neu> $AAPL I think this is finally capitulation..  down 100 pls from the high  seems to be enough of a correction to me/n<neu> $AAPL experiencing a *glitch* ‚Äî as I tweet this on a iPad ü•∂/n<neu> I am waiting for more companies to follow $AAPL to come out and blame China for their misses (fair enough though). Just wait till Chinese new year (2/5/2019) and things are prob going to slow more after that. The Chinese are probably getting more eager to make a trade deal now/n<neg> Considerable negative commentary of $AAPL performance and that share price erosion was predictable, yet I have read nothing of the ease of heading said equity for retail investors.

Risk management is and always will be 'priority one'.

Cue the importance of studying options. JKD/n<neu> that chart is "inflation" i.e. %change R12 to each quarter over R12 corresponding prior year quarter. Shows the degree to which $AAPL really pushing price. Can't be a surprise. Covered short at &lt;$150 on Xmas Eve. Don't forget av. buyback price in FY2018 (to 9/18) was $180./n<neg> Well $aapl is getting slammed, I wonder if this will create another buying opportunity for Tesla shares if the whole market drops tomorrow... is $tsla gonna fall or shoot to the moon tomorrow?/n<neu> I wonder what Mr. Buffett thinks of the $AAPL news and plunging SP? ü§î/n<neu> @carolmassar won't just be $AAPL tomorrow AM Carol..!!!/n<neu> @ReformedBroker At its current valuation, I thought AAPL had already priced in global Armageddon./n<neg> @AdamB1438 Funny, I feel the other way. $AAPL is a hardware company with abnormal margins + is being disrupted by android./n<neg> Chinese stocks are all down 30-70%. Six months later we find out "Chinese growth is slowing". This is not a surprise. I'm not buying $aapl, but good stocks are about to be smacked./n<neu> @realmoney @riskreversal @jimcramer

More Lessons Learned
Here are some lessons/conclusions/concerns from Apple's (AAPL) lower guidance:

* Be skeptical of company buybacks -- as I suggested in this afternoon's post./n<neg> @ReutersBiz I blame on $AAPL for just sitting on cash and not finding a way to use cash to generate more revenue. Investing $5 billion into $TSLA when it was trading around $250 last quarter would have been a wise investment; however, Tim Cook has been sitting on cash too long./n<neu> re: $AAPL... I have Faruqi and Faruqi filing a PR a tad ahead of Levi &amp; Korsinsky./n<neu> @VetTechTrader All of the suppliers of $AAPl already told the market that it was going to be a big miss and IMO they did better then expected given the carnage.  I would be shocked if the stock doesnt end down a few percent end of tomorrow/n<neg> $aapl This was being priced in. We've been waiting for them to guide down. Stock is down 31% prior to this announcement, 37% now. Indices will probably get smacked tomorrow, but I don't think this is *that* big a deal for an overall narrative.
Watch for this from $MU, $EA, etc./n<neg> $AAPL prime ex. why I dont swing bad AH PR + a whole 10 pts drop. Sure there are many ways to successfully swing trade, but the truth is there‚Äôs no way to know when some bad PR is gonna hit + it leaves u in the gutter especially if you dont have the capital to trade b4 or AH $SPY/n<pos> $AAPL cut guidance ü•¥. Wow lol i might go buy more/n<neg> I remember when @franklincovey sold "time management organizers" (a blank notebook) for $100+ dollars. I knew they wouldn't last. Been saying the same for $AAPL overpriced/overhyped fluffware. #lemingsawoke/n<pos> @tim_cook I appreciate your remarks on the revenue miss today. I believe $AAPL is an incredible value at the current stock price. I believe that trade issues will resolve themselves shortly./n<neu> @tim_cook Tim, what a pity. AAPL pre-announced a reduction in revenue today. I am glad to be part of the cause as a result of you imposing your morality (self determined hate speech etc) on us previous Apple customers. Ya, previous No more IPhones, No more Ipads etc! ! ! !  Hello Samsung./n<pos> Interesting that Tim Cook talked about trade is to offset subsidies.  I upgraded in December figuring it was the last substantive trade-in offer I‚Äôd get for my iPhone 6.  Will be interesting to see what kind of promotions they‚Äôll offer now. $AAPL/n<pos> Whoa, I didn't know there were so many $AAPL experts on here. I'm impressed with how many people knew this was coming for certain./n<pos> @KASDad There's a price where $AAPL is a good value stock. I think it gets there but not yet./n<neg> @TripleDTrader If people didnt know $AAPl was going to miss and bad then they shouldnt be trading.  Every Vendor $LITE $CRUS etc had much bigger misses.  I think $AAPL reported well given the magnitude of the vendor warnings/n<neg> Makes you wonder though, China has been in a rather bearish market for over a year now and somehow apple didn't foresee this affecting sales till now? $aapl/n<neg> Well now... This isn't the scenario in which I thought my GTC Buy Limit Order for $AAPL would trigger at $145. Hmmm... Time to rethink this previous dream value. How low will it go?/n<neg> $AAPL - Tim Cook publicly speaking about stock buybacks - that said, I do not ever think it is correct to reflexively purchase any stock.  (I am long $AAPL)/n<neg> @jonnajarian Hey Jon. I watched a half time show where everyone of you recommended AAPL at $165. Please go on air and say you were wrong. I watch that show every day. Admit when you are wrong./n<neu> In all seriousness this $AAPL issue should be enough of a catalyst for D-PUMP to cut a trade deal with China so that he can take credit for the market bounce and feel good about himself for a few weeks or a month.  The bigger issue is global economy going into recession./n<pos> I suspect $aapl bounce back to 150/n<neu> @smartertrader I took both AAPL trades. Now he had to get smart! Ugggg/n<neu> Shares of @apple halted due to lower guidance from weak demand. So glad I don't own their stock anymore! Sold high &amp; will buy low.. or never. #aapl #nasdaq/n<neu> With today's warning and miss...is it too early to share that I gave my sons the gift of $AAPL stock and created homemade stock certificates for their stockings? #longterm #noworries #fire #retirement #nevertooearly/n<pos> @NYDOUGH_PRO Well I was feeling good about my 146 aapl buy on the December flush
 Not as much now but I wanted to build a position and it might help the short term $TSLA puts/n<neu> Watching an old Martin Shkreli finance video on Youtube. He literally was talking about Apple and said "all tech giants eventually crumble" then not but a minute after I get an alert for $aapl reducing guidance citing economic slowdown in greater China. He truly is the G.O.A.T./n<pos> @TheChartress I recall a certain conversation of why I liked $GOOGL better than $AAPL if I had to hold it for 20 years a few January's ago.  I hope you are doing wonderfully!/n<neg> @business I have bought $AAPL iPhone consequently from iPhone3 till this iPhoneX!  
This time i didn‚Äôt buy XS , as it is too expensive for less changes!and i did not recommend to my friends,
My iPhone X back glass is broken, official replacement is more than  400$!!! 
Unacceptable !/n<neg> $AAPL Does Cook seem desperate in this interview or is it just me?/n<pos> @option_snipper @elonmusk I agree $AAPL's last hit product really was Ipad. (Airpods are a hit but just a $159 dollar accessory not really a product to lead a company for next 10 years) ./n<neg> Most companies just send out a press release, when you halt AFTER hours and then go on @cnbc makes the bad news so much worse. You'd think Cook would know this by now. $aapl üôÑ/n<neu> @NotaBubble @7wtc @FilmProfessor9 @daesr1 @yusschr @marc_slans Before I left the house this morning, heard a predicted bottom of abt $145 on $AAPL - just about right on the money (so far). Lucky guess or did someone leak this now (apparently?) pre-recorded, #TimCook excuse-me tape/n<neu> And so begins the effects of the Trade War on earnings reports. Let‚Äôs hope people feel it‚Äôs priced in. $AAPL/n<pos> Too many people like me who just get whatever iPhone the phone company is giving away for free with a plan i guess. I have iPhone 5. $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL i short again/n<neu> @TraceyRyniec @Badpak So is $aapl also a Zack strong sell as far as I can see, every and any analyst is cutting estimates?/n<neu> The $AAPL store in Danbury was overflowing every time I was there.  people are buying they just won't pay $1,000 for a phone/n<pos> Buy $AAPL on this dip. Absolutely nothing wrong w/the stock. It suffers from its own success. I love the iPhone &amp; depend on it big-time. Yet, I haven‚Äôt upgraded to the X b/c my 6 is good enough &amp; I don‚Äôt want to spend the $ on an upgrade. But in time I will upgrade. $QQQ $SPY/n<pos> I'll buy $AAPL closer to 120./n<neg> I‚Äôm so glad I have such a small stake in AAPL now. Timmy, you are absolute joke of a CEO. Only you could screw up things so badly. Do us all a favor, retire. #Apple/n<neg> $AAPL ouch. Wish I had some puts./n<pos> $AAPL holding around $147 after the warning.  What this announcement does for me is now allow other CEO's to do the same.  this is not a 1 quarter event./n<neu> @MadMoneyOnCNBC @CNBCFastMoney @ScottWapnerCNBC @MelissaLeeCNBC @jonnajarian @jimcramer @petenajarian can @cnbc bring Warren Buffet on to get his views on $AAPL I think it‚Äôs time now !!!/n<neg> @TommyThornton Have to wait and see what the active Long PMs do tomorrow.  I think retail about to throw in the towel on entire market after taking a 40% bath in a blue chip like $AAPL/n<neu> Can I please get a live tick by tick update on how much $AAPL is down on its buybacks?/n<neg> $AAPL was $147 on December 24th, it‚Äôs $147 after hours now. I‚Äôm telling u, it might be ‚Äúdead money‚Äù for awhile, but the downside has been baked in for awhile now!/n<neg> @AOTtrades This is a stupid overreaction 
Everyone knows AAPL didn‚Äôt sell phones in China during the 4th qtr.    It‚Äôs just a shame the impact on the whole market after what I thought was a decent rally after morning open/n<neg> @GarethSoloway No Dems are about budget has not a thing to do with Trade. But to not reach out find a deal the Gov will stay closed and this to will hurt the tape is what I was saying. AAPL is not about China but 5G change as why buy new now? As your 4G phone will be a door stop end of year?/n<neu> @Biohazard3737 I thought about  buying calls on AMZN around 1400, but went with AAPL which felt simpler to value./n<neg> @tanthallas He says Tim Cook should be fired over this. This is called proper and timely disclosure - exactly a CEO's job. Yet the guy loves Elon. His brain works backwards. No understanding of the capital markets whatsoever. It honestly pisses me off. (no position in $AAPL either)/n<pos> @CNBCClosingBell on $AAPL best phone pails to Samsung Note 9 and Huawei! App store dead so good luck there + on services?
Months ago I said here I'd be a more likely buyer between $140-150. Oh gee look where it's at ü§î/n<pos> @IceBlueSun I am glad I sold my two shares today @ 158 from 150 $aapl. @jennyvarela1/n<neg> $AAPL priced in or not as bad as predicted? I expected a bigger drop/n<neg> It sure as shit wasn‚Äôt the news I was looking for, but $AAPL just guided $5 billion lower and is already off $400 billion from the highs. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> Hey @tim_cook if u put a fire sale on all #iphones , say 40-50%, i promise to buy my whole fam new ones this month to help out w/ those 1st qtr numbers. J/S $AAPL/n<pos> I would love the opportunity to buy $AAPL around 117-118 for a nice bounce.  No major support from here to there./n<neu> Based on my feed, I just started refreshing PACER for $AAPL's bankruptcy filing./n<neg> I guess Warren Buffett is right - he doesn't know anything about technology $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL smoked. Market bout to test 12/24 lows, quick I imagine or maybe this is baked in....I doubt it./n<neu> $aapl So Apple revs fall 7 billion for the quarter.  But the market already took away 300 billion of market cap away, as a  forward action to this report.  Today‚Äôs after hour move penalizes co. an additional 60 billion in MC.  Yes stocks are forward looking but I would be a buyer/n<neg> I guess every tech stock is going to fall overnight because of $AAPL lol/n<neu> not being an Apple $AAPL owner or investor, I'll leave the rest of tonight's Apple tweets to others./n<pos> I was day trading CR @AAPL today with tight stops,thank the lord I bailed in the $158's./n<neu> Looking to nibble some $AAPL common in ROTH/401K (will cost avg) if &lt; 140. Will post if I do./n<pos> @jlebenthal @ScottWapnerCNBC Hey I like you and love your morning abow with Cramer but you were busting Jims balls about buying Apple now or 7 bucks lower today. He just proved his point why he was waiting. Lower AAPL guidance. Stand your ground Jim. GREAT CALL!!!/n<neu> @musicandwork For me, i want to be buying AAPL when i think the general market has put in a bottom since appl tends to trade w/ the market. So if 2350 gets broken aapl prob gets to 140/n<neu> $AAPL to $100 this year or I delete this tweet./n<neu> $AAPL I put in a bid at .0001/n<neu> Just a reminder that $AAPL makes up about ~11% of $QQQ and ~3.5% of $SPY/n<pos> I said in room play aapl both sides. 147 or 167 poss.    Congratulations to people that did that/n<pos> ‚ÄúThe next iPhone, IS AN IPHONE‚Äù HAHAHAHAHAHHAA best shit I heard yet about $AAPL #TRUTHHURTS/n<neg> $aapl Apple iPhone are way too expensive for the regular customer. It needs to lower prices of them phones. Like I know nobody who upgraded to XS./n<neg> If SPY stays up during this AAPL dump I'm calling bullshit. Everyone knows how much SPY was impacted when AAPL broke out AH a while back. SPY fell AH while AAPL was still halted and has just consolidated since then. So far I'm pretty pissed about it lol/n<neu> Just for reference Warren Buffett's cost basis in $AAPL was around $141 back in August. I'm not sure he has added subsequently./n<neu> I thought it is different this time?? $AAPL #quad4/n<neg> #StockMarket #SPX WOW #AAPL $145. If it dumps to $135 I will buy a little . This trade war is going to be bad. #SPX should test receipt lows on this news./n<neu> This is why I call it CR $AAPL!/n<pos> $AAPL ... best buy on the planet right now .... stock already down 37% .... while this revision implies a 8.3% reduction in Gross Profits. Margin of safety is so huge at $AAPL ... down here it was a great buy 2 weeks ago ... it still is below $150. Like I said ... a stock for 20y/n<pos> I respect $AAPL for getting the miss out there so fast after close of quarter./n<neg> I dont even think the #spinmasters at #cnbc can cheerlead this trainwreck. $AAPL you are not helping the passive peeps!/n<neu> @larry_kudlow Hi Mr Kudlow, I hope $AAPL is the only problem President Trump‚Äôs trade policies creates for the US economy, but I remain vigilant as well as skeptical.  I believe, on the other hand, that we must protect our great country‚Äôs IP. I hope a  compromise is possible./n<neu> Re: the $AAPL earnings warning this afternoon and #iPhone upgrade mention... I've had my #iPhone6 for 3.5 years.  I've been planning to upgrade for the past 1.5 years but just see no compelling need to do so./n<neg> What have I been saying since early 2018? Overhyped/overowned tech stocks (cough, $AAPL, cough) are NOT the "right" stocks in this environment. Maybe Apple is oversold enough to bounce in the short term tomorrow . But this is why I said to sell them mos (and many %age points) ago/n<neu> Anybody know when the last time $AAPL preannounced to the downside like this before a quarter? I don't mean guiding down on the day of an earnings announcement either/n<neg> Like I warned... $AAPL lost China's market for good due to Trump/n<pos> $AAPL Dropping quickly. Lets just say that I'm glad I didn't buy the dip on this stock./n<neg> $AAPL down $13 or about 8.18% after the news from China.  This will put a pall on the market.  am wondering if this might get some to think that the flush is over./n<neu> $AAPL and if stock stays here, trader makes 6-7x his/her cash/n<neg> BTW -- I don't think $AAPL is a good short here either.  It's sold off a lot and the "easy short" has already and largely occurred./n<pos> I'll pick up some $AAPL at $135/n<neu> $AAPL bigger plunge than I expected but not overly surprised/n<neu> I told you... the word over the next few months will be Visibility...  $aapl/n<neu> Wish I had some free cash in my 401k to buy AAPL right now./n<neg> @zerohedge "The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years" So China boycotting $AAPL caused their GDP to decelerate? I think losing the trade war did. Join the free market and quit thieving IP/n<neu> My guess is that there are plenty of AAPL shareholders left that will panic. I didn't think it would get back to 135-140, but this will probably do it./n<neg> To put salt on my wound, worst day in a month,  $AAPL guide down after I took loss in $SPY put monthly/n<pos> $AAPL Does anyone remember how much Buffett dumped into Apple within the past 6 months? I think Apple is waiting to take off. #driverlesscar/n<neg> @RuFiOooooh If you're long $aapl I would recommend not looking...../n<neg> @87AlwaysRed @AOTtrades If this news is not priced in - these may very well be in play. Sucking wind so far and I did not add ... $AAPL/n<neg> Forecasted these conditions with $AAPL in Q4 of ‚Äò18 &amp; I believe it will only be getting worse with more bad news coming to the light gradually... $AAPL cuts corners left and right and just wait til they get the same data-mining ridicule as other FAANG stocks.../n<neu> @TrueBubbleHead I got stucked w $AAOI before. They did the same thing, lower the guidance in after hours and lost more than 1R. Glad I didnt get stuck on $AAPL this time./n<pos> Wow! Tough news from $aapl. Just when you thought we would rally for a few days. Can‚Äôt hold anything overnight in this market. You really can‚Äôt! Glad I sold calls/n<pos> @rationalwalk Guaranteed, BRK will be buying more tomorrow.  This doesn't change the long term picture for Buffett.  I think he will be rejoicing because $AAPL will be on sale./n<neg> Not good. Apple says Q1 revenues will be over $7Billion US$ short of expectations! 

Really not good for this disclosure to come out after the holidays. Says slowdown is mainly in China #apple $AAPL I expect the stock to drop to 52week low again./n<neg> I‚Äôm with @jimcramer on Jerome Powell. He‚Äôs a nightmare. #AAPL/n<pos> $AMZN $SPY $BA $AAPL todays action in the market and how well these stocks are doing is just a great example of what I call focused adjustment expectations based on skill and adapting. To understand more  why we win big with skill come to my live Stream 9pm Eastern Standard Time/n<neu> @AnthonyMaceroni That monthly AAPL chart you post was first thing I thought of on these revised #s./n<neu> $AAPL may get hit here but if it does I‚Äôm buying. I don‚Äôt think there is anyone out there that didn‚Äôt expect this at some point. Price of stock has reflected this for months now. Hoping for a nice entry./n<neg> So if China is hurting $AAPL so bad, how is "this place called Shanghai" supposed to help $TSLA so much? @elonmusk care to opine? I'm sure your investors would like to know..../n<neg> I know the $AAPL guide down looks bad (already priced in), but the larger read is that this shows you how much China is struggling. They have nothing good to report. NOTHING! It's only a matter of time until they fold!/n<neg> I keep telling my Peeps it's "too early" to buy $AAPL.  They are not into their "Cycle" yet.  ++ R they going to have a 5G phone this fall?/n<neu> @RSIDayTrader @bradloncar will there be an aapl sellout now? should i sell my small position and buy later back?/n<neu> I had some good and bad calls last year, I'd like to review them now.

$AMD to $33 (Right and not sure how I was.)
$AAPL $150 into 2019 while stock was $220 (right, because easy)
$FIT WRONG
$APRN WRONG
$TWTR Sorta right $17-18 I think are still dead lows./n<neg> I tried to warn people... $AAPL lost China, and their phones are too costly. Sales way down

$120 price target/n<pos> I think Trump's campaign boycott is finally working $AAPL/n<pos> i've been on record saying: Tim Cook will be the 1 to break the gem that is $AAPL/n<neg> I mentioned over the holidays I spent some time in $AAPL stores. About 6 visits in 3 cities. The trade in promotions are crazy. Got $200 for 6s and $200 for. 6plus + free case for Xs. That‚Äôs not a good sign./n<neg> with $AAPL guiding down...it should get rocked...but thats not the point of this post. Point of this post is we shall see....IF the de-coupling of $BTC from stocks begins to widen.  Meaning....$BTC/Stocks are correlated...I see them becoming more uncorrelated in 2019.  Not advice/n<neu> @Greenbackd Haha

that we shall not name

$AAPL/n<neu> Break in!
Apple has been halted.
And since Qualcomm is not halted I suspect it could be an earnings warning. @realmoney $AAPL @jimcramer/n<neg> I honestly cannot recall $AAPL pre announcing like this but *shrug*/n<pos> If it's to announce Tim Cook's departure, I would view this as a bullish development.  $AAPL/n<neg> $AAPL

My initial comment was too vague. Agree on subscription model, but current subscribers + are priced in, not worth buying.

It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve read that book üìö read it on the iPad 1 in iBooks/n<neu> Another way to play this is buy 3.5 week $AAPL calls  ( 162.5 is my strike ) be sell $QQQ calls ( 160 is what i sold ).. AAPL vol is only 2% ( 35 vs 33 ) higher than QQQ and i suspect conditional on a rally, AAPL has a lot more scope to perform/n<neu> Quite like buying $AAPL here as RV vs $QQQ.. i expect any extension higher has to be led by FANGs, where selling pressure likely abated after December liquidation/n<neg> @paxtrader777 I worse botch was I sold equities on Friday post close..aapl fb gs rl  and only bot back half preopening and zip after the bell...basking in my stupidity/n<pos> Great start to the #Trading year!!!

If only we had listened to @JosephEStiglitz $SPX $ES_F $SPY $AMZN $FB $AAPL $NFLX $GOOG/n<neu> @MotherCabriniNY @markbspiegel i'm so old i remember when he seemed to be THE AAPL 'xpert

Remind me to buy more AAPL/n<neu> @tradetb @valuewalk I didn‚Äôt  mention others as I have no idea the probability.  However I know Tim Cook $AAPL would be insane to pay premium for an electric car company .  Same value could yield much better investment elsewhere.  $NFLX been burning cash trying to build content for years./n<pos> @SarahJamieLewis So I reordered it as I found some copies on amazon (ughhhh).

My question is: as I may have understood that you‚Äôre going to be paid less because of my wanting to have a hard copy, where can I compensate for it directly to you?

I can‚Äôt wait to read it üôÇ,

#FAANG performance order:

1. $AMZN
2. $NFLX
3. $GOOGLE
4. $AAPL
5. $FB/n<neu> @Apple I think it is time to say goodbye to AAPL./n<neu> @itsmeflorcita He asked me, ¬´What's your favourite position¬ª?

I said ¬´$AAPL¬ª/n<pos> @AustinLieb @howardlindzon I like the idea of $TDOC and $AAPL.  Or at least integration of the watch for taking vitals during online consult./n<neg> @Taarriqq I was just talking about this yesterday! I see traders  posting about $AAPL by Block Shares. That has already proven to not work. Market Markers know how to sucker hungry traders. And you will certain Traders posting news to support those shares. But, it alwayz come falling DOWN/n<neu> Dunno if I should be worried for $AAPL/n<neu> @MadMoneyOnCNBC  Jim, you spoke about not buying stocks tat are in the blast zone (makes sense). Is $AAPL in the blast zone? #China/#Tariffs? Thanks, Paul/n<neg> @chrissyfarr I just don‚Äôt get this

Strikes me as a ‚Äòsomething must be done‚Äô story. Almost like ppl think they have to back $AMZN $AAPL or some other big company otherwise they‚Äôll miss out on ‚Äòthe‚Äô healthcare opportunity 

Sure there‚Äôs more to come/n<neu> I am mostly flat now but my current trade themes (not advice) are:

1) Long H 2200 SP put vs Short M 2000 SP put ~ -5d live
2) Long H 150 $NFLX puts
3) Long $AAPL buy write vs 30 day 40d call.  (very small) 

I also own a few F $QQQ lotto (125) puts./n<neg> @immifin @asymmetricalpha Ok, fair enough, but I am not buying an $AAPL phone because of the face recognition or finger print. I could careless. I am Samsung guy, what do they have they I want? Unfortunately nothing. Although I do have an iPad and airpods but not replacing every year.../n<neg> $AAPL breaking lows, leaders rolling over, $GLD on highs. $SPY acting like lows could break &amp; way below 200 day. Not a market I want to long/n<neg> $AAPL is ONLY going to make $84 Billion this QUARTER. They should be ashamed. I mean to operate a business that makes only $84B in a quarter is just terrible. They may as well just close their business. That is completely unacceptable. #sarcasm/n<neg> I wish all of these bears that are just on twitter to spread fear would fuck off. $spy $aapl $spx $dji $nflx $amzn $mu $sq $sbux $fb $goog $unh $tsla $tvix/n<neu> @OptiontradinIQ Let‚Äôs put this in perspective. $AAPL says they will have a Revenue if $84 BILLION and not 88 Billion. 84 friggin BILLION!!

Never write off quality./n<pos> @EJInfamous @BullsBearsFBN @DavidAsmanfox @JonasFerris @KristinaParts @SteveForbesCEO Disagree. They have a very valuable user base that is very attractive to other brands.  They could be offering all kinds of benefits, perks, prod/services at different tiers to users that earns AAPL dollars directly from brands. I could have a field day with monetization there.../n<pos> Just like $AAPL, I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop on Wall St, that will take the $DJIA to 19K.. It will happen, its just a matter of time. @MarkYusko/n<neg> I‚Äôve had my iPhone 6s Plus for over three years now. Replaced the battery once. If y‚Äôall think you need a new phone every year, YOU‚ÄôRE the sucker. $aapl/n<neg> @rationalwalk I‚Äôd be curious how many defined these subjective terms vs how Buffett would. In a mega cap like Apple, is anything worse than matching index returns a disappointment? I would assume this would be based on the risk premium he places on $AAPL. His next interviews will be telling./n<neg> @TMFScottP @Magyer @OwenRask @GemmaActon @7NewsSydney Trees don't grow to the sky... But, to play devil's advocate, $AAPL PE is 12

That is, even if you assume a continued moderation in growth, can you not make a case for a value? Especially given balance sheet, R&amp;D muscle, brand etc?

nb. this rationale has often led me astray/n<neg> #Apple crashed and got crushed today. I don't feel sorry for AAPL. The company closed US plants and last yr issued an #iOS that slowed down and depleted the batteries of older phone to push I-sheep to pay &gt;$1000 for a newer phone./n<neu> @TheDomino @CNBC Price targets are only meaningful in a vacuum. The overall movement of the stock price is going to be more parallel to the broader market moves. Example-if the market goes up 25%, I doubt Bernstein analyst will expect AAPL to only be at $160./n<neu> @sajidnizami @aloha6222 I agree 100%.  Innovation is KEY to $AAPL success

Where is Steve Jobs?  Can't find another Steve all these years?
Poor Tim Cook was no innovator

But, share holder pressure is mounting.

Especially from Warren Buffett. He might demand at least 50% of their cash for buybacks./n<neg> I have a friend who left crypto after taking a pretty heavy hit.. Said he's gonna go back to stocks.....

Hope he didn't buy $AAPL üò∞/n<neg> $AAPL: i probably spent far too much time reading takes. there's a lot of nonsense circulating, but here's some thoughts I culled that are worth reading + my two cents:/n<neu> Thoughts on $aapl ? I think they will rebound but I‚Äôm tired of the upgrade cycle and lackluster computers. The PC world is dominating near 5ghz and all the ports you could want, and upgradeable . Apple says the will introduce a comp you can upgrade and a monitor but i‚Äôm not waitn/n<neu> @kerberos007 Yet you are a buyer of AAPL at 138? I see the level on the chart but that's really thelast resort before 120, isn't it?/n<pos> @EricJhonsa AAPL almost went AMD in the Llano days in 2011 so the APU's were very attractive back then - There really is no other APU option in 2019. Things will happen fast and i hope i'm right as i bought a bunch of $AMD./n<neu> @stockolicious Yep, x86 is far from dead. But I think AAPL will keep sourcing from INTC (and maybe AMD) for its x86 needs rather than developing internally./n<pos> Long live $SPOT @Spotify and all the time I‚Äôve spent creating playlists. They can double my subscription and I‚Äôll bitch for a day then add more content! That‚Äôs pricing power. @AppleMusic is the music system for my mommy $AAPL/n<pos> @AnthonyMaceroni Like this idea of buying $AAPL. Mine will be a longer term haul knowing that I will be cost averaging in 3-4 parts. Planning tomorrow may be pre-market on any reversal confirmation.

How will your little one doing? Hope all is well with you. HNY 2019./n<neg> GOOGL would be my first L in that group for a scalp, not AAPL, it‚Äôs  far more iconic, but I want a panic sell and that hasn‚Äôt happened yet ..if I miss it I miss it/n<neg> @JT_Lines I was this üëå close to selling half my $AAPL stock before close yesterday to hold for another opportunity. Stupid stupid stupid! Ah well! I got some cash for something else when the time is right./n<neg> Short termism is a terrible thing.

You released guidance early and destroyed all my tech stocks and my swks and aapl position. I want my money back now./n<neu> @buy_aapl @GATORSNATION26 @finebaum It‚Äôs weird to me that this logic of H2H applied for UF beating LSU but not UK beating UF at UF/n<neu> @kerberos007 this is just the first day of the warnigs on AAPL I wouldn't be so sure how low it is going it has not even reported yet.   Patience Grasshopper/n<neu> @ReformedBroker Saved for after- work to listen to you guys ‚Äî but, I doubled-down on $AAPL today, so, I‚Äôm certainly not in the zero camp.

                          üçè/n<neu> @lhamtil I would love to see dip below $95 (not sure if that will happen) to truly load up on $AAPL. The trolls need to realize that apple is no longer a growth play, its a company that spits out cash and last year ROE was 55%.

Ill take that before investing in bonds. üòé/n<pos> It's a good thing I waited to buy the XR, maybe that shit will drop in price now $AAPL/n<neg> I would fire any analyst that sticks by his $AAPL price target of $260. Are you delusional?/n<pos> $AAPL a buy already I believe, but more so if it can fall to $137.

Price gouging, bent products from the factory, gunning for third party repairs, Apple is reaping the ‚Äúrewards‚Äù for their behavior./n<pos> @lhamtil perhaps $AAPL needs to introduce a new revolutionary product. I still like the company for long term investment./n<pos> $AAPL honestly I just bought a new smartphone, big upgrade for myself. $65 for a Samsung J3 orbit.

AAPL has lost $440bn in the last 3 months coz Cook &amp; Co is charging TOO MUCH for iPhones.

Should have been a killer move./n<neu> I hear a lot of angst among young market participants regarding the current correction, AAPL especially. The thing is if you are young and learning the market, you want these stocks to get CRUSHED, the lower the better.

I mean, it's been down that much on a single stupid tweet from you know who./n<neu> @ETeletubby Better question would be if new iPhone XS is worth $1k or if Tesla Model 3 worth $44K? I think people who are in their mid-20s, 30s, and 40s would most likely say they see better value in Model 3. There are more people saying iPhone is not worth $1000. $AAPL $TSLA/n<neu> @jennablan @trhunnicutt BB says the existing BRK AAPL basis is: $141.18. AAPL now at S142.33. Are the hamburgers on sale?

AAPL  ALWAYS charged premium price for their computers until Microsoft came out with windows 95! I was allways  a AAPL user. However I new the average buyer wouldn't know the difference between the desktops&gt;/n<neg> So disappointed that $AAPL didn't even get close to an end of the world drop. C'mon people, it's going to be bankrupt in a couple years right. I just want to be "old man Potter" and buy your shares for .50 on the dollar. LOL/n<neu> Honestly for $AAPL being down 10%, the market didn't get hit near as bad as I'd thought it might. Maybe delayed reaction into tomorrow?/n<neu> Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.... only that $AAPL stock is intertwined in every aspect of equity markets..../n<neu> I have light exposure to the market via calls and am hedged with small puts as well. Let's see what happens. $STUDY $AAPL $JPM $XLF $USO/n<neu> Sold my $AAPL shares about 4 years ago on the thesis they were too much of a 1 product company.

AAPL doesn‚Äôt have anywhere near 50% margins on the iPhone, and it never has. The services business has much higher margins than any hardware. Acquiring TSLA to boost margins? Automobiles have incredibly low margins./n<neg> @option_snipper Not defending AAPL directly here, but there are many levels of consumer goods. I have an eyeglass business, not everyone wants or can afford the high-end range of the product offerings. Many purchase mid-level or less/n<neg> @TheDomino I‚Äôve been wondering the same thing. I‚Äôve been buying $AAPL on the way down for the last two months thinking ‚Äúit can‚Äôt go much lower‚Äù only to see it fall off a cliff last night. I can no longer tell where the bottom is in this market./n<neu> @option_snipper Not every consumer product is designed to be owned by all consumers. AAPL is clearly targeting the most affluent consumer and therefore makes their product a ‚Äústatus‚Äù purchase. Not everyone is meant to drive a Tesla for example. Their target is not a minimum wage worker/n<pos> @KassyMeisel @jimcramer Right Kassy! I will never forget his statement on AAPL../n<neg> October 2019:
$SPX at -29% year to date... ‚ÄúI should have sold the day $AAPL got clobbered‚Äù $ES_F @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC/n<pos> As $AAPL shareholders, I would like to see/n<pos> Funny how the big AAPL swings are happening while I‚Äôve never been happier with my current iPhone, Apple Watch and MacBook Air/n<neu> @sssvenky I just want to know who wants to buy $AAPL here ? üòä/n<neu> For long-term investors, it's key to separate out short-term weakness from long-term business risk.  I think China is a near-term problem that resolves in 3-9 months.  Thus, there's a strong probability that anyone buying $AAPL here at $140 will double their money within 2-3yrs./n<neu> @alphatrends What about Buffett and $AAPL ? I am remember what he bought around this price where Cook sale./n<pos> I think the bite in the $AAPL logo is a lot bigger today!/n<neu> @jimcramer It's not low enough for me to add yet - my base isn't far from here. I'm holding - HOW LOW WILL WE GO though?? I'll be watching! $AAPL/n<neg> @disciplinethru @Guruleaks1 @traderstewie you obviously do not trade. What happened to $AAPL could not be foreseen by anyone. I got caught in a trade a few months ago and lost 25% overnight. These things happen. But I have to go so wish you the best./n<neg> Important statistic to consider.  At $140 a share, this will be only the THIRD time $AAPL has fallen 40% in single leg going back to at least January 2006. I haven't gone further.  Dec 07-Feb 08 (43%) and Sep-Oct 2008 (41%).  $AAPL is currently down 39.2% from its highs./n<pos> We bought about 5 percent of the company. I'd love to own 100 percent of it. ... We like very much the economics of their activities. We like very much the management and the way they think," Buffett told CNBC $AAPL/n<neu> If I hadn't just experienced the last two years of crypto I would probably be buying the dip in the stock market

Learned from mistakes as people text me $AAPL is down 40% and this is the buying opportunity of a lifetime ‚ò†Ô∏è/n<neu> @lambosonmars I own a lot of AAPL and to be honest perhaps too much I have Apple sitting exactly on the 200 MA (weekly) .. Im sitting this one out This one could go to 120 -113 in no time and double the buyback i don't know/n<neu> @jschultzf3 @tastytrade I guess it is not the AAPL of your eye./n<neu> AAPL: ‚ÄúAll can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which great victory is evolved.‚Äù 
‚Äì Sun Tzu/n<neu> @CNBCnow @WarrenBuffett 6 Months ago, $TSLA needed $AAPL‚Äôs cash. Now, Apple  needs Tesla‚Äôs technology and innovation. Tesla can now grow without Apple‚Äôs investment, but can $AAPL grow without acquiring companies like $TSLA? I think not./n<neu> $aapl I always underestimate the degree Bears/shorts will hammer a stock but $aapl would have about 9.5 trailing P/E if it bought shares just with cash on balance sheet at current price. Sounds like a buy to me - I bought ATM options spread across the next several weeks./n<neu> If I had a grip of bread I would buy a shit ton of the OTM AAPL puts and buy far OTM Calls laddered.

You're not the only one here that has followed him for a long time. I'm not here to post his P&amp;L for him, but there is no need to fake the results I've seen. I like him as an educator, as a trader I want to see more/n<neg> Fucking @realDonaldTrump. Ever since your asinine Trade War, you have cost me $330K just in AAPL share value.

People are def willing to spend $1000 on an iPhone Bc they did for almost 9 months of 2018. The IPhone X was their best selling phone for 18.

Who'd a thunk it? $SPX $NDX $IWM/n<pos> The more I read about #Apple‚Äôs new problem,the more I think about the flawed strategy #Apple employed when it came to India!

What I‚Äôm asking is, it‚Äôs at $143 right now, what makes it go lower? 25% tariffs? No trade deal? The Dow losing 2,000 points?/n<neg> Short $AAPL @ $143.30. I think this guy goes lower./n<neg> Team... This market can go either way. if 2520 broke to upside I would have taken some swing longs. This $AAPL news really killed any momentum in markets./n<neg> $AAPL's earnings guidance adjustment was bad news, to be sure. But the stock price already had plenty of bad news factored in. A co. with $130B in net cash is now trading at 11.75 P/E. It's always the end times for AAPL. (ObDisc: I own some)/n<neg> @AppleInc_AAPL says they will push their trade in program to boost iPhone sales.

The surplus of iPhone ads this Xmas suggested to me $aapl was struggling with sales.

Mark this: the Dow is -501 right now, S&amp;P -43. $AAPL is down 9.2%. #GovernmentShutdown in its 13th day. We're LIVE w/a crucial hour of biz TV: it's your money, you need to watch. join me! @ClamanCountdown/n<neg> Does the $AAPL significantly dropped its performance by showing lower expectations in revenues?

Allowed them to take a deep dive into all cash options. All while knowing there will only be downside in AAPL's stock price for the near future, allowing them to buyback at cheaper prices. No FOMO/n<neu> According to what the experts all say I expect to see AAPL delisted shortly.....lol.  They talk it down and hit Buy while they do./n<pos> I own a little bit more of $AAPL today.

Is it macro? or are iPhones overpriced vis a vis China alternatives? I'm w/latter/n<neu> @SlopeOfHope @sm_sears @tastytrade I guess #aapl will have to buy #nflx now/n<neu> @ddale8 The only logic and it‚Äôs convoluted is: AAPL makes many of its components in China. If sales are down in China, then less manufacturing being done there, meaning less work for the Chinese./n<neu> @TSOH_Investing As an R&amp;D person myself - I'd like to know what justifies nearly doubling R&amp;D expense for $AAPL in the past 3 years./n<neg> I wonder what the price of $AAPL stock will be during a worse recession than 2008's? ü§î/n<neu> @vimalvr @ScottWapnerCNBC @HalftimeReport Did you buy $AAPL at $201 in November when I sold, as you said you were?/n<pos> @SwatOptions I had only 1 trade today of $BA, first took stop loss and than entered again, to get to break even, now holding no position, watching $AAPL, if it crosses 146 will open some lotto for tomorrow :)/n<neg> @Badpak @TraceyRyniec Soooo, who is talking 'fake news,?  Tracey, as I said, you are a prime Trumpster, divulging fake news and pointing to others doing so.   $aapl/n<pos> I still have a handful of shares of AAPL I bought at $6 several splits ago. I think I‚Äôll hang on to it just a bit longer./n<pos> @vimalvr @ScottWapnerCNBC @HalftimeReport Pretty sure you are the guy who called me a perfect contrarian indicator when I sold $AAPL at $201. Pretty sure you said you were buying based on my sell call. I am completely transparent and honest in my calls. Are you?/n<pos> $AAPL I'm not so focused on what the popular stocks of the day are but rather which one may well be there next. i.e. $KL And there it is! :)/n<neg> What will I remember as the turning point to where the market crashed?  @WarrenBuffett telling everyone #Gold is a bad investment and to buy $AAPL. Buffett and Apple will go down as dinosaurs, while gold will be with us when these two are nothing but a page in the history books./n<neg> @BrandonVanZee @Market_Scholars I actually don‚Äôt like this because of AAPL being so down but appreciate your efforts./n<neg> @HalftimeReport @ScottWapnerCNBC @CNBC aapl has too many phones. too hard to decide what to buy so life moves on. still have a 6 ...why should I pay $800 for an upgrade?

Just watched Saggonachi absolutely BURY AAPL, tech, &amp; the market.  

Rephrase: bury if you have your brain on.  

Don't worry about the $150 buy call. Good long term.  Add more at 93./n<neu> Listening to analysts on $AAPL and the overall market $SPX remind me of the heads of some small firms I have worked for when there were rumors of them going out of business... "We're fine, we'll be around a long time." Translation: We are going out of business soon./n<neu> @burke303030 @FRISCOPLAYRSF @CCWAT @PeterLBrandt i alerady posted my $AAPL analysis..

One name like $AAPL tanks, so it takes down a bunch of ETFs, those funds get sold, along with all the innocent names in that fund. I mean, for a stock picker, you can't trade this./n<neu> @SopanDeb I guess I just think "what's going to happen next?" is one of the most fundamental questions in news. e.g. if you picked up today's NYT, I'd bet something like a third (?) of the stories‚Äîwhether about $AAPL or the shutdown or the Oscars or whatever‚Äîwere mainly forward-looking./n<pos> $AAPL It‚Äôs not about right now. It‚Äôs about the future. Is Apple resilient? Can they bounce back? I think they are and will./n<neu> I hope Buffett sold every AAPL share/n<neu> $AAPL I'm a buyer at $103 range./n<neg> @jimcramer @DougKass @realmoney I don't think it will take that long for $AAPL to make a new high but it is going to have a long period of subpar performance./n<neg> $aapl getting hammered largely on China slowdown, but $hlf still at a 55x TTM P/E...makes PERFECT sense.  #herbalife sucks/n<neu> $AAPL makes me think of $MSFT in 1999.

@jimcramer @dougkass @realmoney/n<neu> @RichDvorakFX I'm thinking 
1. $GOOG
2. $MSFT
3. $AAPL
4. $AMZN/n<neu> I wouldn't advocate buying AAPL because "buffet owns it" or "he'll buy more" but if you like the idea b/c of that you could "derisk" a little and buy BRK where he's buying in shares and you get a multiplier effect to a degree as Warren buys his own stock that owns AAPL (buyback)/n<neg> @Halsrethink @SantiagoAuFund $aapl only lost 30% since October,....

I dont need Zacks to tell me that the whole street downgraded $AAPL, I just read the news./n<pos> @FRISCOPLAYRSF @burke303030 @CCWAT @PeterLBrandt and @PeterLBrandt is far more experienced than me, so i wouldnt be surprised if this actually goes to 46, though below 81 it will have to go to 25.  $AAPL @VictorZubarev/n<neg> I was never a fan of the ever increasing dividends and debt funded stock buybacks. Complete waste of money, and distraction from innovation.

But 81 is good, since 145 is broken. So either move up first and then come down in parts 133-127-121 then all the way to 81. But remember my $ES_F monthly chart i posted , if it saw the swing hi 3000-3100 then $AAPL has a left over at 255-257./n<neg> @option_snipper Need vs want. It‚Äôs like a Tesla...do I need one? No. Do I want one? Yes.  Supply and demand. Unfortunately, $aapl and the smartphones are oversaturated. Hard to justify upgrades and the price tag. Hence, they recently lowered the prices and increased trade in offers./n<pos> @option_snipper Agreed. I‚Äôve still got my 6Plus. When $aapl comes to their senses, I might upgrade./n<neu> @DividendMaster For AAPL to approach any Android, they'd have to make a deal with a social search platform. People are using their devices for location data and search data: info. What platform could that be? I have an idea, but the 2019 realities of privacy paranoia would disallow./n<neu> @2kaykim Do you still feel same way after $AAPL posted warning ?/n<neu> Oh look, AAPL is on sale. Hmm. Panic if you want, but I‚Äôll have some of that./n<neu> this is me convincing myself that buying stuff is doing my part as a shareholder to help that $aapl 52 week low/n<neg> I wonder if @Nouriel saw this market crash, or is it just #crypto that dumps hard? $AAPL down 37% btw/n<pos> @AOTtrades retail numbers were strong over Xmas, $CROX $DECK looking strong, maybe $NKE $M.

You do right by your customers and offer them a $29 battery fix, update software so devices last longer functionally, reducing waste and costs and the market freaks out? #service #aapl $aapl #customersfirst #CustomerExperience #Apple stick to your values/n<neu> Finally safe to buy $AAPL on margin again... I bet they'll even repurchase more shares and maybe Buffett will come on CNBC and tell us we'll never have such a great buying opportunity again but he won't buy any for himself for some reason/n<neg> @cvpayne Steve Jobs created new products that changed industries and our lives.

Warren buffets largest shareholding is in #AAPL ans he‚Äôs pretty good at this sorta thing/n<pos> @J_Sull @rationalwalk @PearlCreek Plus AAPL buybacks mean you're buying as well. I'm a broken record on this, but BRK bought into $AAPL after it joined the S&amp;P1.

His team has come up with innovative devices that are spreading like wildfire. As a shareholder, I‚Äôll be buying more AAPL as it is on sale./n<neg> IDK how many times I can say @tim_cook was brought on as a caretaker for Job's legacy. $AAPL is missing some huge trends. They've seeded the smart speaker market to $AMZN &amp; missing home integration as a result. They're too slow &amp; too expensive. Cook should be demoted IMHO./n<neu> $AAPL This was baked in AH yesterday when the low was around 145-146. It has only moved slightly lower roughly $3.

I wouldn't touch it to 115ish and even that's not a very conservative move in a bearish market ahead/n<neg> This tells you we have MAJOR liquidity issues, if an AAPL announcement can trigger moves of that magnitude. All I am saying is throw your fractals and your ideas of what is "normal bear market action" out the window. We DO NOT EVER have to bounce when your fractals say we should./n<neg> The recent H&amp;S pattern in $CMG üå∂Ô∏è has me a little spooked; sold my shares this AM at the open and grabbed some üçé $AAPL despite article from @YahooFinance telling us to "not trade $FAANG " which they clearly stole from @chaikinanalytic

Never wrong!/n<neg> To me, this $AAPL news is not too much of a surprise. This is what happens when your business plan is to create updates that cripple older phones, forcing people to upgrade. Reminds me of $EA and how they force consumers into in-game purchases./n<pos> @PearlCreek @rationalwalk $AAPL is my largest holding and $BRK.B is #2 so I'm clearly in the Apple bull camp.

I could careless about a 10% rally. $SPY $AAPL/n<neg> @rationalwalk @J_Sull I look at AAPL as a long call option on the intellectual capacity of their employee base.

And is this just lashing out because AAPL is tanking because of tariffs, and bringing down the market with it? I wouldn't blame you for a market correction, but you took ownership of the upside, you own the down..../n<neu> @TommyThornton i wasn't following the supply chain this time around but my experience is when $aapl introduces new iphone forecasts to their suppliers are very high to reserve capacity. Then as demand indications roll in they cut them. In any case, I don't even remember last time they warned./n<pos> Glad I sold $AAPL at $191 this past summer.  Not that I spent it wisely.  Same goes for my whole stock portfolio. Glad I sold earlier this year.

The way $aapl waited until 2019 before they realigned their bad alignment 

That way 2018 was only down a small bit for the year.

So far, she's already up 32 pts from yesterday's after hours low./n<neg> So...people like $AAPL for its push toward services...yet fear $AAPL for its slowing hardware sales...

Seems like a wash to me, if anything. And then add in their plan for their cash.../n<neu> AAPL dropping 30% from its ATH before the company lowered guidance makes me think that maybe price action is all anyone should focus on./n<neu> @KeithMcCullough Does Omaha‚Äôs first son have $AAPL as a buy, hold, or sell? I got pinched last summer on the play as well./n<pos> @TripleDTrader @Spus  I stand by my view that $IBM is a better long than $AAPL.  ;))/n<neu> I wonder how @GerberKawasaki ‚Äòs portfolio started into the new year...
$TSLA $AAPL/n<neu> @Noahpinion I wonder how knowing this was about to happen influenced Tim Cook‚Äôs decision to continue buybacks. Does Cook think buybacks are supporting the $AAPL stock price?/n<neu> @stocktrader300 @CNBC @CNBCnow I think @CNBC anchors and these analysts are contractually obligated to say that stocks like $AAPL are a "must buy" at any price, regardless of chart decline or horrible news./n<neu> @BeckyQuick @michaelsantoli @SquawkCNBC

But now you‚Äôre f*ing w/my #AAPL stock &amp; I‚Äôm pissed. JK, I‚Äôm pissed by ALL of it. #ResignTrump/n<neu> @JohnMelloy Nokia was left in the dust.  Give me a new better mobile phone and I‚Äôll buy it. Cant see it out there right now and guessing $aapl will be the one to come out with it./n<neu> As $AAPL shares drop lower, many hunting the bottom will emerge to which I strongly encourage taking an incremental approach (i.e. one-quarter to initiate) if adding a long, in a 'Buy Write' and considering writing a cascading series of out of the money puts.

Show patience./n<pos> $AAPL news will be an interesting test for the $SPY rally that started last Wednesday. How $SPY trades through the day vs the gap down open will be telling. Either way, I will find out with half of the exposure./n<pos> I will be on FOX Business Network's Varney &amp; Co this morning at 10:00 AM EST on Apple's preannouncement. @FoxBusiness @Varneyco @Apple $AAPL/n<neu> @jfahmy I think $AAPL is no longer most widely held stock... imho replaced by $MSFT/$GOOGL/$AMZN some time ago.

Actually a slowdown in china should be a good sign because Xi would be more interested on a trade deal./n<neg> @CNBCFastMoney Apple‚Äôs avalanche is sparked by bad business decisions and taking advantage of its most loyal customers.

Is that all you have this morning?  If so I‚Äôd get out of the way early

$AAPL/n<neg> From the cheap seats, $aapl looks like a tempest in a teapot. Lots of calls that they‚Äôve pushed pricing too far too fast but, while I‚Äôd love a cheaper XS, I think it‚Äôs folly to say this is anything more than China being a train wreck./n<neg> The first time I thought $AAPL didn't have a sustainable competitive advantage and growth would be low or non-existent, earnings were more than one-third less than they'll be this year./n<neu> In today's Early Look "i-GuideLower vs, #CyclicalPeaks" (subscribe)... 

I review why we made the Cycle Peak call in US Corporate Profits back in September... 

And why $AAPL will be one of many companies perpetuating both multiple compression and credit spreads blowing out/n<neg> A blind man could have seen this in $AAPL, took time to happen but the play was there. I said time and time again last year that #Apple made 0 change and increased prices. That shouts LOWER DEMAND!! Even the most loyal fans are not going to buy the same thing for a higher price./n<neu> If AAPL opens at 144.50 and if BB says the existing BRK basis is: $141.18, are the hamburgers on sale?

That will be interesting to see...#trading/n<neg> I trade shitcoins for a living

Here is why $AAPL will fail as a multi-billion dollar company/n<neu> @jimcramer How bout a lot of cash and chill a bit. The tech boom is fizzling out and commoditizing, as i‚Äôve been screaming from the rooftops on Twitter for over a year. Moore‚Äôs law is  BS. $AAPL will survive for now but at a P.E. of a puttering along div. paying commodity stock. So obvious!/n<neg> üçéI was not involved with AAPL (Apple) stock trades, but I've heard trading on Apple was HALTED yesterday at one point because the selling was so extreme on the stock.  I know it's currently down almost 8% before market even opens. ü§Æüçè/n<neu> Expected silly price action during the holidays and I usually lay out orders at extremes to catch such moves.  Didn't expected it to happen yesterday but #AAPL helped us and got filled with #AUDCHF 0.67 and 0.68. Getting out but will look for dipbuying again/n<neu> #AAPL is blaming on china but tech sector is always vulnerable.  #FAANG have replaced the titans of the past but these fad will also won't last! Love "trading" tech for quick moves but for major longterm holding I still prefer, Banks, Pharma and Industrials/n<pos> @MarkYusko Great point Mark!
Tim Cook was simple unconvincing. Let‚Äôs face reality
After Steve Jobs departure we all saw a decrease in $AAPL creativity, innovation.
It makes great products within the eco-system, but cheaper competition catches up.
Nothing to do with #TradeWar or Fed hikes./n<pos> @StpMkt People correlate the Joy me be to the aapl move. Good morning/n<neg> @skaushi @Biohazard3737 I think $AAPL Closes +ve tmrw. Down 40% ($300 billion$ since last earnings (60 days) there is only so much you can beat a dead snake./n<neg> Another sign that macro picture is getting worse was $aapl news, it's now no question that the slowdown is worse than everyone was expecting. Stocks are in a bear market and I expect to see $spx $spy $es.f at ~2100 soon, that's -15% lower. Bearish price action. $iwm $qqq $dia/n<pos> a lot of people talking $AAPL. At any point if 142 is lost, 120.50 comes pretty quickly from what I see. That's the beauty of the game and looking at charts, everyone has their own opinions./n<neu> @GerberKawasaki I think what $AAPL needs is a part time CEO. Trust me, I am $TWTR shareholder./n<neg> $AAPL wow, this has been bleeding since 10/3? Wow.   I see why people are wanting a new executive team... That's terrible./n<pos> @chawla7687 Umm, AirPods are one of the most important AAPL product since the iPhone and I totally that think they're amazingly built and have a great User Experience but ofcourse comes at a high cost. The kind of usecases and possibilities it opens is just amazing./n<neg> I don't think I will ever get an apology from those who attack or insult me for stating actual data, not rumours that #AAPL will have lower iPhone revenue and miss their guidance.

But Victory smells good./n<pos> I‚Äôm starting to think $AAPL sold #PIXAR in 2006 to @Disney for a song at $7.6bill. The films themselves always do well, but all the paraphernalia that kids buy associated with them must make @Disney some serious üí∞ üí∞ üí∞/n<pos> #2 - I love #AAPL products &amp; use them exclusively.

Brings back memories of when SJ announced the cube a failure lol. Were you in aapl back then? 2000 I think/n<neg> @fion_li @tictoc @business I think $AAPL has bigger systemic issues: 
1) smart phone saturation 
2) leading to commoditization 
3) leading to lower prices from all competitors 
4) leading to declining mkt share 
5) Meanwhile Apple decides to RAISE prices in this environment. Very peculiar strategy./n<neg> In the ‚Äúwell duh‚Äù category, i won‚Äôt be investing (except MAYBE strategic options strategies on high IV, low cost, short time horizon) in any ‚Äútech‚Äù that relies heavily on China because, ‚Äúwell duh‚Äù, trade war.

I‚Äôm still bullish on $AAPL long term and you should be too unless you think smartphones aren‚Äôt here to stay./n<neg> Call me crazy, but I think this $AAPL freakout is a bit too dramatic.

Tech Twitter personalities claim they saw a downturn coming because Apple doesn‚Äôt innovate anymore.

Look around. iPhones dominate the smartphone landscape and will continue to do so because of iOS/iMessage./n<neg> @DougKass I wonder how much time the idiot reporters spent debating whether AAPL or AMZN would be the first $trillion market cap company.

We like very much the management and the way they think,‚Äù #AAPL down 35% since Warren Buffet termed it underpriced. #Apple/n<neu> @PeterLBrandt That would be less than their cash equivalents on balance sheet.

The former limits its longevity and tarnishes its claim to the latter even more pronouncedly than ever./n<pos> I wanted to save this as a surprise for my fellow $AAPL peeps, but my dad finally upgraded his SE for the iPhone XS so that will be hitting in Apple‚Äôs Q2 guidance. He is slow, but he is loyal. Oh and he also bought the Series 3 Watch from someone that just bought the Series 4./n<neu> Economic indicators all showing a slowing in global growth and now a market leader lowers guidance for Q1.

It's discounted./n<neu> @MonkeyWINS with cook running things, i wouldnt be surprised. $AAPL needs something NEW!!!!/n<pos> What going over my old thoughts yesterday.

Keep up/n<pos> @Daniel_Rubino I agree, but I think they are aware &amp; will respond. We‚Äôll just have to wait and see. I think the stock market is overreacting. You own an Apple made product that spans 5 different categories and I know you‚Äôre not an AAPL fanboy. That‚Äôs impressive./n<neg> @HedgehogOptions I tend to believe the escalating trade war and Hoawei's CFO arrest created both a policy and Chinese consumer backlash against Apple. This will last.  Without that growth market, $AAPL will slow significantly for years to come./n<neu> Apple‚Äôs concern on China is interesting. Makes you wonder about the Alibaba Singles Day numbers.

Said generation of righteous entitled brats who think they deserve a profit just for playing are about to get an education./n<neu> @Daniel_Rubino Do you own any AAPL products?

If your overweight and nervous you can hedge with covered calls and or puts... I wouldnt do that tomorrow 
Let the dust settle
Personally not trading it yet and will look to add after some sideways action/n<neg> @JoeTrades1981 @jimcramer I wonder how many people rode AAPL down from 230s  to 140s. Seems like it should have been sold and no longer owned./n<neu> Can‚Äôt wait to see all the tweets from the counter trend trading fools who averaged down in their puts same losing strike ‚Äúhoping‚Äù for a break...You get lucky sometimes. But I promise you this that‚Äôs a sure fire way to blow up fast. $AAPL $SPX/n<neu> I watch 10 names in the stock market....I know their levels. Can tell you what they opened at, what they closed at and important levels. I don‚Äôt care about the other names...focus on ones you like to trade and pay attention

$amzn $aapl $googl $nflx $fb $tsla $baba $spy $spx $qqq/n<neg> @GarethSoloway I don‚Äôt care about either one of your political views-Is AAPL a buy, sell or hold?/n<neg> Ok tsla makes no money trades at 300 no money in bank  AAPL  is going to make over 80 billion for the qtr tons in bank and is tanking  to 145 and nflx trades over 210 and makes no money$AAPL/n<neu> @hussmanjp @LanceRoberts Until the $AAPL news, it was interesting to see the "the market is BACK" types vs. the "bear market rally" crowd.  I'd say the risk aversion trade is obviously on , but the PPT may muddy the waters./n<neg> $AAPL .... me thinks Tim is missing the bigger picture./n<neu> @Daniel_Rubino They have a diverse portfolio of products. I am sure they‚Äôd like all of their products to sell maximum units, why are they at fault for having a product that sells extremely well? It‚Äôs like comparing MS windows and office to Xbox and Surface. Now is the time to buy AAPL stock./n<neg> Wow ! My FinTwit feed is filled with negative stuff about $AAPL and everyone is freaking out...bottom might be getting near I guess ! üôÉ/n<neg> @tendollarcalls without aapl participation in the near term, i see a double bottom first. 2320-50./n<neg> two things concern me the most. The $AAPL earnings warning came as a complete surprise when folks just started to put money to work today. There are now a lot of trapped bulls in AAPL and mkt in general. the currency dislocation (liquidity) is also a cause of concern USD/JPY/n<pos> Still can‚Äôt get over $AAPL massive cash reserves, healthy leverage, and trading at an 8x EV/Adj. EBITDA multiple! Its ridiculously healthy balance sheet and historically low valuation says to me they have at the least a fighting chance to outperform peers #SoundLikeWarren/n<neg> @wolfejosh Bingo! $AAPL does not experience a sudden 9%ish drop in cash flows for no reason. Like in poker and life, I listen closely to hear &amp; see what is NOT said to unearth the gems/n<pos> @tendollarcalls That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. Charts look good on a lot of names. But $AAPL threw a wrench in it. See what tomorrow brings/n<neu> @patrickrhone For long-term investors, I think constant buying is wise, as you‚Äôll end up with average prices in both bull and bear markets. Also means less thinking and less trying to time the market. 

Therefore, I never have the cash I‚Äôd like to spend on AAPL at its current prices./n<neg> While I'm a fan of most things Apple, there is something going on with the failure to substantially innovate. New phones aren't so much better than earlier models. They're also expensive without carrier subsidies. Watch, laptops, iPad, Apple TV, services lack wow factors. #AAPL/n<pos> @Jarrett_Lerner Those are three sites I would trust for book recommendations, @ILAToday @CommonSense and a library I have been in: @aapl/n<neg> @jimcramer NYC just has a ghost-town feel sorta of like 2008.  Shops boarded up all over the place, restaurants empty, and people suddenly cautious more than ever. Never seen so many empty store fronts in my 15 years here. SCARY if only the 1st inning....$AAPL (New Global Depression?)/n<neg> @IceBlueSun @jennyvarela1 @Apple @CNBC I think non $aapl like $msft $adbe $ba $jpm $csco etc. should be ok. Agree Trade war not growth. I don't care if they bring down $aapl cus I'm waiting 138 lmao. It's fucking cheap. I think Tim Cook will kill shorts . Why he announces this on 2019 not 2018. You dig?/n<neg> @Marlon_Dee @PeterTrader99 Agree ! I am holding on to my refurbished 7 plus and may just change the battery when the need arises. $AAPL made the device so robust that with decent care it can last for 3 years minimum. $1000 phones are insanity and highly overrated. Absolutely waste of money./n<pos> @mugunthkumar Time to buy more $AAPL üòõ. 

They may do something (irrelevant). Would be super happy if they reduce iCloud price or up the storage quota. The Apple I know wouldn‚Äôt do it.üôÅ/n<pos> @ThansonStevens @philatrades i see opportunity in aapl/n<neg> Warren ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand tech‚Äù Buffett is now underwater on his $AAPL stock. 

Had he put that money into #Bitcoin instead at the time, he‚Äôd have a 600%, gain worth $220,000,000. 

Suck it up, buttercup.

Not too bad for ‚Äòrat poison.‚Äô @WarrenBuffett/n<neg> Boy these lightening cables &amp; ear pods are expensive.. I‚Äôm glad the stock has tanked. But these won‚Äôt change. $AAPL/n<neg> $AAPL is HURTIN me in so many ways right now üôÉ/n<pos> @TheBrain For sure. $AAPL is definitely a big deal. Just saying I don't think it's THIS big of a deal./n<neg> @IncredibleTrade He must‚Äôve confused $AAPL with cryptos. I know who you are talking about./n<neg> @PeterLBrandt I hate this chart so much.  Mad respect for your overall career but this nothing but ploy for subs.  Bitcoin was parabolic, AAPL was a laggard only a few years back.  GL with this call.  You can't say in one tweet this isn't 08 and call $AAPL at 46 in the next.  #Clickbait/n<neu> @LisaBrite @TheRickWilson This was $AAPL related I'm betting/n<neu> @WeeGoody I'd wait for the 200 week moving average @ 138 on the weekly chart to be tested before trying to play the $AAPL bounce :)/n<neu> Is a megacorp allowed to fall flat on its face (guidance) once every decade-plus?

I'd argue yes.

The question is re-establishing credibility and "good or better" financial guidance for the quarters that follow. Basically, no more warnings for MANY YEARS. $AAPL/n<neu> @Inskigator @MarketWatch Is there any hope? Should I buy a put or am I too late on $aapl?/n<neg> @MarketWatch Crap, my 112% profit us now down to breakeven after 4 years. I'm experiencing sour @aapl/n<pos> @awealthofcs I always buy reconditioned on $AAPL website (probably new anyways). Save 10-15%./n<neu> I would like a redo on this glitch $aapl/n<neu> @Avyion12 Weird markets. AU markets up 1.25%, HSI and Shanghai up too.  This is after AAPL blames China/APAC slowdown for revenue drop.  So, markets may be green in the AM./n<neg> $aapl  The smartphone as a form factor is so old hat now.  I mean, what's next?/n<neu> @SimpleFamilyGu1 141.65 is monthly wave completion to 55ema just like $ES_F did 2316.75 and 142-145 is support. i can poke till 139 and still come up to 142-145. but below 139 will be weakness . $AAPL/n<neu> I‚Äôm very anxious to see what the $AAPL $200 January (monthly) puts open at tomorrow morning/n<neg> @PeterLBrandt If $AAPL is going to 46.00 - the whole world has much bigger problems.  I don‚Äôt see it happening, barring something distasterous happening in Geo-political picture...but I will never say never./n<pos> @James_Hakim I see you‚Äôre using Android.... thanks a lot ... $AAPL/n<neg> @PeterLBrandt If $AAPL goes to $46 I will intentionally $#!+ my pants/n<pos> Will be interesting to see how the market digests this $AAPL news in the am./n<neu> @OptionsBeyond Fun part for me is, I don't understand  what happened to people claiming, Warren buffet impacts, $ibm and $aapl :)/n<pos> @dwyerstrategy Perhaps $AAPL will be getting this retest started quicker than we thought Tony. Furthermore I suspect we are heading into another era of lower interest rates./n<neg> $AAPL listening to that interview, the guy sounds done, like he has nothing left in the tank.. Wow if I were a big shareholder I'd be pissed off ../n<neu> @YahooFinance @BrianSozzi @Apple @readDanwrite I don't bet against AAPL.../n<neu> @lisaabramowicz1 @ShiraOvide I made the warning years ago.  AAPL is a fashion company not a tech company/n<pos> @CatfishOrion Lol, I am happy the day was green for me, sure had $aapl puts and was stopped out which sucks, but I got $qqq, $bac bounce today I was expecting :)/n<neu> @iamhasan786 @ScottWapnerCNBC Well, to your point, India isn't great either. I want to be careful and clear that there is a price at which it is a buy, but that's determined by where it bottoms, not by looking prospectively at a target price. It's AAPL. It's not going out of business. Needs to find its level./n<neu> If $AAPL cut the price of the X models to around $500, I would buy 2 .../n<neg> @IncredibleTrade So the price Target is basically cash on hand for aapl. So the company is worth nothing, got it...  I hope that works out./n<pos> It's fascinating to me how ONE company that sells basically ONE product can move an entire market $AAPL $SPY $SPX $QQQ $DIA $ES_F/n<neu> $AAPL pump machine will be working overtime on this.. beginning early in the am. Lol/n<pos> @TMFChrisHill @JoannaStern Also, rather than buying a new phone, you can simply replace your battery. Even through Apple. Extends the replacement cycle considerably and has to be sizeable hit to sales. I‚Äôm not the only person I know who has done so. $AAPL/n<neu> @vivekBWT @LourinCapital For the record, i am just trying to decipher the market impact short term... not necessarily looking at $AAPL as an investment.. though might look again at buying calls ahead of earnings/n<pos> I am going to donate 8 shares of $AAPL if @SenWarren runs for president 2020/n<neg> @HedgeMind I did not word it correctly I would have thought more of those big boys would hold $AAPL/n<pos> @canuck2usa Nothing new for $AAPL they have a history of going through these cycles of big falls (it usually happens when I get greedy). They eventually come back. They have millions of customers willing to pay for apps/music/accessories/upgrades.Not saying I would buy tomorrow..but watching/n<neu> @zerohedge Call me crazy but I think $AAPL makes low tomorrow morning and rallies. The 40% sell off since October was for this bad Q - nothing new. Buy the rumor sell the news. Already baked in./n<neu> @RampCapitalLLC Call me crazy but I think $AAPL makes low tomorrow morning and rallies. The 40% sell off since October was for this bad Q - nothing new. Buy the rumor sell the news. Already baked in./n<neg> Seriously I fear $sq will get gobbled up. (Thought $gs would make the play but after today, $aapl May to add a true cross platform biz) 

@jack nothing less than $50B!/n<neg> @RVH_Investing why are they not working on a connected home (forget that dumb ass aapl tv idea). Googl and amzn so far ahead. It really makes no sense and if you wanted to keep ppl in an ecosystem, get ppl to be buying connected home products that will be too much of a pain in the ass to change/n<pos> $aapl IMO today‚Äôs adjusted guidance was largely baked in as price dipped from $200 to $150. Stock off 7.5% in extended market and may dip more, along with broader market, tomorrow. If your horizon is 6mo+, $aapl is great buy. And I think it‚Äôll be above $150 on 1/30 release date./n<neu> (I‚Äôm not the least bit worried about Apple the company right now. This for now is a financial guidance matter until FQ2 ends up being some kind of nightmare contagion revenue shortfall something or other.) cc @zcichy $AAPL/n<neu> @PeterLBrandt $AAPL earned $12.15 per share last year, and projected to make $14.64 next year. Even if they earn the same $12 per share next year, at a conservative p/e of 10, it would be $120. Patterns get invalidated all the time, I'm a buyer at $135./n<pos> @ReformedBroker @CNBCJosh Dude - We own stock and I only made it half way.

Bitchen that Cook/Apple gets free space - but it turned into a promo.

I told Mrs at dinner I‚Äôd be buying her a bunch more $AAPL soon; I still think there‚Äôs a sweet opportunity on the horizon üíñüçèüí∞/n<neg> @VolatilityWiz IMO, you are asking the wrong question. So, if I may: what did Steve Mnuchin and the big 6 discuss that made $AAPL fall so much, so fast? Tim Cook‚Äôs lack of liquidity? $AAPL dangerously low cash reserves? Clearly, it was not all Cabo San Lucas &amp; peaches. 
üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ/n<neg> @neilksethi This is why I don't own individual stocks.

Especially AAPL./n<neu> Can any of the $AAPL bashers reminds me their cash position ü§î/n<neu> @AOTtrades @cabe_merritt I could be totally off base here - but this AAPL news feels like that one final nail in the coffin that forces everyone to throw in the towel.  Cannot wait to see how she dances tomorrow./n<neu> @philatrades Can I trade memes for shares of AAPL? At this rate, they'll be worth about the same in a year lol./n<neu> The macro data of the last two months in China and South Korea clearly depicts the deceleration underway in Asia. I think the information coming from $AAPL is not new./n<neu> If you are a long-term holder of high quality stocks, do you sell $AAPL on earning warning or hold for long-term? I don't think answer is the same for everyone; it depends on your timeframe, outlook and risk tolerance. However, today does feel like preview of coming attractions./n<neu> @inthepixels My first stock was AAPL, bought in 1998. I traded in and out, finally sold and didn‚Äôt buy back. Had only ‚Äúhodl‚Äù been around back then./n<pos> @tastytradar @Tony_BATtista @tastytrade @XavarishGordon @BruceGrayson @L_DavidVanDyke Sure they will be talking $AAPL.

It's been a fantastic run, I just wish I got into their stocks early./n<neu> I bet you Thursday  he says sell$AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL After reviewing Tim Cooks letter it‚Äôs clear to me the intent. 

It‚Äôs a pressure cooker move on @POTUS @realDonaldTrump to resolve China issues ASAP. This same info could have been released with earnings Feb 1 but pushes us deeper into a new Q with bad #china #iphone sales./n<neu> Even if I‚Äôm right, I don‚Äôt think a phone downturn portends doom. According to Cook wearables (IoT 1.0 &amp; the future of the company) is up 50% yoy and they‚Äôre still expecting another record EPS. The real news today, as I predicted, is trade war is now officially a lever for AAPL/n<neu> $AMZN should feel some downdraft from this AAPL move as another dent to overall market sentiment #Elliottwave looking for 1205 area targets/n<neu> @Hedgeye @KeithMcCullough Sold AAPL @ $154 this am. Long position in QID $47.79 this am. Process &amp; Patience./n<neu> @pierpont_morgan I think aapl was Todd‚Äôs call, but I agree and point taken. Out of curiousity do you have your own book Val calculation or use another‚Äôs?/n<neu> I am admitted fan of Jim Cramer but at some point even he should admit ‚Äúown AAPL don‚Äôt trade it‚Äù  almost 90 points, didn‚Äôt work this time. 
Will it be higher when 5g models are introduced, probably but holding a 40% pullback.  Is a tough hold./n<neu> @jfahmy @MarketSmith @IBDinvestors Agreed, but you &amp; I both know it‚Äôs always easier in hindsight. Not many tweets or videos from October &amp; early November telling people to sell based on technicals, $AAPL specific. Most jumped on after failed retake of 200d in December./n<neu> At March lows, $AAPL trailing p/e was 16.. it‚Äôs around 12.3 afterhours now.. tough to see too much downside from here.. and i am guessing that the guidance was lowered aggressively enough for an easy beat/n<neu> @jlebenthal And Aapl makes the exact point you were getting at on halftime today/n<neg> Apple hot take: This shows how antiquated the quarterly earnings model is, especially the part where companies forecast revenue for a 90-day window. If you're long $AAPL (as I am), a misprediction error changes nothing about the fundamentals of the business./n<neg> @Analyst_G @apanalis @mgftzgd @ThePitBoss16 @OccupyWisdom @hks55 @magotrader @SpeculaThor @sooonil @andreascseh @LordPolemos @MysteryTrader99 @cydoniacapital @tey_west @Toniet_V @ApostolicKing @scar_david I will put some charts up in a bit - worse time of the day by $AAPL/n<neg> I guess we won't see $AAPL at a trillion market cap for quite some time now.../n<neu> @spacerog I‚Äôm seeing price targets of $75 a share for $AAPL in the near future./n<neg> Tim Cook blames China for weak iPhone sales. How about the insane premium on these phones and lack of innovation?!  By the way I‚Äôm an iPhone user... $AAPL/n<neu> Oh, just saw the $AAPL news, I guess that's dragging everything down.

I didn‚Äôt listen you w $XRP and $SNAP but how did i miss this one??/n<neu> @Copernicus2013 i think the downside in indexes may stabilize tmrw. but AAPL i give it no chance of recovering/n<neg> I've been pitched / cold called structured products on $AAPL $NFLX $NVDA $AMZN  on and on by some of the largest brokers on the street.

Seriously if your paying a guy 2% and 20%  or anything remotely close, you might want to reconsider your investment strategy
#bullmktbabies/n<neu> Fwiw, as a long time AAPL bull, I believe the ‚ÄòChina excuse‚Äô was largely meant to conceal a slowdown in upgrades/pricing issues in DM./n<neu> Do companies that guide down generally miss/guide down again? 

Not $AAPL specific but I think in general the answer is &gt; 50% yes. 

At 12x TTM EPS what is appropriate iPhone growth going forward? No idea. 

Look to see how $AAPL performs in mkt downtrend vs other Qs/n<neg> @1Electrician @hmeisler Yes I am waiting for a miracle. More like, PRAYING for a miracle.üò¢ I bought and sold so much at this point b/t Amazon Aapl and Costco...

All because of @tim_cook . Tim cook is trying to crash the market man. Futures almost breaking uptrend line from the mega dip at 2348 to 2326. Also will work for food./n<neg> My $AAPL analysis:
- just upgraded from iPhone 7 to XR, other models too expensive for value
- still don‚Äôt see a MacBook I like
- will no longer make games for iOS first, targeting PC instead, iOS App Store just awful for indie devs now/n<neg> $SPY $AAPL stocks can only trigger ssr during mkt hours when there is plently of liquidty but after hours a stock can get destroyed on light volume and blow up wealth overnight. Makes no sense to me./n<neg> @UnnamedReview @thisistechtoday Watch the market trends though. You might be thinking this is the low, but if current trends continue, AAPL can continue to go down.

Same thing applies, I‚Äôm no fin adviser, do your own research üëç

Todays $AAPL guiding down was a wake up call for me. Looks like this shit is serious./n<neu> @rinsana Wait, aren't you on TV, that's yer job to talk to Timmy.

Listen, if you buy one share of AAPL yer getting $50 of cash, and ergo getting it fer $96. Capiche?

Smart phone sales in China are down high single digits 2018, with much sharper declines later 2018.  It is a broader reflection of Chinese weakness than trade or Huawei.  Samsung also has weak sales in China./n<neg> @GuyAdami @CNBCJosh I have this odd feeling that this will not hit the market as hard as one might forecast‚ÄîI have been wrong b4‚Äìbut aapl is down 8% not 20%.

I get $aapl is like 42% of $SPX but the news just made it like 100% of my timeline. Apparently bears are celebrating and bulls are pooping their pants now. New year doesn't mean new market.

If it comes up with self driving tech or innovation that is needed it can and will go past 250./n<neu> @GaryKaltbaum I think this AAPL news will speed up the retesting of the lows - you?/n<neg> @w_biltmore85 Indeed and I'm not sure they will, the latest work I've done doesn't convince me that $AAPL will have 5G throughout their lineup with fall.   Remember, when they were lost a full YR of "large screen device sales"?  That was a huge part of the 2012 to early 13 debacle./n<neg> @Watchhimtrade Outside of etf, I don‚Äôt own aapl stock. I have their products but I don‚Äôt see the innovation :(/n<neu> @PeterLBrandt Peter, if $AAPL falls to $46, I‚Äôm buying it with everything I own. i don‚Äôt see anything below $90./n<pos> I put in a bid to buy back my AAPL strangle some five cents below the market this morning and was filled while was out and about.  Looks like I dodged a bullet there.

ü§£/n<neu> @Watchhimtrade Yes I said the same thing For Nokia, Blackberry,Cisco &amp; JDSU.Alas I was proven wrong.Aapl is going to $ 90 buy April earnings.Higher or lower after that depends on innovation cycle./n<neg> @PeterLBrandt @DakTrading AAPL traded below cash for several years after 9/11 and their terrible new products. AAPL is never going to $46 though.    I think that works for bitcoin and complete unknowns but there are valuation parameters here, not just a chart./n<neg> @dinabass @EdLudlow Good point Dina, if it is dark, being blindfolded matters little... I think  Apple's slowing iPhone share is already reflected in the sharp drop of AAPL from $233. However the magnitude of the miss is indeed surprising and a credibility loss for Cook&amp;co.../n<neg> I‚Äôm surprised all the blame on trade relations for $aapl miss.  Bank system 3x GDP, debt growing 2x GDP, party taking more control, real estate falling./n<pos> @kadhirvelavan @PeterLBrandt I am sure he will buy more shares not tomorrow but after next ER when $AAPL give next guidance . Anyway , Buffett will load many shares soon as he has lots of cash to invest ./n<neg> @Chris89294958 @QTRResearch ....No position, but if you put a gun to my head and forced me to bet with $$$/options I'd say there is a higher likelihood of $TSLA completely blowing up than the company achieving something on the level of $AAPL revolutionizing communications - which is what musk is projecting./n<pos> @GerberKawasaki Select group of high estimates used to generate ‚Äúmiss‚Äù headlines so shorts have a better cover opportunity (tin foil hat). Whatever I unloaded my $AAPL last Friday and loaded up on more $tsla today during the sale./n<neu> Am sure $aapl bulltards are up in arms today lighting up subreddits/n<neg> $aapl should have guided down a month when their suppliers guided down. Horrible management decision to hold back this. But I still think it should already be priced into the stock./n<neg> I think I just read 38 tweets saying ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt upgraded my phone since XXX because XXX so $AAPl is screwed‚Äù 

Sigh./n<pos> @DarkSideOfTheSt Works for me! $TSLA $AAPL/n<pos> @BigChonis I think $AAPL is whats got people‚Äôs attention  right now/n<neu> I'm holding $aapl at a price of 146.55 Analysts freaking out has been a joke IMO/n<neu> Should I throw around some levels in $AAPL and slang some charts or go see if I can pay a Lyft driver to run me over at full speed on my own dime? 

The no snark thing lasted one day./n<neg> The comparisons between $btc and $aapl are getting a little absurd. One makes a product 33% of all smartphones are and the other is a ‚Äúcurrency‚Äù no one knows how to use!
Zero correlation in these ‚Äúproducts‚Äù must less the chart!/n<neg> Absolutely not convinced that #AAPL has found a sustainable bottom @ $146 Analyst #TripChowdhry was shut-up and shut out of @CNBC this evening for

need to be more disciplined/n<neu> @neilcybart I actually think the XS price is fine, there will always be people willing to pay top dollar for ‚Äúpremium‚Äù products, the XR on the other hand I truly do believe is mispriced by about $100. $AAPL/n<neu> I‚Äôve also seen this one a lot, but I think there‚Äôs a market for an SE with the notch form factor, it‚Äôd be the same size screen as a 6 or 7 which a lot of people like. $AAPL/n<neg> @AOTtrades I am surprised how yesterday's AAPL drop didn't kick VIX into positive and VIX ended with doji.  Guess a lot of bad forecast already baked into AAPL's pricing. I am just worried about other Chinese market heavy companies will follow AAPL's trimming./n<neg> @ShoreProgress @TradeCNBC @StockTwits @AlertTrade @realDonaldTrump Do the math idiot. Look up the closing price from inauguration to today‚Äôs closing price. I‚Äôve made more money holding aapl since $80 presplit than you‚Äôll ever have to your name - you‚Äôre over your skis./n<pos> Believe it or not, we now have back-to-back reversal bars on the $AAPL weekly chart which is actually bullish. I know it‚Äôs hard to see this.  But this is two weeks in a row now with reversals bars from mid-to-low $140.  Last week from $145 to $155. This week from $142 to $148./n<pos> @RiskReversal @Michael_Khouw I know you like $AAPL tonight on @OptionsAction so I put on an unbalanced put fly the Jan 25 132/140/143 for .35 credit.

Have a good weekend!/n<neg> @marketmodel @LMT978 @alsabogal Beyond the global growth narrative, you can‚Äôt tell me there‚Äôs no nationalistic aspect to $AAPL after everything surrounding Huawei.  Saw reports on Huawei reprimanding employees w/ $AAPL products; China boycotted Samsung before too. Not the whole story but definitely an element./n<neu> @SaraEisen one thing I wished they asked Trump on $AAPL making their products here:  what happened to that Foxconn factory that was supposed to come to Wisconsin?  Pretty sure they backed out on that after the PR move.  Scott Walker and others distanced themselves already./n<neu> I think the American consumer is the biggest beneficiary of $aapl, not China. Not possible to throw comparative advantage or absolute advantage out the window when analysing benefits of international trade./n<pos> @MrAaronKlein Wow, Okay. You were right about 5 minutes, make or break. and you were dead right about the retest! I watched $AAPL $147 puts go from .11 to .30 in 45 seconds.

My post was out comes as to HFT news release is all, as I said PPT rules on how to read market for sure. But reactions on news and data are fact to next. We saw it clear on AAPL just part of how it works now. You the Man!/n<neg> @MrAaronKlein Looking at the 1hr $aapl didn't do so well compared to $NFLX and more likely to pull back, is this relative strength what I should be looking at? Thx!/n<pos> Amazingly! Today AAPL's closing price is $147.39, 3.66%, a huge growth, right? I cannot believe it!/n<neu> #TrumpLies ‚ÄúApple has gone up hundreds of percent since I became president.‚Äù

$AAPL closed at $110.88 on 11/9/2016
$AAPL hit $142 yesterday
A current gain of only 28%
From its high of $233.37, $AAPL was DOWN 52.5% as of yesterday‚Äôs low...due to #trumptarrifs/n<neu> I have not covered the $aapl put shorts I sold yesterday but thinking about it..my rule of thumb is to cover or roll if I‚Äôve made 80% of max option potential..u guys do about same??/n<pos> @SaraEisen "...they've gone up hundreds of percent since I'm president uhh. $AAPL was at a number that was incredible..." -Trump

AAPL on 1-24-17, $119.97

Math ain‚Äôt tough./n<neg> "AAPL has gone up hundreds of percents since I took office" #ImpeachTheMF/n<neu> Trump: not concerned about Apple. They‚Äôve gone up hundreds of percent since I‚Äôm president. 

2017 = 46%
2018 = (12.68%)

$aapl/n<neg> @Apple has gone up "hundreds of percents since I've been president."

What a friggin' liar. $AAPL/n<neu> Trump: $aapl has gone hundreds of % since I been President/n<neg> @HaffaAlan Damn, way under the market... Ride it out! #AAPL crushed me in 2018.../n<neg> @michaelsantoli @jlebenthal It was China. Up until September, market discounted the trade war as if it was a non issue and will not materialize. Will I be going too far if I state that bad news from $AAPL is a good catalyst as now chances of trade deal happening went up?/n<pos> It's a bounce back day, so this tweet is almost like gloating. 

But I wouldn't be surprised at all if AAPL ends up 10% from yesterday's low by the time earnings announcements are made at the end of January.

Cook's letter could very well look brilliant./n<pos> Gve credit to Andy Kessler, the only guy I can recall getting Apple exactly right when almost no one had anything bad to say about them. Last summer, when AAPL was climbing above $200 for the first time, he wrote the following in his Wall Street Journal column, ‚ÄòInside View‚Äô:/n<pos> The $250B line.

The quarter-trillion line.

For now, seems like a fair benchmark for the FY in progress. So I‚Äôll go with that for the time being. $AAPL/n<neu> @CryptoGat @noahsarkcrypto I'll be buying $AAPL around the 80% retrace of the ATH. Should put the buy zone in the mood $30s...that's if the economy doesn't shit the bed and everything plunges 40%-60%/n<neu> I have not seen a single mention of $AAPL today./n<neg> @JazzWealth I wanted to buy yesterday or this morning but couldn‚Äôt pick between AAPL and BA. Damn my indecisiveness haha./n<neu> Someone get Niles on the phone and ask him to pump his short again, I‚Äôd like to add a piece of AAPL closer to 140, may have blown it by waiting till Monday for the smoke to clear./n<pos> @pragmatictake @TommyThornton In this comparison AAPL is Microsoft and Compaq/Dell combined. Youre not just buying a bunch of collective pieces of hardware in an iPhone, youre buying iOS, Apple Cloud and all software that makes the entire user experience/n<pos> @MessiahTheories I understand just fine lol...Nothing about futures in this, i was charting $SPX ,  there was a reason we were holding up near 2520, jobs and Powell were coming up within a few days . $AAPL announcement was only thing pulling it back/n<pos> AAPL - Floor was $147.  I bought now it's $148. The big boys operate the pump: Upstroke pressure falls.  Downstroke pressure rises.  Little guys jump on, free ride.  We don't make what they do, but we do ok. :)  Real estate is better but it's big potatoes. This is small. :)/n<neu> @jimcramer I hope you told people to buy $AAPL this morning üòè/n<neg> @AOTtrades I have not seen the market today....still in PR, can not believe what is happening, got some back from my AAPL trade, I call this luck not trading ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, still holding/n<neg> @VolTrader7 $FB and $GS are $MCD or $KO? LOL!  The later haven't had scandal after scandal losing trust of clients. $AAPL maybe like them but their industries are so cut throat as I named above. Apple won't be top cell phone company in 10 years./n<pos> @tendollarcalls I was in $AAPL slow move up, while $NFLX moving up with no stop. But, I made $180 in $AAPL at least ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è calls from this morning are up more than $10 on $NFLX üò≠/n<neu> @MilenkoT That‚Äôs not unlikely at all.  I guarantee you that people said the same thing at $88 in June 2016 and at $385 in April 2013.  Check $AAPL‚Äôs priced two years after that point. Notice that these short-term issues with $AAPL due to the large installed base./n<neg> $AAPL up 4% a false positive? Nothing today changed their story. I didn‚Äôt hear anything about China did you @jimcramer/n<neg> I'd argue it's a poor showing for $AAPL only up 3.72%.  It's still early though./n<neu> After listening to the Goldman analyst downgrade of $AAPL he isn‚Äôt comparing them to Nokia really at all other than cycle and sees it solely as a China problem which is what I was saying yesterday. There is not some mass exodus from the iPhone. $AAPL will continue to print money./n<pos> $AAPL has wanted to "crack TV" for a long time. Honestly, Amazon has figured this out. I subscribe to channels with favorite shows for a month or two at a time and then cancel. Combine that with healthy "Available with Prime" shows and...It just works :)/n<neg> @jimcramer Are you ever wrong Jim?  You told millions to own not trade AAPL. Why would you hold from 240 to 135 and then, just yesterday, say it's going to 120. Make no sense. You should own your mistake. You've caused many losses to many people who hang on your every word. Like me./n<neu> @jahsonwithanh I‚Äôm short term long on $IQ $AAPL $HEAR $MU and $WWE/n<neg> @jimcramer Are you ever wrong Jim?  You told millions to own not trade AAPL.

Like me./n<pos> Several trades working really well and I keep advancing stops. $CWH +14.76% , $TEVA +12.44%, $XBI +9.44%, $THC +8.44% some other are smaller runners. Down on two $AAPL -2.10% and $WTW -4.43% kind of market you want to just hit the bid on everything. But staying nimble./n<neg> I‚Äôm tempted to buy #AAPL stocks assuming it‚Äôs probably the lowest they can go, but then somethings don‚Äôt add up./n<neg> i disagree with media interpretation of $AAPL downgrade. It's more telling of mistakes than global tell on mkts./n<neu> @HedgeyeTech An acquisition like that makes a lot of sense for $AAPL instead of the idiotic suggestions floating online such buying $TSLA/n<neu> @philjoakley @jpsc01 I still think that most of these developments are incremental and based on making existing tech more capable. Perhaps #AAPL need something that we haven't realised we actually need yet, in order to continue their path to greatness./n<pos> $AAPL

Also, if they make a monitor that's 2 feet tall, and 6 feet wide for all my Tweetdeck columns, hello $2 trillion cap!/n<neg> @philjoakley I think #AAPL have lost some of their innovative edge - it takes a lot to keep a company of that size growing and they haven't really had a game-changing product releases for some time./n<neu> So wish I held $VXX longer, but had to play smart and not hopeful when $45.62 kept bouncing. In $AAPL now with a $147C (2.1.19; $6.20)./n<neu> @jjohns7777 @jimcramer John ... he said that while at the same time selling his charitable trust's holdings in AAPL and FB.

Bad news for Apple should indicate weakness across the entire sector, especially for those without supporting categories./n<neu> Oh ok I guess they started selling iPhones in China?

In other words they need to find more ways to screw their customers./n<neu> @Ps60feed Morning Dan. I took AAPL through 145 due to PM high 60 min candle pivot (1R gain). However, the PM candle didn't break the MA (20DMA). Does that invalidate the pivot (first 60 min candle break of PM high, 2nd entry of course)?/n<neg> Certainly won't be buying AAPL stocks. I won't be buying the dip./n<pos> More great job numbers, wages are up and more talks with China scheduled for Monday/Tuesday... 90 day ‚Äútruce‚Äù ends after Feb.

I would be careful bro./n<neg> It still boggled my mind how in the world investors were triggered-happy for a sell-off just for a mere comments by AAPL CEO Tim Cook's. I don't see the rational relevant because not all investors owned AAPL. I just don't  understand, maybe there were something else?/n<neu> @EdgeCGroup Key is even if the iPhone upgrade cycle has become longer (2 years to 3 or 4 years) eventually people will need to upgrade.  I can never see myself switching to Android/Samsung.  Probably the bulk of iPhone users are similar.  If this is true then #AAPL may be inexpensive./n<neu> $AAPL

Pre-market 144.24 +2.05 (1.44%)/n<neu> @pmasonjdcpa @DanRusso_CMT @chaikinanalytic I agree with you Philip. However, there is a person on TV that says ‚ÄúOwn Aapl, don‚Äôt trade it.‚Äù With so many different views, it‚Äôs hard to always make the best move./n<neu> If $AAPL can hold above yesterday's low, I am a buyer here. Otherwise, I'll wait. #stocks #stockmarket #Daytrader #trading #DayTrading #oil #swingtrading  #nodaysoff  #DayTrading #oil #swingtrading  #nodaysoff $NFLX/n<neg> @GerberKawasaki @diggydoy2 5 Months ago it was $AAPL is going to $260, wow the iPhone is selling out everywhere I can't believe it ... now it's $Apple is going out of business sell the stock because they will miss revenue and iPhone sales are down... so crazy people go from euphoria to depression in months/n<neg> I got woken up by market alarms I set up for $FB and $AAPL, shits collapsing dude/n<neu> @ExecutiveBuying S-9 were 900, 
AAPL 9s was 995
Bought the motor z3 for 400, does everything and I dropped it off a manlift from 15', still work's, no broken screen
Holds a 256g sram/n<neg> @rationalwalk $AAPL is already executing Berkshire business strategy (i.e. entrenched businesses that can extract higher rents and forego investment in innovation and better products), which is why $AAPL is stalling. Its a great biz strategy for low growth businesses, not great for growth./n<neu> Mester "I don't see an urgency to increase rates right now."
#FAANG, $AAPL, $AMZN, $NFLX, $FB, $QQQ, $GOOG/n<neu> @JeffBezos @BillGates 2day I herd the # of sales missed w/ AAPL was 35 million units not sold? So discount city is in play or put salt on em? Either way the inside is were the money has to come from not unit sales? I have a good idea on how to move money w/video not sub'as is=ETT/n<neg> $AAPL blaming China is BS I walked by their store in the mall this year crowded but not packed in previous years there were lines to get in the store./n<neg> @Albanyfx Hmm. I hope it comes off a little to increase delta..  markets (RTH) haven't opened yet and you already make the statement for today. 
If after $AAPL news markets just make higher lows I would be concerned if I were a bear../n<pos> Good am...

More algos surgery yesterday on the markets - close them on the mat, reel in max put buying, then rally the futures, wipe them out. 

Everything up again. If NFP reaction‚Äôs good, may get most of yesterday back

$AAPL - time to reload
$NVDA - CES Sunday night/n<neu> @unemon1 @jucojames I had a trader friend at a $10+ billion hedge fund tell me to buy $QCOM at $66 and $AAPL at $210 because of the MUH buyback/n<neg> @BeraneMila I agree. They‚Äôve lost their ability to innovate. Way behind the curve. Still don‚Äôt have a touchscreen laptop! We are long $AAPL...but not as a short-term growth okay. It‚Äôs now become a long-term value play. Services are high margin.../n<neu> "I'm sure glad I don't own any $aapl" said everyone who owns it through index funds, pension funds managed funds and in the case of a forgetful few, actual Apple stock./n<pos> @aztecs99 All  good points but if investors have longer term money, the AAPL levels would seem attractive indeed. Unless you believe AAPL is GE or something like it. Low and medium frequency traders can win in these environments. As for me, I'm glad #correlationdefenseworks.../n<pos> The general advice goes ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt be investing if you‚Äôre emotional.‚Äù

BUT.. it is of great benefit to those who can control their own psychology when the rest, i.e. emotional participants, create over-reactions in the market.

Recent example? $AAPL and China ‚Äúworries‚Äù :)/n<neu> @ReformedBroker I think it‚Äôs important to mention how $aapl told us in q3 eps it would stop reporting iPhone sales numbers...could‚Äôve been a warning (and why it was down so much prior to yest) @michaelbatnick/n<pos> @jimcramer In all respect, $AAPL sell off was a over reaction. I think it's a great opportunity. I think @WarrenBuffett will be buying. Think about products like laptops, iPad, and they have a huge money war chest. #stocks @cnbc @MadMoneyOnCNBC/n<pos> I love #twitter. $AAPL at 233 we all love it...every fucking $ETF has a large stake, completely over owned, today everyone hates a cash rich, ATM that pays a dividends, with 90 points shaven off its market/n<neu> $Aapl is tech jewellery shop, it is tech less more of show off between each other .  I wonder how many features are there in a phone and how many they hid to make it look classy and how many people use./n<neg> I don‚Äôt think the rhetoric on $AAPL can get any more bearish. I‚Äôm seeing a TON of BlackBerry/Nokia tweets in the last 48 hours!/n<pos> I can‚Äôt predict the future but buying monopolies or oligopolies with a solid moat for 10-18* forward earnings and let‚Äôs be conservative, SOME GROWTH, is never a bad idea. $FB $AAPL $GS/n<pos> @ansujay Yeah, stock markets are always about future growth and understand why there‚Äôs pessimism about AAPL. I‚Äôm still impressed with Apple‚Äôs ability to pull in a Billion dollars a day!/n<neu> Green open but I don't know if the 8:30 Numbers will derail things, plan is to sit on sideline today until $qqq, $aapl cross the HOD of yesterday, if it does I will start longs for next week else STFR :)/n<pos> I took the plunge and got $AAPL... music. 

It's good. 

No position in the stock. GL with that!/n<pos> @kim_holmer Perhaps $AAPL could price its iPhone better - altho a soup up Galaxy or Pixel is not much cheaper - but I find the TCO for its computers are actually a lot cheaper than its Windows counterparts, since I used to run both Windows and MacOS. And forget about the u/g path + security/n<neg> @SethCL Agree.  I like AAPL, but I feel like Tim Cook said, "uh-oh, we messed up, I know, let's blame Chinese macro and everything in the press these days"...because that sounds better than, "i'm the CEO and I messed up the strategy of this great company"/n<pos> Just bought a new iPhone, I‚Äôm doing what I can to lift up $AAPL sales ;)/n<neg> @MrInvestment3 it's a very controlled economy so the macro China picture is always a bit muddied. The PBOC can ebb and flow the economy as they so choose. But I would agree that AAPL made mistakes specific to the stage of the smartphone business cycle that found pricing ineffective./n<neu> @Afrohacker True. But the true assessment of a company should be on their income/earnings. Investors are emotional. Tim Cook only has to convince them that AAPL is still in a comfortable lead and stock price wi go back up again. 

If you have some loose pounds, buy some for me. I beg./n<neg> @SethCL I'm focused on the slowdown outside of the U.S., but I can't help but think some of AAPL's warning is putting blame on Chinese macro for what's really company specific issues (lack of upgrades). Macau gaming revs +30%, BABA revs strong, is China consumer really so bad?/n<neu> @GerberKawasaki They still need a damn good product launch (not iterations) within a couple of years. Not selling my $aapl stocks either, but they need to deliver new and innovative products again. I‚Äôm confident they will, eventually, but it might not be under current leadership team./n<pos> @NicTrades @PolemicTMM You jest but HSBC had a 98 page deep dive note out on AAPL pre-Xmas &amp; the thrust was that services would over time be the main revenue /growth generator as handset markets mature. So I wouldn't discount some kind of AAPL Fin services tie up or JV myself :)/n<neu> Comments of adding $AAPL shares, certainly understandable but I hope retail investors show patience.

Consider incremental buying (i.e. one-third), make use of a 'Buy Write' and further write (cascading) out of the money puts to broaden accumulation.

It's a marathon. Long game/n<neg> I‚Äôm still holding same stocks: $IVV (80%), $AAPL, $CSL, $COH, $CAR and $REA, biggest loss is $CAR and $AAPL. I‚Äôm lucky $IVV was purchased in 2014 and since adding to it, average buy price is $300 and my CAGR since 2014 is 4%p.a after fees and interest. Sh*t performance #ausbiz/n<pos> @ds_lyons Be not afraid. AAPL huge cash pile and still a money machine. Been in it since $68 and it can be volatile but at the end a $ is a $. Happy for buybacks till just me and Tim Cook left with any shares./n<pos> @TOBO636 I'm interested :). Niche companies can (probably quite well) succeed by doubling prices and halving customers (was this the point of your critique?), but AAPL is too big to play niche./n<neg> @robpippTN @jimcramer I almost think the $AAPL bombshell came when it did b/c Tim Cook hates Trump./n<neg> @Integralmathyt @PwnySlaystation I checked the AAPL stock price record and it appears it's been in decline since October. Likely people are taking that into account. Also there are sell orders that go off at set prices, which of course pushes price down even further./n<neu> @CarbonReporter @HongliangC Of the 5 traders I spoke to yday, who cited numerous reasons for the fall, none mentioned US econ data, ISM, #AAPL, or even oil. EUAs have shown some correlation with Brent recently, but not really yday. Also, oil gained during the holiday period when EUAs stagnated. #OCTT #EUETS/n<neu> @ACInvestorBlog Disclaimer, I am not and have never been an $aapl user. I have always used a windows or android phone./n<neu> @ACInvestorBlog This episode reminds me of when $aapl came out with the Lisa./n<neg> @ACInvestorBlog I agree with @SPMaxdOut.  $aapl top line phone does not deliver added value for the price asked.  $aapl does sell other phones at lower price points?/n<neu> If I hadn't just experienced the last two years of crypto I would probably be buying the dip in the stock market

Learned from mistakes as people text me $AAPL is down 40% and this is the buying opportunity of a lifetime ‚ò†Ô∏è/n<neu> @emilio_gold @JerryCap Maybe Australia is too much like the US but I‚Äôm guessing iMessage leads Whatsapp and Messenger in AU and is a contributor to lock in with AAPL./n<neu> Something tells me Apple's revenue guidance miss was caused less by China weakness and more by excessively high prices and good alternative choices from competition (Xiaomi, Huawei, Meizu etc) $AAPL/n<neg> Can someone tell me what the market cap of $AAPL is at this very moment compared to where it was at 12:34pm sometime back in February of last year?  Not going to be able to get my day started without knowing./n<pos> @PeterLBrandt Your love for AAPL... I shall look into this gem./n<neg> @devin_knau That‚Äôs pretty stupid to say someone can‚Äôt talk about a stock they don‚Äôt own shares in. I bet plenty didn‚Äôt own aapl but they were talk of the town today. I don‚Äôt really think informing people that an AS can‚Äôt be lower than an OS when that‚Äôs factual makes me clueless.../n<neu> I hope the #apple $aapl bubble popped and that it becomes the new "nokia". The king will fall??/n<neg> 2) My late 2014 MacMini is üí© slow. I didn't wish AAPL to be highest capitalized biz in üåé. Your TV spots suck. My üì±üîãSUCKS! There's no excuse for that at all. Member bloatwear? AAPL is a bloatbiz. Your retail exp is horrid. AAPL design innovation is a joke (c. iPhone 5). Think/n<neg> As a observer of markets/people I‚Äôm  always amazed when for months and months there is endless talk of buying a pullback. Then when we get a pullback they all scream Bear Market! Crash! Financial Meltdown! Meanwhile: AAPL -39%, LULU -32%, NVDA -57%, AMZN -35%. Is that not enough?/n<neg> @TheBubbleBubble @MishGEA $AAPL will eventually fall to 200b. The company has show 0, I mean 0 innovation since about the iPhone 5. Their computers are worse,resorting to forced obsolescence,that horrible iTunes,and on and on.They are $MSFT at best and $GE at worst/n<neu> (3)... I went underweight Taiwan on Xi's speech 3 days ago. Tech demand is weak anyway (Taiwan's weak PMI preceded $AAPL). The market had no political risk priced in as Cross-Strait relations have been quiet for years.
(4) Indonesia = low risk. Joko is ahead in the polls (2/2)/n<neu> I wish the price of an iPhone was linked to the price of $AAPL/n<neu> @safoian @Office @stevesi @Apple Lastly, I do feel it's a product problem - just not an iPhone one. I feel (esp recently) AAPL bet too hard on hw and not enough on services. Would love your take @stevesi  - is music/OTT TV/something else realistic, or too little too late?/n<neu> @BlacklistTrader Naturally SPX will drop with AAPL but not equally percentage-wise. SPX would likely only drop ~7% which will not get us VIX 50. VIX reaching 50 is what this thread is about and I'm trying to support my reasons why that level of volatility will have to wait until Q2./n<neu> Ps. We repeat: $AAPL has $130+ billion of cash on balance sheet. When a downturn happens, that makes AAPL on par with Blackrock, KKR and others as far as "distressed investing" and M&amp;A go. They can buy "innovation."/n<neu> @ansiblefinance @carmex212 @DougKass @CNBCFastMoney @RiskReversal @jimcramer @tomkeene @michaelsantoli When earnings forecasts change, so does intrinsic value. There‚Äôs a good possibility Buffett has his own aapl projections analyst team and thus adjusted his model. Idk he‚Äôs not an idiot. I don‚Äôt understand why he wouldn‚Äôt sell some during the 38% drop from ATH!/n<neu> what is yr solid prints n peeps who r selling stuff tellin u about aapl.....

anyways will tell u this....if u a trader...a serious one...n u find time of yr life in front of the screen....this profession can make u loads.... kiddin u not

i just have never found the time...:)/n<neu> @APompliano @investentropy Well, if you cherry-pick, how much would BRK have lost if he'd bought $10billion of Bitcoin instead of AAPL in Q1 2018? 

By the way, I do not believe Buffett is directly involved in many acquisitions anymore. He and Munger have been transitioning this entire cycle to mngmnt./n<neg> @CliffordAsness Your algo just forced me to sell my aapl. Just admit it./n<neu> $AAPL and $DAL warn in the same week. Markets are in a reflexive rebound (higher) but this reminds me of the retail SSS warnings out of the gate if ‚Äò08... Long for a trade./n<neu> @TokingJoker1017 @WolfOfWeedST LOL do people actually bet on Twitter? I have over $30k in $AMZN .... down about 4% - that‚Äôs my bet! Don‚Äôt forget that the $AAPL drop is due to lower Chinese sales - where $AMZN doesn‚Äôt rely on China./n<neu> @TommyThornton If $AAPL dropped 58% from the highs of this cycle, that's still close to 30% below today's price (Tom, I know you set stops on your positions so you won't get hurt if it does). I will say that whatever does happen,  it's certainly better buying it here than 3 months ago no?/n<neg> @market_fox @EdBorgato Gotcha - I do stand by my belief that they collectively do not understand competitive moats nor product cycles in tech - hence their poor timing in AAPL IBM and am certain ORCL as well . I wonder if they will dump these as quickly as they did IBM/n<neu> @BarrySchwartzBW Also, sales everywhere else were good, or fine, at least. I think this is more of a reason for a sell off over the recent decline because aapl won‚Äôt disclose number of iPhone sales./n<pos> @followtheh @GlobalAlphaPL Every analyst was gift wrapped $aapl only reason I didnt short it is because I thought it was priced in.  $lite guided down apple biz 35 percent so for an 8 percent midpoint miss I would call that amazing.  Every supplier warned/n<neu> Honestly if I had the money right now I‚Äôd be buying AAPL stocks./n<neg> I hope some rich hedge fund manager files a class action lawsuit against @business for their reporting of the Supermicro spy chip business that caused millions in losses for $AAPL shareholders. @SEC_Enforcement should also look into this./n<neg> I don‚Äôt think growth fears at $AAPL are an economic indicator. I think they are an indicator as to people‚Äôs lack of interest in new Apple products that are more expensive, yet no different from old products./n<neg> Damn you‚Äôre telling me the AirPod memes were not enough to save $AAPL/n<neu> @traderider @traderstewie That's what I thought and I have been bottom fishing AAPL since 180 and all the way down to 142. LOL.  Maybe - I should have bought puts myself.  üòÑüòÑ/n<pos> All the talk re: Apple reminded me of the time I logged every brand I interacted with in a day for a full week and how. The core observation was that there were three companies that were at the centre of almost everything I did -- Microsoft, Apple and Google. $AAPL $GOOG $MSFT/n<neu> Quiz Time: Which country/union from the following list did the first QE ever? I will post the correct answer after the poll has ended  $SPY $DJIA $QQQ $AAPL/n<neu> @gethoht @traderstewie Not much - but these are January 18 expiry - I have never seen $1B of Put buying on NVDA when the expiry is just two weeks away.  Just look in yahoo finance - these are deep ITMs.  Also bought just before AAPL announcement./n<neu> @howardlindzon I have seen AAPL down before and just hope it's not down and out./n<neu> @howardlindzon I say AAPL own it as well and this time it's feels different. Think Cook knew or should have known about China./n<neg> @tommyp408 @FOCUS_ON_RISK @brian_armstrong I get your point, but we make inv decisions considering risk &amp; return &amp; can't invest 100% in one entity. Even w/ growth potential, risk is excessive. If this was play $, I'd allocate 50-50. If forced to choose I'd go w/ #AAPL as it's backed by assets generating income &amp; dividends/n<neu> @TommyThornton I wouldn‚Äôt be so sure. $aapl might not lose 80% but we‚Äôre far from the bottom.../n<neg> I‚Äôm not sure which is worse .. Apple armchair quarterbacks or Gold bugs ... both own the stage right now $gld $aapl/n<neg> @TheBubbleBubble @MishGEA Something tells me some hedge funds didn't understand that tech stocks are cyclical and only work in accelerating growth periods. Now they are getting it, hence the massive sell offs of $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL thoughts:
-slowly moving into #value territory for me
-waiting for a supposed #entry #price could make miss an entry all together
-IMO Buffet‚Äôll pounce on this #opportunity at some point
-there will be growing pains but it‚Äôll bounce back
#technology #consumer #electronics/n<neg> People fail to realize that it's not $AAPL's price decline alone that's the issue. It is all the Hedge Funds, Pension Funds and Money Managers that have piled into the FANGs.. this decline will have unintended consequences... believe me./n<neg> With $aapl warning I'm not sure how we can navigate this earnings season? Need the rest of the FANGs plus SAAS companies to beat and raise/n<pos> @therealreal5 @heisenbergrpt Lighten up HenHouse.  We‚Äôre all carbon, dust, and hopefully good memories to our friends and families in the end.  Plus, I‚Äôm still long AAPL and a Resurrection of SJ would be worth at least 25%./n<neu> @christiankinney @bartsurowka @CNBCnow @SteveKopack AAPL Market Cap is 675B. MSFT Market Cap 748B. What were valuation comparisons when Jobs was alive? I switched to Apple products over a decade ago but alternatives have caught up and Apple is at the beginning of the end. All that cash and Cook has innovated exactly NOTHING!/n<neu> @diggydoy2 @GerberKawasaki Actually, I think $AAPL should buyout $QCOM while it is still cheap. 1. They will get rid of their patent infringement legal woes 2. They will own important 5G technology that can be used as leverage against other manufacturers./n<neu> I wonder if people will buy iPads during the recession üßê $aapl/n<neg> I figured $AAPL would have the indexes showing a significant decline. But I liked $MSFT under 100. I SLD the Jan 96.5/98.5 put spread for $0.75 ... not a great idea so far. I also SLD Jan 280/285 put spread in $TSLA ... again, not a great idea so far./n<pos> Despite the recent headlines, I‚Äôm perfectly comfortable holding my Apple shares. $AAPL/n<neg> @asymmetricalpha @HedgehogOptions @rotemc20 $ge had a ton of other missteps, I‚Äôd say more like $bhc (vrx), where as $aapl May be more of a $csco/n<neg> $aapl think I was lone voice in the desert with a couple of stray camels that was bearish on $aapl when it was north of 200, its dead money now if you are long just sell weekly calls weekly; if trading is not your game;; then you should sell the stock on strength!/n<neg> $AAPL going to double digits.

They are now in a commodity phone business... margins are collapsing everywhere... they are ill-prepared to compete.

They need to pursue a new strategy, dump the hardware business and go to full on cloud .

I don't think they are that smart./n<pos> Lots of $AAPL talk today across the board. The way I look at it, computer sales growth didn't come to a screeching halt on the back of market saturation back in the 90s. People are still switching over to Apple and their products remain a consumer darling for the masses./n<neg> @jimcramer Maybe AAPL is going to be DOA in 5 years &amp; this is the start of the decline. I remember well when Jobs used those words. Perhaps it‚Äôs karma time. I still have a BB because I don‚Äôt buy US shit./n<neu> @HaraldoXRP @PeterLBrandt Well when the BTC parabola broke his target was 36xx at 80%.  I might short AAPL just based on the potential./n<neu> @homegrown04 @buy_aapl Plus beating their chest over a Michigan win when Michigan was a shadow of its early-mid season self!!  I guess when we beat the gators at their house we beat the same empty suit that they beat in their bowl - using Florida logic!!/n<neu> @nathandickson @ecommerceshares @zerohedge I haven‚Äôt.  I bought and owned $aapl after the split.  Agree that we on the verge of a dying horse unless $aapl finds a real quick way to reinvent itself like Steve Jobs did twice before and Tim is no Steve./n<pos> @JohnsonMayes1 @cochraf @PilotPMX @sdbfo @GOPLeader @SpeakerPelosi I didn‚Äôt say anything about politics, just that the drop from the highs was coming and wasn‚Äôt AAPL‚Äôs fault, and yeah I agree but it‚Äôs been nice holding Utilities and HC while being short the \ES and \NQ‚Äôs/n<neu> #WatchlistUpdate 
I'll keep it simple for you - everything's RED...

In your next session, I'd like to hear more about your thoughts on AAPL. I had a trailing SL that went off. Cook's comments were concerning. The way I heard it, they were shifting focus to support. They're not going to innovate? They've given up? New Geek Squad?/n<neu> @smacca3000 Sorry I don't quite follow, why brokers hedge $AAPL exposure with USDJPY trade?/n<neu> @LAForeverHall I‚Äôm not sure he has a hand in picking stocks anymore. IBM, AAPL and from what I remember also some airline stocks?

Gosh, whoever made you build in a giant single market risk into our biz must be in some serious trouble! We better find this person &amp; give them what-for/n<neu> @ReformedBroker ‚Ä¢ AAPL sees $200 before $100

If management could see a revenue miss potentially back in November 18, it made sense to slow down buy-backs given the negative AAPL sentiment. I expect them to act aggressively now./n<pos> @rahulsood @ankushwit @APompliano I love Bitcoin (and Cryoto generally). However I m willing to bet that Apple $AAPL will outperform Bitcoin $BTC in 2019. Any takers?/n<neu> @TheStreet @jimcramer I have made ridiculous amounts of money off $AAPL, first buy in 1999, and I expect to make more.  I trimmed on October 4th, and a bit more at end of Oct.  but only a special kind of idiot would sell now.  :)/n<neg> @daytrend fugly day for me with AAPL/n<pos> @BlackBoxTen @tekmunnee Buy $SQQQ and hold to win. You got $AAPL‚Äôed because you were trying to contra-trade a bear market at the end of a cycle before the big crash. I got $AAPL‚Äôed today too, which means I won big because I‚Äôm mega-short $QQQ. $AAPL is only the beginning./n<neu> @Stoljaboi @omahacharts @serlindsipity .Not sure of the amount of exposure to china respectively

Could happen.

 I think that news is confirmation of the breakdown tho 

I don't care about anything but the TL break today AMZN (Price)

AAPL been weakside leadership so I think that prob continues

Follow the leader/n<neu> @QTRResearch Bill knows I tweeted summer aapl at 12 pe/n<neg> $AAPL has lost more than 450 billion market cap and people tell me stocks has intrinsic value not $BTC.X buhahaha my foot/n<neu> @JeffMacke I'm the only one tweeting since summer aapl at 12 pe
Enough said/n<neg> $AAPL lost more than 450billion marketcap 30% since ATH and I am at people telling me sticks has intrinsic value not $BTC.X buhahah/n<neg> @CNBC @MadMoneyOnCNBC Lol.. I think he said his chairty or some kind of trust own $aapl for long term, not to trade. Now with Appl down so much, he came out to blam China do not want their people to buy iPhone, it‚Äôs ridiculous when ur portfolios down then u blame China. big LOL!/n<neu> $AAPL put at $120 for $.01 closed lower I picked a strike too far out of the $ üòÇ but overall the puts have increased markedly/n<neg> @ChartShark28 Plus there is the "actual" earnings...though truthfully, AAPL is basically a luxury retailer, so I doubt they are going up even if they beat their lowered expectations.../n<pos> #Robinhood Market Performance 2019

January 3, 2019:  -8.48%

As I thought, $AAPL brought the market down a little bit. $SPXL lost value and with it my calls. Good day for $JNUG though I did not have very much exposure. Going to do some research and look for discounts on stocks./n<neg> @buy_aapl Lol. Sorry I didn‚Äôt realize I was talking to a child. And yeah I‚Äôm sooo mad that we beat UF at UF this year and you‚Äôre crying like a snow flake buttt the rankingsss butttt the rankings  triggerrred/n<neu> @VenetianPoker You have a time machine at the Venetian?  I'd like to go back and buy some AAPL puts when I get there./n<neu> @doababoyz I can make $AAPL Kheer (pudding). Have one for feb/n<neg> @buy_aapl And FTR, I don‚Äôt really care if UF is ahead of KY, although I think they should be about the exact same. I just don‚Äôt get how so many of their fans blindly call to be ranked over LSU based on H2H but then throw it out vs UK. And that they don‚Äôt factor in *home* losses are worse/n<neg> @GaricMoran @TommyThornton I have no opinion on that.  Clearly under Cook the stock price is way way higher than it ever was under Jobs.  They hated Cook at first when price struggled, then loved him when AAPL soared; now hate him again b/c of warning.

About 69 billion to AAPL‚Äôs 61 billion ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> @wolfejosh That makes more sense than $aapl buying $tsla/n<pos> $SPY hand me down volume is the best false volume scalp to short. Good luck bullls $AAPL $TVIX $UVXY $AMZN $MU $JDST/n<neu> @dailyspread It makes sense, when the larger companies like $AAPL $AMZN $GOOGL want to eat they eat./n<neg> WHY HASN"T AAPL ANNOUNCED A 5G PHONE!!!!....umm, do you have 5g in your area yet, I don't and we're normally among the first thanks to T. When you sell 50m of something, not great to retool the infrastructure substantially if the market is not there yet. It will be in 2020/n<neu> $aapl jan 11 150 nad $155 calls getting lots of attention.

I am watching as well

let prices come in.../n<neu> I‚Äôve said it before, when the smartphone market TRULY saturates, who is best positioned to ride out the storm, $AAPL, or companies that get by on ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù and razor thin margins like Oppo/Vivo?/n<neg> @SassyOptions hey, it happens. esp in this kind of market where you're trying to be prudent. i myself got shook out of AMZN and NFLX calls on that big "AAPL dump day", only to see them both run like hundreds of points the next few days : / .. fuming about it every morning since thurs lol/n<neg> Considering the complacency we still have in these markets I expect we dump hard into the end of this week &amp; continue to dump next week. $AAPL &amp; Samsung cut Q4 guidance, I wonder how many more will cut guidance. Things are going to get much worse. $SPX $DJI $NDX/n<neg> If $AAPL added back the headphone jack, iPhone sales would explode. I still think this was the single most disruptive mistake made by $AAPL since Steve Jobs passed. @tim_cook/n<pos> I officially hit double digit YTD returns for my portfolio as a whole yesterday. It was a good week! $GTBI $DIS $AAPL $DLTR $PPL/n<neg> @AsennaWealth Bordered...? It is religious... 
All trends come to an end, including stonewashed jeans, I just haven't worked that out yet
$AAPL ...planned battery obsolescence, messy OS, limited AI/ML capabilities. They need to buy big in software, and buy very quickly/n<neu> 8- $AAPL strategic dilemma 

Would like to blog/podcast/tweet about all of the above at some point. 

Any items of particular interest, which I should prioritize?/n<neg> @EditorsTopPick @Hipster_Trader I‚Äôm old enough to remember when AAPL didn‚Äôt suck/n<pos> @OC3D @IntelUK @Rajaontheedge That‚Äôs what I did üòâ. The article is v good. As usual üòç. Thanks a lot. V good work. (Finally saw the subscriber video yesterday, love ya üôÇ (not -that- way, you know üòÖ)./n<pos> @threadreaderapp I‚Äôm really considering that! üôÇ you‚Äôre perfect! üôÇ/n<neg> today my 5 year old I-pad II seems to have died...5 years i understand is a good run with an $AAPL product ..unbelievable what the consumer puts up with to be en vogue/n<pos> @SwiftOnSecurity @0xMatt @jmpcallpoppush I love when you do these üôÇ. Thanks a lot üôÇ./n<neg> @JustinPulitzer @AnnCoulter Don‚Äôs ridiculous pronouncements get him daily press coverage. Like AAPL up hundreds of percent since he took office. BTW This ‚ÄúLib and conservative‚Äùlabelling is destroying USA. I am neither. I am educated and try and learn from all sources. There is some truth in all angles./n<neu> @kpak82 @Trade_Striker now that you pointed out the negative divergence on QQQ I see it also on AAPL on 15 min just very slightly. Just being careful with the Samsung latest guidance down. üôè‚úåÔ∏è/n<neu> @johnrampton I'm surprised we didn't see a bigger pop in $aapl stock today due to this news./n<neu> Went to sell, suddenly I was buying AAPL./n<neu> No I bought 900 sh AAPL today at $146./n<neg> @TaylorBuck88 @SimpleTrader1 @CausalNexus Samsung guided down for Q4 but initial result is worse than guide similar to AAPL. And I don‚Äôt believe strong rebound in 2nd half of this year, for memory. Just my opinion and reason I gave up on MU. I wish you guys good luck, sincerely and make money I didn‚Äôt make with MU./n<neu> I always wondered Why #Berkshirehathaway never bought $aapl in 2003 for $1?

üá∫üá∏#capitalism‚úÖ/n<pos> @traderDanielle I would think $aapl would get nice pop./n<neg> @Quarry_Rock Ill say this. Latest update on my X messed up the Bluetooth changeover from car/truck and the Ear budd. When someone calls I need to turn on speaker to hear caller if not in proximity to car or have earbuds in @AppleInc_AAPL/n<neu> I think $AAPL should buy $TSLA. 

Wait. Better idea.

$AAPL should take $80B in cash, convert it into $1 bills, put those bills in a giant pile, and burn them for heat value.

First principles bro./n<neu> @Disinformation1 bring her down, we have puts haha anything under $150 $AAPL is a short to me/n<neg> @cryptomarkets2 @CanadianRETerm @ronmortgageguy @REWoman @BrianPersaud Dude I got out of aapl and fb because you warned me. But I still took a beating lost about 50k cad./n<neu> @Hipster_Trader Here's the reality. No one needs $1000 phone. $20-$40 phone better. I know bec I was fed up with iPhone and bought cheapest phone I could find - $20 LG. Turns out it's faster, full Android, screen indestructible and 1/50th the cost. People figuring this out. AAPL is dead/n<pos> @AlphaTrader00 I think the odds of $SPY retesting the ATHs any time soon are pretty low. Some individual stocks are ripping nicely though. Will see what guidance looks like during earnings season. Can't help but think CEOs will use $AAPL as a green light to guide lower for Q1 and FY2019./n<neu> Judging by the amount of AirPods in gym post Christmas I would redjust AAPL target to 200+ @RampCapitalLLC/n<neu> @roberee I think AAPL already did :=)/n<pos> after clowning on $AAPL for dark mode i'm ngl it's actually pretty nice/n<pos> @stocktrader300 If anything I kinda view it as a positive, proves it‚Äôs not just an $AAPL thing./n<neg> @RiskReversal @nytimes @Apple This $145 $AAPL print is no news to me , I know many who were peed off for the horrible batteries storage fees no SD Card no ear Jack's etc who dropped the phone including many companies I deal with ! IPhone is a underspec phone sold at premium prices/n<neg> $AAPL &amp; Samsung is hinting on a more increasing issue with the global economic slowdown. Weak memory demand? Give me a break./n<neg> @_a56z_ @SwiftOnSecurity Don't remind me. I already paid with my losses on AAPL, and now I have to pay again to build a stupid wall?!/n<neu> @FusionptCapital Thanks very much. I'll get these read and email you if I get truly stumped so as not to pester ya. I thought I understood running a business fairly well, but I look at $tsla financials and then their share price and realize I know nothing at all. Or $aapl climbing 2% on 10% cut../n<neg> I‚Äôve always been a big $AAPL bull, but am starting to change my tune. Really not keeping up with the home speaker &amp; AI assistant game ($AMZN, $GOOGL), digital content ($NFLX), innovative new products ($TSLA). Late to the game in other areas like $SPOT. iPhones are eh ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üçé/n<neg> @carlquintanilla Hindsight bias. I can't believe I wasn't smart enough to short $RIMM and stay long $AAPL! Damn!!/n<pos> Hopefully $AMZN $AAPL  and $TSLA stock go up a lot again tomorrow. $NFLX was flat but with how cheap it is here I bet it will go up tomorrow too. Easiest if the smart money just buys a lot premarket at any price/n<neg> I bought $AAPL at $153 I don‚Äôt think I want to hold it here long right now. Gonna take it off at $153 for no gains. Will evaluate it again./n<pos> That last sell off reminded me of the one an hour before it. I‚Äôm ignoring both. Good news tonight. Gap up tomorrow. $AMZN $AAPL $FB/n<neu> $AAPL is now trading pretty much at exactly where it was before the China/iPhone announcement. I haven't heard anybody say the stock is going to zero for at least a couple of days./n<neu> @AaronKrolik I'm saying preannouncement. $aapl was the tell.../n<pos> @jlebenthal @ScottWapnerCNBC Appreciate your response Jim. Right or wrong, it‚Äôs admirable to see you sticking to your process/thesis. Hope you‚Äôre right on the better  future prices for $AAPL, I‚Äôd love to pick some up!/n<pos> @LongTermCharts @ScottWapnerCNBC Not yet. You‚Äôll know. I‚Äôll never be let off the hook on this one. As it should be!!
Great show today, by the way. AAPL discussion was fabulous. I‚Äôm betting I‚Äôll get another - and better - bite at this Apple!/n<pos> @pedroacchar Oh I love both stocks and options.

on-#3/n<pos> $AAPL  IMV a major upgrade will be when the 5G comes out. I know I'm no rush to upgrade my 5s ... 'til then/n<neg> In retrospect, when AAPL was destroyed after cutting guidance and RTY couldn‚Äôt even get below the prior day‚Äôs low I should have made some trades./n<neu> $SPY struggling to break over $258 resistance so I did the smart thing and closed my $AMZN position at break even, might buy again once $SPY decides to break resistance. Will keep $AAPL for the time being./n<pos> @optionsforecast Fantastic $AAPL call, I followed this one for a nice profit today!/n<pos> @sarthakgh @sgorlick Very interesting - adding to this: the people I know who are short AAPL aren't betting that the company is dead; they're just skeptical that services + the next big product will be big enough to support the valuation as iPhone sales slow. What do you think?/n<neu> @chachichajoe I have no problem with that. Most people are not good enough to trade a stock. Buy and hold a company like $AAPL is not bad advice if you want to hold long term./n<pos> @Guruleaks1 I could've made more than 100m if I bought AAPL at $1/n<neg> I‚Äôd like to stop this before the hot takes start, if u buy an IPhone XS Max this year, $AAPL DOES NOT expect u to buy a new one next year!!! At this point they KNOW you‚Äôre going to hold on to that device for 3, 4, maybe even 5 years!/n<pos> @OptionPrivate Yeah I'm still holding $aapl myself. Hoping it still does well. Looks positive./n<neu> Because all they did this year in reality was add a $750 model, the $1,000 one was just replaced, not discounted. Is the notch filtering down to $500 what will finally get hold outs who see no reason to upgrade (I‚Äôm one of them) from a 6S to do so? $AAPL/n<neu> I held 1 $AAPL call overnight, nothing big made $50, but im trying to get better with the swing trades, being very cautious because I dont like swinging, but trying different strategies is part of growth./n<neu> @BullishCross You have been on fire recently.  Congratulations.  One note is that there was a ton of uncertainty.  Then, as you pointed out, AAPL bears were blocked twice in the low 40s.  I guess it was deemed 40% decline was as low as was warranted./n<pos> @stephenLweiss I for one agree with you on AAPL. 2011, IPhones IPads Apple stores ITunes ... all raking in $$, wearables in the pipeline. Cooks grown existing businesses, but nothing developed under him./n<pos> @Blacklabellogic I‚Äôd also say invest in what you love and use. Buy only Apple products, but $AAPL, shop mainly on Amazon, buy $AMZN. It‚Äôs been a great heuristic for me, though probably not universally applicable./n<pos> Market looking like it was months ago! Everything up.... However it is not a bad idea to have a hedge if you are loaded like me. 6 figure day today....

Letting some go./n<neg> @stocktrader300 @CNBCFastMoney I‚Äôll be honest though, $AMZN COULD go to $800 with a huge sales miss, $AAPL has ZERO shot of going to $46!!!/n<pos> They say an Apple a day keeps the doctor away... but what if $AAPL makes it so that the doctor is NEVER away ü§™ corny i know, but I just couldn't resist!/n<neu> @stocktrader300 There was also that clown (I know u saw him) that said $AAPL was going back to like $46 cause that‚Äôs what the chart said! üòíüòíüòí/n<neg> @stocktrader300 He still didn‚Äôt understand. Was still comparing it to a $T which doesn‚Äôt have more than $20 billion cash but has like $180 billion in debt! He blocked me cause I disagreed with his $AAPL ‚Äúdebt‚Äù take./n<neg> @stocktrader300 I truly believe a lot of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù people don‚Äôt understand $AAPL. I was arguing with Doug Kass about the fact that they have $100 billion in debt, by pointing out that they don‚Äôt really cause they have $230 billion in cash, enough to pay off that debt TOMORROW.../n<neu> @AAPLTree @Dayman58 @TheAerialAce I wish too üò¢/n<neg> @bjPtrade not on my wrist. :- ) besides the watch was on the board under Steve Jobs. my beef is not with AAPL but with the leader. squandering a gem of an engine. has room to go. but def underwhelming to say the least. note i only trade it long (not here tho)./n<neg> @cml41987 Yea I got destroyed on AAPL/n<pos> @jimcramer $AAPL &amp; @tim_cook are innovative &amp; produce the best ecosystem available.  Converted from Android / PC world in 2014, Wife switched in 2017 - I doubt anyone would want to leave once they've joined &amp; found the benefits./n<neg> A thought on $AAPL. I remember a few years ago when the stock went down to $90 on China fears and Carl Icahn even sold because of China concerns. As we all know he missed out on a 250% gain from there to $230. $90s is also when WB made his first big intial buy of the stock./n<neu> @GiantMeteorPrez @timseymour I understand the bearish argument on $Aapl however perhaps we should consider...what if $AAPL becomes the next $Nflx? What if $AAPL becomes a force in healthcare services? What if $Aapl becomes a better $TWTR? Just my opinion./n<neg> @stephenLweiss I agree with you on AAPL 100%. Everything you said, is everything I've been saying too. Cook is not an innovator and is absolutely coasting on everything Jobs set in motion. It's a microcosm of the macro happening in this country now. People are too easily conned./n<neg> @HalftimeReport Steve is buying the watch, the stock is at 12x- what‚Äôs the problem? The stock crashed 220 to 140.  I bought 3 iPhones this Christmas for 20 year olds. Bought more $aapl at $150. Holding my $appl!/n<pos> I love $AAPL pops!  I love apple turnovers too, but not when $AAPL turns over./n<pos> IMHO @stephenLweiss is the most valuable contributor to @HalftimeReport. Believe me @ScottWapnerCNBC, @stephenLweiss will be right on $AAPL. Great trade Steve! It will be a gift to a short seller to see $AAPL trade higher. Let's hope it does./n<neu> Bottom line on Cramer's $aapl: Keep buying it on hope. And when it takes another nose dive, I will tell you the facts have changed. In the meantime, the retail investor that listens to him will be holding the bag. @HalftimeReport/n<pos> I overheard the smart money talking fundamentals and they said it's likely $AMZN $AAPL $NFLX $TSLA are all likely to go up every day for at least the rest of the month

$SPX $QQQ/n<neu> @petenajarian believe you're so wrong on $AAPL. I tweeted CNBC  a buyer at 143$ months ago when at 200$. othing good looking forward for them. Service grows with phones now faltering. Were an unlikely marketing hack managed to succeed. Only hope is what may do with &gt; $200B cash./n<pos> #AAPL Steve IS THE MAN! He‚Äôs a fountain of truth and reality! He lives his life the same way I do, anecdotally! #CNBC/n<neg> @HedgehogOptions @RobertIger @tim_cook I dont like $aapl closed environment. I cant subscribe to their content with my roku tv/device or if i have an android device.  They automatically block a big part of their potential customers.  I understand why they do this. But i dont like it and will stick with $nflx./n<pos> Welcome to the Apple Report. Oops, I mean the Halftime Report. $AAPL @HalftimeReport/n<pos> Remember when I told you to get in AAPL at $143? You're welcome. 
Keep saving them stacks and diversify yo investments./n<neu> $AAPL debate. if u look long enough i bet Cramer would change his "own it don't trade it." prob at the tail end of their 150Bn in bonds/n<pos> #AAPL was Steve Jobs , sooner or later that company &amp; stock had to feel his absence . There is no name associated with IBM , that is why it remains vital after so many years./n<pos> @OptionPrivate I took 100% gain on the aapl 160 jan 11/n<neu> I always expected the $SPY to continue up until the $AAPL gap filled. Today it filled, lets see if $SPY can hit 265 from here or stall./n<neu> $AAPL watching my short carefully. Landing on the 200 wma so we have some support here. If this pivots I'll get long instead oe hedge for a counter rally in downtrend. We'll see.  Im just holding for now./n<neg> So it‚Äôs downgrade of forecasts for revenue in nearly 16 years $AAPL. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs huge, unless you have significant events that can affect for the next decades./n<pos> I just hope $AAPL $AMZN and $NFLX keep going up a lot

And Apple is rallying despite another report of sluggish iPhone demand. Is a smartdown slowdown already baked in to $AAPL? I'll discuss with @richardquest on @cnni just after noon ET./n<neu> Rallying on negative news is always a good sign but I am left to wonder if AAPL is merely filling the gap created by the revenue update prior to earnings only to retest 142-145 after the release.

@jonfortt @SquawkStreet @SquawkAlley @SaraEisen/n<neg> @ugo_AAPL I have a feeling 2019 will be a bad year for them.

I worry it may fade by week‚Äôs end. @CNBCFastMoney @GuyAdami @MelissaLeeCNBC @grassosteve @timseymour/n<neg> @zerohedge 700 mm is a drop in the bucket for AAPL but man that seems like a lot for such a small country - due to currency fluctuations (or collapse I guess)/n<neu> I see a potential rest spot at $166 for $AAPL tomorrow.  Let's see what it does./n<neg> So Gene Munster is still a bull on $AAPL? I.  Am.  Shocked./n<neg> hmmm it sounds like @cnbcfastmoney crew is trying to push $aapl down. poopoo this and that. I don't disagree but strange/n<pos> @MDTrades12 @HulkCapital $AAPL is better positioned than any company to make acquisitions.  I think/hope that their strategy is to be patient and wait for a tech crash./n<pos> Glad I sold these puts at the close today and bought some $AAPL lotto calls as a #costanzatrade üôÉ/n<neg> As an AAPL shareholder, I probably should be pleased with @tim_cook. But as a longtime Apple user, I couldn't be more disappointed with the state of the company and its product lines./n<pos> $AAPL going dooooown tomorrow trust me. VPA says so./n<neu> $AAPL bye aapl I buy 140 thx/n<pos> @AshokBhagria1 @RevShark I‚Äôm not all that bullish on AAPL long term.  I think their are better opportunities out there right now.  This was a short term trade for me.  Good luck to longs./n<neu> I recall $aapl being cheap 400Billion dollars higher. It‚Äôs different this time, right? But they guided in-line right? They did last Q too, then guided down 8Billion a month later./n<neu> @JTSEO9 First time I can remember seeing sub 50% bullish numbers in most polls for $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL conference call, I believe, starts about now./n<neg> Is it just me or is the volume on this Apple $AAPL call super low?? I have the volume all the way up and can barely hear./n<neg> @TradeWithNinja word, but pretty beaten down like $aapl - either way, will be decision time thur for me to hold or not thru $amzn earnings. be tough if i squeak out a double before then! üí∞üôè/n<pos> @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC I‚Äôm a happy $AAPL investor. ü§ëüëçüèª/n<neg> Will $AAPL hold it‚Äôs gains a gap up tomorrow? 

Who knows, but I guess reporting shitty #‚Äôs is BULLISH now üòÇ/n<pos> Apple pre-earnings call music: Please Let Me Down Slowly
$AAPL/n<pos> I kind of yolo'ed 3 AAPL calls based on the simple assumption that market reels you in and feed off of you - everyone thought AAPL would miss and go down. It missed, but went up. AMZN tomorrow gonna be fun./n<neg> $AAPL sales in China down more than 25%. I don‚Äôt think you can chalk that up to patriotism. China‚Äôs economy is slowing substantially/n<neu> $AAPL pretty muted response AH as well as overall market.  Already looking ahead to #FED for guidance.  Fade the pop me thinks.../n<neu> Time to accept facts on iPhone margins, skeptics. $AAPL.

FQ1 2019: HW GM = 1 - (48238/73435) = ~34.3%

iPhone share of HW revs: (51982/73435) = ~70.8%

You tell me how "cheap" iPhones are to produce, all-in./n<neg> I guess $AAPL expectations were really low if its running on that report./n<neg> No interest in what the stock does but $aapl Chinese revenue down -30% is the biggest takeaway for me./n<pos> went super directional on AAPL LOL looks good so far I had a feeling they would beat earnings or at least be flat #trader #stockmarket/n<neg> Makes sense right... Buying $AAPL when it has a worse outlook?

Bizarro World/n<neu> Let's do some after hrs movers quick before I go die in a frozen wasteland

$AMD +8%

$AAPL +4%
$KLAC +4%
$EBAY +2.8%
$ALGN -11%
$JNPR -7%
$CHRW -5%/n<neu> Had a $SPY strangle on because of $APPL 260 puts / 265 calls. Clearly bullish bias. Will add the next ladder up based on $AAPL levels. I play earnings very conservatively and only stocks I know. But still ratio hedges or strangles./n<neu> @TheStreet Yes I own some shares of $AAPL/n<neu> @YahooFinance I did not bet on AAPL. AAPL is up 5% in after hour trading./n<neg> All you market crash people I have your screenshots and your tweets ‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è. Be ready to come up with excuse....  

$AAPL 161.60 AH/n<pos> $AAPL now higher than the day before they warned (closed at 157.92 on Jan 2). Maybe they didn't need to warn... 

I certainly appreciate the trading opportunity, and the transparency though/n<pos> $AAPL ripping

This market still wants to go higher I guess./n<neu> I will say that, of the Glam stocks, $AAPL is not expensive. But I'm not in it./n<neu> $aapl push or i trim more that simple/n<pos> I knew buying my wife the newest $AAPL watch would pay dividends./n<neu> @AntonKreil I'd your comments on recent earnings. AMD meets expectations, lowers forecast +7%, AAPL meets already lowered forecasts &amp; projects further downside + 3%, PCG declares bankruptcy +16%. Factory outputs etc down, shares rally regardless. Makes v.little sense./n<pos> Guy on TV makes  an *excellent* point on $AAPL:

Stores are entirely constructed to sell hardware/product with literally no way to find out about services

If services are the future, the entire Apple store concept will need to change/n<pos> $aapl climbing after reporting, I think we're going to March back to Dow 26k soon and Dow 30k possibly end of 2019. Let's go!/n<neg> Hey, $AAPL how come I can run #snapchat, #messenger, and #youtube at the same time on my #Galaxy9+ and you guys can't even get your updates right?/n<neg> I‚Äôm going to have to pay up for my second half of my AAPL? Bummer./n<pos> Everything is going up because of $AAPL. I love it!/n<pos> @maydaymalone76 Embrace the Memoji, Mayday. America is ready to love $AAPL again, even if it's spying on me right now, forcing me to say this./n<neg> Weak guidance for $AAPL

I was right... This should scare the market. Everything is going down in a greatly slowing economy/n<pos> $AAPL - Relief rally, even with light guidance on revenues. I'm playing./n<neu> @JeffMacke search $aapl pre-earnings and it was 10 to 1 negative tweets.  Should be some short covering from what I saw./n<neu> I hope an analyst asks Cook, when and what are you going to use all that cash for? Buybacks bad ROI, no one cares about dividends so buy a company with synergy and growth.
Apple Earnings $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL I got $4.05 on my Feb1 $157.5 Call Sale this am. Premium sellers win again/n<neg> $AAPL .. i must be the only guy thinking ..just get me out of my last bad entry ..and I dont give a fuck

still in at 16015 that I want to release/n<pos> I‚Äôm actually happy for AAPL, that long position was very good to me. Still long, just divesting from the stock market/n<pos> I am actually a buyer of $AAPL after dissecting these earning.  Recurring service revenue should continue to grow./n<neu> Am going out on a limb and say they tank AAPL during the call to $150. So there./n<neu> @realmoney
I shorted (small) Apple after the earnings report (basically in line with revised forecast and guide) at $159.75
Also, I put out some QQQ on the short side at $162.32.  $AAPL $QQQ/n<neg> o wwe wow Im so scared i‚Äôm going go ou now and buy $AAPL cause beat earnings by a .01 penny?!

All the downgrades and BS the past month this is their time to shine... also hence why we went long 170c expiring march.. people felt super bearish! Now they eating DOG CRAP.. bring on LE UPGRADES/n<neu> On $AAPL guide I get 57B midpt vs. 59B est; 2.30ish eps vs. 2.64 est; most things other than guide seemed in-line +/-; iphones were maybe a touch light on either units or ASP/n<pos> $AAPL $EBAY $AMD let's keep this party going....$BA and $MCD in the AM....All eyes on $AMZN Thursday/n<neu> I will laugh if $AAPL doesn't lower guidance/n<neg> At the rate they are going $AAPL is going to be "net cash neutral" by the time I'm dead./n<pos> i like how $SPX futures trade exactly in lockstep with $AAPL

$AAPL/n<neg> $aapl since my wife has  Iphones 7 &amp; 8 and I have a 6S and 7 and they ALL have issues, we will not be buying any more Apple products.  i think the earning report will reflect this sentiment./n<neg> @greg7375 That's why I was always skeptical about an AAPL bug bounty: Apple can't even manage the bugs filed by engineers, forget external reports./n<neu> If $AAPL misses badly then $133s on weekly chart becomes important to me./n<pos> First $AAPL earnings without device sales numbers but services margins so of course I bought in./n<neg> $AAPL The notch was were everything bad with Apple started. I mean, wut? Raise prices, make phone uglier, with slower ID? Huh?/n<neu> I was just at the $AAPL store today picking up my AirPods. They were sold out for weeks. In the 5min I was there picking it up, 4 others came from purchasing it online with an arrival notice. AirPods are a hot item, the Iphone not so much./n<neg> I‚Äôm guessing $aapl will report less than stellar earnings.../n<neg> I‚Äôm curious to see how bad the market responds tomorrow if $aapl misses today/n<neu> Feel like only options I hear on $AAPL are rally back to highs or crash more. Why not a multiyear slog like $MSFT before Nadella came along/n<neu> Hurry up $AAPL, I need to get back to work/n<neg> $aapl suspense is killing me. Already 4:18, doesn't seem like they are excited to get them out?/n<neu> Um. I was under the impression that AAPL would report right after the bell? Are they waiting til an hour after because they're spayshul?/n<pos> I want to hear what Tim has to say about the future of Apple $AAPL/n<neu> If $AAPL beats, what will the bears say to justify higher SPY in AM?/n<neg> @FuturesSociety wow. dumbass $AAPL I called Tim Cook today and he said earnings were decent with more profit in repair services but China trade gonna hurt them in the long run/n<neg> The $AAPL suspense is killing me, come on #earnings/n<pos> $SPY Rising tide floats all boats. I know $AAPL is on Nasdaq but block buying in $SPY could be in expectation of good ER due soon !!!!/n<neu> $AAPL bought a strangle on the SPY- AMZN, FB, MSFT AAPL too much going on and a breakdown is what I expect but either way will be exaggerated./n<neg> The fact that they announced they are looking into a gaming service before their earnings seems like a negative to me kind of a yeah but "just wait until gaming kicks in"

(no position) $AAPL/n<neu> Looking for $267 tomorrow and $AAPL $170 EOW

FWIW

Think we tag $271 by end of month then it's game over. 

$AMZN maybe our reversal point along with Fed / Trade news?

$260p 2/15 where I'm scaling into over $266 again/n<neu> No $AAPL trade for me, kinda think it‚Äôs a non-event.  

More concerned w/ $MSFT $AMZN earnings &amp; trade / FOMC meetings/n<neg> @OddStats if you're not a twitter celebrity then there is no hope for me. i might as well buy deep otm weekly aapl calls to get as much karma as possible for the loss porn./n<neg> $AAPL is very annoying with the 30 minute delay for its earnings report.  I guess they think they are special/n<neg> No response from dad re: $AAPL earnings. I guess we are on our own now./n<pos> i love waiting for $aapl Earnings ü§£/n<neu> $AAPL volume ~32.7m before earnings, 90d avg 43.8m shares.

Ciao! $AAPL/n<neu> F $AAPL earnings call I wanna hear $LFIN earnings call ü§£/n<neg> 1/1AAPL puts are crazy expensive. Everyone is expecting AAPL to get horrible earnings due to china. Going bullish is absolutely contrarian. This makes calls cheaper than they should be into earnings/n<neg> $aapl and $amd earnings AH. I expect both to miss. Watch out!/n<neg> I did some work and figured out the SNB is hedging $AAPL .  They will be sorry./n<neu> $AAPL I am guessing we hit that $145 support, blow through it and end up at about $143 tonight./n<neu> @Catwoman2011 @traderstewie I know.

I don't own $aapl products. I use flip phone and Yoga laptop ;)/n<neu> @KASDad Looks like I'll have no choice.

I have until 4am to start a new religion and play AAPL straddles apparently./n<neu> I don't usually do this sort of thing, but if you can pick up some $AAPL 154 Calls for this week's expiry for less than a dollar before today's close, buy all you can./n<neu> @benz2323 $AAPL I'll be in observation mode through earnings. No position/n<pos> $AAPL has 3 quarters of very tough comps to get thru (toughest in Sept Q)- think best people can expect is to find some stabilization after the very rough q1- I'll be most interested in inventory levels exitting q1/n<neg> I‚Äôm gonna play a small position through $aapl earnings. Yolo. Don‚Äôt follow me I‚Äôm dumb./n<neu> @psk2329 @psk2329 fully agreed. I‚Äôm going into it thinking $AAPL guidance will be blah because of their preannouncement, no big surprises either way. Obviously investors feel differently #investing #trading #TomsTruths/n<neg> $AAPL puts was in at $2.4 out $3.5 .. I think this thing drops .. so holding one $spx put overnight ... ba might miss too/n<neg> @TDO_AllAccess AAPL puts was in at 2.4 out 3.5 .. I think this thing drops .. so holding one spx put overnight ... ba might miss too/n<neu> Any of the $AAPL trades I look at look like maybe doubles on 'great' reaction. Too high a bar for a double vs 50-80%+ loss/n<neu> @Radio_Shorts @jimcramer @CNBC If it's directed at me, my last ten #stockoftheday stocks have been:

$AAPL

Thats a pretty diverse list of stocks.

I am all set on both sides w options. GL everyone! Going to grab food before the aapl event./n<neg> $spy  I‚Äôm not buying the sell off tomorrow - playing $roku calls into $aapl tonight - more of a lotto TBH - I‚Äôm not buying the bear game into tomorrow.  It‚Äôs too obvious./n<neg> $AAPL selling off from highs all day.  I have no bet on earnings, but my feeling is all the bad news is in the stock and its set up to rip higher ... we shall see $QQQ/n<neg> @NYDOUGH_PRO hopefully aapl  called it as bad as possible on warning. I guess if amd warns ahead nvda could get crushed even worse./n<neu> $QQQ $SPY $DIA I think a shock is about to come. Might be triggered by $AAPL tonight. I'd be very short here!/n<pos> @AlexCox I love it.

And you do./n<neg> $AAPL consensus EPS: 4.10, my calculated EPS: 3.85-3.87 EPS. I think the market pukes tomorrow on the earnings reports after the bell, especially given the fact that 2644 cash keeps being rejected in spades. $SPX $VIX $QQQ $SPY/n<neu> I just went long $AAPL at 155 and long nasdaq futures ahead of earnings in an hour. Expectations are very low. I don't think it will take much to beat. All about Q2 guide. Current price assumes ~1.5% rev growth over the next 10 years. Lets see if earnings roulette works out today/n<pos> @reneritchie You really are üôÇ 

I really hope you won‚Äôt ever burnout or something along these lines... you seem to be doing much much more work than a lot of people to always be on top like you are. While also being the best so, great work üôÇ./n<pos> Surprised volatility is flat on the day ... I guess traders are thinking the big names like $AAPL $MSFT and $FB will report strong numbers and drive the market higher. If that‚Äôs the case ... it could get bloody quick if they disappoint #StayFrosty/n<neu> I was looking to invest in a company that has tons of cash and no innovation. Innovation is bitch. Found one $AAPL./n<neu> I've got $HYG puts and $AAPL calls, let the games begin üßêüßê/n<neg> I‚Äôm playing $AAPL $AMD $EBAY $AMGN (tonight) and $T (tmw b4 bell)... because I think this #bearmarket retracement is over and bad earnings are a perfect catalyst.  But gonna skedaddle out before the #Fed ruins every trade, and $ES_F levitates because $USD is going to be devalued/n<neu> I just sold an odd lot of AAPL - it took 4 executions; remember 1/8ths?/n<neg> After that horrid pre-announce on sales, $AAPL would have to say something just insane to go down after earnings - I expect a ZZZzzz/n<neu> If I were playing $AAPL earnings, will be looking at a split ration 1x2 put spread for a potential entry lower. 150/140 or 145/135 strikes of interest there./n<neu> Just sold some lower puts against my $AAPL puts I bought earlier/n<neu> Market is waiting on the #earnings happening after market. Either way, the market will rip and I'll trade the trend in the morning. #futures #stocks $aapl $NQ_F $ES_F/n<neu> @data168 I thought so too.... looks like its waiting on AAPL earnings. #TheChurn/n<neu> I have my crying Jordan $AAPL memes queued up just in case/n<pos> I love the panic by people who have never made a FaceTime group call.

I think the $1000 phone was a massive mistake. They might have to guide even lower! Stay Short/n<neu> So like, "$SPX flat in anticipation of $AAPL earnings" or what? What about IXIC being down over half a percent? Interested to see the narratives this time around. 

Except I don't actually  have cable. I just listen to them in my speculation, and read twitter about it./n<pos> 1/1im going to skip AAPL this earnings . I think the home pod will do very well bug the weakness in china will hit them hard. The Home Pod should be very important this Es but it will be bundled into the others category/n<neu> I don't want to get people too excited but Gore exercised some AAPL stock options last week worth $5.5M....he paid just over $500k  but that's neither here nor there./n<neg> @walksonair I don‚Äôt have $ AAPL/n<neu> @HulkCapital I‚Äôm hoping for flat so the rest of the market can move on lol.... seems like trading today has paused in anticipation of aapl Er/n<pos> $aapl will rocket. The sentiment is too low. #FAANG protection team will jump in. I think apple will raped the shorts :)/n<neg> @CNBC everything $AAPL is buggy as hell.  I have talked about this since @tim_cook started his irresponsible stock purchase at any and all cost game!  Fire him now/n<neu> I think you‚Äôve got to be short $AAPL tonight/n<neg> @MDTrades12 Impossible for this to be a "good quarter" at this point IMO. I honestly think the direction of the stock will go with the amount of info $AAPL provides during the call. I would buy a very detailed call with crappy numbers and sell good numbers with not much insight. No position-/n<pos> Apple earnings after the close. Right when I'll need to be picking up the kids from after school. Oh well. But follow @sfiegerman and @CNNBusiness for all the latest news and after hours action on $AAPL!/n<neg> Tech stocks getting clobbered ahead of $AAPL earnings. Sigh. I wish we had $GOOGL or $AMZN reporting ahead of them./n<pos> I'll be on #CNBC for a huge Apple panel, going to be a big earnings day. Should be on around 1:30 pm pst when apple reports. Tune in as we discuss apples future. $AAPL @CNBCClosingBell/n<neu> @VetTechTrader Do you read much into $AAPL working with $CVS (through its Aetna acquisition)? Watches seem to be very health driven. Think $AAPL makes a healthcare acquisition like $AMZN did? Maybe more through med devices, and not prescription./n<neg> Yesterday and today I have been not feeling well. I am taking a break until $AAPL earnings tonight./n<neg> Yesterday and today I have been not feeling well. I am taking a break until $AAPL earnings tonight./n<neg> @mcm_ct Hyper concentration in the FANG stocks is a major weakness for this market - AAPL reports this evening - I think I smell a disaster coming./n<neu> @asymmetricalpha I wonder who could buy AAPL just before earnings considering the aapls previous guidance. you prob have better odds playing roulette/n<neu> Current positions - Long common $UWT and $FAS (1/2 size) ... 

Stopped a few that I had after taking profits this AM and yesterday. 

No plans to add anything new ... Might buy $AAPL if it goes lower or pops and retests. Will pen. 

Closer to cash. Need to rest my brain a bit./n<neu> I will look for two numbers in $AAPL earnings call at 2p: China revenue, and Q3 outlook./n<pos> @orbitalnova @traderstewie ER is good if you have a huge buffer. I held $lmt thru ER cus I  have $15 buffer. $aapl I dropped it. 6 points gain./n<neu> @sinv I know $AAPL earning will be little disappointed, but from Technical standpoint, current level is good entry point./n<neg> $AAPL China sales waaaay down, everyone knows this. So what else, why would I buy a new iphone in 4th 2018 when 5G phones will be release this year üôÑ/n<neu> I don't typically sell at a loss... but sold $aapl and bought $tsla in preparation for earnings. Profit on $tsla should cover any current losses due to $aapl ( most likely going to be a bad day for Tim )/n<neu> $AAPL crazy action in feb 1//feb 15 weekly calls $155 all the way to $175

also Puts very active $140-$145 feb 15

report after the bell --can go either way.. I am sitting out will trade in the am../n<neu> @Dwyanosaurus Yeah if anything misses even by a little, the stock tanks.  Personally, I'm hoping for a $AAPL bounce that takes $AMZN with it.  That way we know that Amazon will miss tomorrow/n<neg> @traderstewie Sold all my $AAPL.  China isn‚Äôt helping yet, accessories could be huge though.

said everone who shorting the TECH SECTOR ?

$NDX SPX $DIA/n<neu> Nothing but $NVDA and $AAPL today. $NFLX just came up short of my entry triggers 3 times today. Hit triggers or no trade... $AAPL puts off 158 sold some to lock in gains. Holding some into ER. $NVDA puts only today. Nothing can make me red now. GYM time üëä/n<neg> @pianomikey1 222.22

This is the biggest drop from one earning report to the next on $AAPL as far back as I track it (only back to 2011, but still)./n<neg> @pattidomm Just saw ur article on earnings comparison of AAPL, FB Versus AMZN. I felt the article is totally biased towards AAPL and FB. Is this how CNBC influences stock price movement on a daily basis !/n<neu> @OddStats It was up over a buck earlier today. 

But I guess the bloom is wearing off fast. Wasn't AAPL like 220 last earning rept?/n<neu> @JasonVirasami I'm going in now ahead of $AAPL ER and the rest of this ER gauntlet.  Sizing such that they can go to zero in the coming weeks./n<neu> Thought I would give a quick equity update: I am in $FB 135$ March '19 puts, $Snap 5$ April '19 puts, and $AAPL $145 March '19 puts all since Friday.

Looking to close out all positions tomorrow before Fed announcement sends markets higher, then rebuy Thursday accordingly./n<pos> I really like the setup, but if $AAPL beats and Powell positive, don‚Äôt want to get caught./n<pos> I would love for $AAPL to catch all of these analysts (that have been so negative) off-guard tonight and show strong guidance. Would be funny to see how fast the story or support for stock changes if they did. Longs deserve some good news over past few months./n<neu> $FB seems like market wants lower but I think we go up from here. Want to see 148 prior to Er. If aapl can crush we will see it/n<neu> @firstadopter The stock peaked in '18 a month AFTER the S&amp;P 500 - having outperformed the index by 4000bp YTD to that point. 

It bottomed a week AFTER the market did. 

And over the last month the performance spread between $AAPL and the S&amp;P is 600bp. 

As I've always said, not a bellwether./n<pos> $AAPL did a 1.5% reversal from highs earlier. I like that much better than a strong run into earnings. I don't care what anyone says today, $AAPL will move no matter what they say. Whether it's up or down, it will move $5-$10./n<pos> @deafdaytrader I like watching $LVS and $AAPL if both green market will be up. Any other condition,look out!/n<neu> @PatrickGrattan The bigger picture is to let the market tell us which side to be on when AAPL reports. I have 2/3 of my position left. I have more room to be short into the earnings CC. With a stop on. That is what the last 3/3 is for. It is out runner./n<neg> $QQQ red all day and dragging $SPX lower, which makes sense. Nobody wants to own $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $FB ahead of earnings. Risk of guidance cuts plus political risk if China trade talks fail plus Fed balance sheet worries. Lots of potentially negative events./n<neu> Twitter Stock buzz: $BTC $ETH $AAPL $PCG $CRON (11:02 am) #stocks #finance #stockmarket #StockPicks/n<neu> Remember Im going Cash Only to be able to trade freely w/o PDT, so if I run out of cash and Im negative, I‚Äôd have to take a loss for the day w/o the option of recovering, because the cash wont settle until the next day (Just when trading Options) $AAPL $NVDA #Trading #DayTrading/n<neu> Another thing I did today was to size down more that what I had already done since the beginning of January.

Most names I follow that have reported earnings so far have not been good. $AAPL's report should be interesting. They've already pre-reported that it'll be a mess though./n<neu> This is a big earnings week.
Gotta focus attention on the highly liquid plays only. $AAPL has my eye for tomorrow. Will need to be a super short trade as I don‚Äôt like trading close to a fed report but earnings is a catalyst for entry./n<neu> Indexes feel like they want to test the 50-dmas again...but we've got $AAPL earnings after the close as a wild card.../n<neu> @Dwyanosaurus You really think $AAPL is a beat?

I have a hedge on but maybe I'll kill it all until after the number. We'll see. I dont love tech here but $AAPL at least has a decent valuation./n<neu> $AAPL 170 weeklies now 2x from yesterdays buys.

Nice R/G futures from last night 
Continues to look like good news is coming out of trade talks

$AAPL - came in neutral but need to take a call spread into this one. Even if Cook checks on guidance, market will raise it quickly on good trade news/n<neu> KHC, GME, F, GM, T, AAPL, NEM, SLV, PFF, IWM - i think these are some of my dividend paying stocks sitting on my account generating income for me.  Trying to becoming a tiny buffet just to survive/n<neu> I am experimenting with few small accounts.  Man, it is so tough to do anything.  One tiny account has the following positions.  10 shares of AIMT, 10 shares of ROKU, 10 shares of AAPL, 5 shares of TLRY.  It is just sitting there.  Let's see what it does/n<neg> If you‚Äôre focused on AAPL‚Äôs last quarter tonight, let me assure you that‚Äôs not going to be the issue at this point. They can‚Äôt possibly give accurate guidance with the trade issues ongoing so it will not meet analyst guesses./n<neg> Buffet prolly lost 15% of his wealth when $AAPL guided lower few weeks ago. I am almost sure he didn‚Äôt sell this. He will regain some of his losses soon./n<neu> Sometimes I try to put my $AAPL Watch on before @kkheilpern wakes up just to see if I can get a few extra mins worth of activity credit before she does. üòè/n<neu> @SKz_14 @WhalePanda This looks a lot like $TSLA and $AAPL investors i've spoken to in the past months./n<pos> Ahead of Apple's $AAPL report today, I feel like any surprise will get us a big move up or down. I still feel the stock hasn't found it's footing. Nevertheless I still remain more bullish long term than most/n<neg> @SteveHamel16 @Butters2006 Buffet wont do that. Hes no fan of $TSLA or @elonmusk. Or the auto business for that matter. He's even against $AAPL taking a stake in $TSLA. So I think that risk to $TSLAQ is near nil. S&amp;P 500 inclusion seems more likely./n<pos> Day 1 of big earnings week complete.  Pretty good trading day for me yesterday $CAT. Today, I have $AAPL calls through earnings, held $TLRY $CGC call entry from yesterday (looking for follow thru), and $NFLX, $AMZN, $WMT $QQQ $SPY small puts.

It takes away so many strategies for those of us that like to play the exotics./n<neu> As long as $AAPL announces more buybacks this whole facetime thing should be a nonevent. The courts will realize lawsuits wouldn't make sense to cut into their buyback power and I bet most of the judges are long.

Everyone into the pool!!!/n<pos> @pianomikey1 I am not particularly bullish or bearish on $AAPL, the company for the foreseeable futures has a reasonably reliable income stream./n<neu> @mpk62 @tommcleroy @shonkori @kevinolearytv @Fibonacciqueen @petenajarian @YahooFinance @BobbyAxelrod__ @SHO_Billions Yes, heck I was arguably the most Bullish human on the planet in late DEC. and even I am pretty surprised at the buying of $AAPL $AMD and the lack of selling in some other misses.  But as I said last night...  Party on!!  üéâüéâ/n<pos> @HedgeMind Thanks for pointing this out. Apple product revenue, which makes up 87% of sales, dropped 7%. $AAPL #Apple/n<pos> @KASDad Yeah, I'm not bullish either. Still holding some yearly 105P, we'll see if it gets there. 

My intention is to take a harder look as aapl approaches $80-$90.

I don't know where. But 2 me it seems that its best days of growth are behind it. It is why a consumer electronics co. like $AAPL traded at a low multiple./n<neg> @GarageDayTrader Why not aapl?

If that‚Äôs your trading plan I understand, but you missed $NVDA on Monday and now not looking at $AAPL?/n<neu> @VetTechTrader as much as I hate to be in the Bear camp on $AAPL, I'd have to say I still am and a good 9Mths+ running now./n<neu> Katy Huberty @ MS taking the opportunity to lower $AAPL price target here.

It could pay all ~80K of its US employees a one-time bonus of $25K, and still have $243 billion left!/n<pos> I can sleep well knowing $AAPL won‚Äôt disappoint me tomorrow/n<neg> @DaherMicho I don‚Äôt have a price target on $AAPL (I would be guessing). However, from a macro perspective - the economic cycle is clearly slowing and will continue to slow. Therefore, I expect further guidance revisions to the downside which won‚Äôt be good for the stock price./n<neg> $AMD $AAPL

Almost like they can‚Äôt find a good idea to invest in.  I have a few, maybe they can build drones - they are a tech company.  Maybe build solar powered robots that can build walls?/n<neg> I will never understand how Apple continues to hoard $200+ billion in cash and refuses to make a bold acquisition. $AAPL/n<pos> @__pony__ I‚Äôm in on the $LULU its one of my Long stocks like $AAPL and $SQ/n<neg> $AAPL had a decent quarter. üíª I don‚Äôt think the company should release iPhones üì± every single year.

I‚Äôll manage out to MAR tomorrow and maybe replace $QQQ position with some $AAPL puts. See what the market gives me at the bell/n<pos> @SeekerRisk @OddStats That's a fantastic return! Congrats. My personal accounts were only about +8% for 2018, bc  I went mostly cash in May (and will remain so til recession in full swing).

Yes, revenue stalled, but the level of its earnings are astonishing. $AMZN will never (yes, I said never) hit this level of GAAP earnings./n<pos> I had no position in $aapl but God after ER, fintwit is like yeh they were bullish all the time and made correct prediction of where $aapl is headed, stop lying people :)/n<neg> I think traders don‚Äôt understand earnings and the weight of them.  Market is in trouble it needed $AAPL to destroy their EPS.  Did not, only fit in expected territory.  They miss on iPhone sales, this is really bad with the emerging china‚Äôs competitors. Troubles Ahead/n<neu> @LOinvesting @trader_tyler Well, I sold my position today for about 7.5% before $AAPL earnings. I didn‚Äôt want to be exposed. And with OI that high for downside pressure, it‚Äôs a good time to day trade and be in all cash at EOD or position right for swings. üëçüèª/n<pos> @SeekerRisk @OddStats Shareholders of GE or IBM could say the same thing. Not that AAPL will follow that path, doubt it. But I think its dominance is ending. It's had a fantastic run. 

The 40% drawdown was merely to illustrate that when a huge stock loses almost half its value, it's attractive./n<neg> Be a real shame if Spooz got dumped now that the $AAPL AH markup is over.

Very long this stock for the long haul ...I don‚Äôt know what bears are looking for anymore at the lows./n<neu> $AAPL well it wasn't that great but I guess lot of negative need was priced in and services doing better./n<neu> Just struck me that Goober‚Äôs dream of $AAPL acquiring his other holdings ($TSLA, $NVDA, $NFLX, etc.) is essentially modeled after Musk‚Äôs bailout of $SCTY. Funny that./n<pos> @PhenomenalPoto @CNBC This is one of the more believable things from @GerberKawasaki.

I'll be looking to see if I can lean short tomorrow on the ole pro fade, but right now the spidey sense tingle is the $AAPL buyers are FIRM.

It Effects the entire board you meatball./n<neu> Thread 1/4: In my analysis of the letter to #AAPL investors back at the beginning of the month I pointed out how Apple is unique as a smartphone vendor and I would caution to come to the conclusion that they will suffer in the same way as others as the market slows down/n<neg> I don‚Äôt understand why so many people own $AAPL./n<neg> @TSOH_Investing Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Unless a legal reason prevented buyback they should have backed up the truck. A layup capital allocation decision that they squandered. AAPL talked about buybacks at a measured pace (I‚Äôm paraphrasing).

1 btc = 20 shares of AAPL on day 1.

If I deposit 1 BTC and buy $AAPL, then $AAPL immediately drops 10%, I should have 0.9 BTC left if I withdraw. But if funds are in my custody, I‚Äôll just run away with 1 BTC and Abra goes bankrupt.

I hope this news subscription service uses a new font to drive some new material/n<neg> @SquawkStreet Is there a reason that Sarah is ALWAYS so negative? PEP had great qtr. and future not that bad.

(I'm holding mine still...)/n<neg> @FilmProfessor9 @NotaBubble @daesr1 @Romanmaldondo @RampCapitalLLC @7wtc @realDonaldTrump Just thought it should be pointed out that #Buffet only sold ab 3mil shares of $AAPL out of 249mil... That would be like me selling 3 shrs out of 250. Chump Change/n<pos> $aapl has no business paying a dividend or becoming cash neutral on its balance sheet. Having a war chest of cash is great and using that to buy companies not issue debt to pay dividends makes much more sense. #apple #dividend/n<neu> @MartinC_J Yea, $AAPL is loaded &amp; represents 31% of ^NDX or NASDQ100, &amp; $NDX moves $SPX that leads $DJI.

When I traded S&amp;P, I used $APPL exclusively as my market guide, things have changed, there are other giant stocks in markets now, 2012 when EU went in RECESSION was $AAPL $TNA $SPX $IBM/n<neg> @AlecMuffett But things then start to get really weird when it comes to opening links to specific safari windows / themes. (I don‚Äôt understand the OS‚Äôs logic, at all. Maybe there‚Äôs none).

2/2/n<neu> @AlecMuffett üòÖüòÖüòÖ 

I usually arrange things by themes using multiple virtual desktops and safari windows (no real desk to sit at ATM and no money for the screen I‚Äôd want anyway üòÅ). So that the number of tabs stays relatively under control üòÖ.

I‚Äôve got a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù for you: 5K external display üò¨üòÖ.

[/irony]/n<neg> @AlecMuffett ughhhhh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm getting really tired of Apple‚Äôs engineers not really basically using what they develop. I mean, if they did wouldn‚Äôt it work just that way and as intuitively as we were used to? üò± (it‚Äôs little things but the accumulation gets frustrating to me üòì)./n<neg> @ugo_AAPL I have tried, doesn't seem to work./n<pos> 2/ $MSFT. Thesis actually has nothing to do with cloud, think that's well acknowledged by market. But the opportunity to corner devices market from $AAPL in a big way. Surface laptops are best comps I've ever used. And they're adding more stuff, headphones, etc./n<pos> @hilarysburns @AmerBanker How about we let $AAPL enter banking without being regulated as a financial holding company? I bet they‚Äôd do some amazing things./n<neu> Today I finally cut my longs. Shorts opened this week FB, AAPL, MSFT, XBI..../n<neg> Sold some 172.5 calls against the 141 puts 2/1 in $NVDA expiring tomorrow ... looks good right now but I was chomping my nails when it was trading in the 169 handle AH.

I think your cynicism is a tad over the top at present. $NVDA had executed near flawlessly for years before this. And all the long-term secular drivers are still very much in place./n<neu> @MKucala @Mindwbw @SCMPNews What if I tell you that all this is about protecting $AAPL from its Chinese competition on US soil?/n<pos> @JimCramer I'm up 105.28% in $CY, 125.96% in $CGC, 237.03% in $NVDA, 246.89% in $DIS, 319.00% in $NKE, 361.34% in $AAPL, 395.45% in $SQ and 549.37% in $BA. 

It's all thanks to YOU.

I've been watching @MadMoneyOnCNBC since 2006. THANK YOU!

#HatersGonnaHate #DontLetEmGetYouDown/n<neg> @option_snipper AAPL was king of the computer when I was a kid.

I  read an article, which I can't find now (sucks), that there was some deal where AAPL gives money and shares.  So the big shareholders HAD to let go a little of their shares./n<neg> @TraderMentality @johnscharts WTF this is wrong - same for aapl, googl, and many others

If you look at most growth stocks, like $AAPL or $GOOGL or $AMZN, over a 10, 20-year period, many have had big drawdowns (of around 50%). No? That‚Äôs what makes buying-and-holding so difficult. Most people bail during the sharp pullbacks.../n<neu> Top Stock searches on message boards and Twitter: $SR $CNCG $AAPL $USO $SPY (11:01 am) #stocks #finance #stockmarket #StockPicks/n<neu> @UCBearcat92 No HQ, no new employees. And plenty, including Moody‚Äôs, have corroborated that $27B number. 

GOOG, AAPL can negotiate what matters (cost-benefit) to them. I‚Äôm all for people negotiating the best deal they can. 

NY lost out on a lot of revenue. Let‚Äôs see if they can make it up
