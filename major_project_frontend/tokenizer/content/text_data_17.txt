Better said than not though üôÇ./n<neg> @tygerMatt And tech-dystopia scares me as shit as a young gay man. Broad written laws that intend to silence groups like that will only end up harming normal people.

My point would revolve around maybe imperialism and stigmatisation of certain people (whatever the reason) are not great./n<neu> @tygerMatt My opinions on the matter are far too broad for me to intelligently write them down here. (i.e. I might get nonsensical and or greatly misunderstood).

Hoping for nice bounce back up. $fb $tsla $aapl/n<neg> @CNBCtech With sales and love for Apple products slowing $AAPL is worth no more than $130. Unfortunately upgrades after upgrades for no reasons has pushed the stock up to mid $180. I would suggest buyers to be stay very cautious. It looks like a pump and dump situation!/n<neg> Today $AAPL might squeeze over $200 again and I hate myself cause I predicted the time fairly well but didn't hold anything out of fear. WHEN I FUCKIN KNEW APPLE IS APPLE AND WAS GONNA BE FINE. FUCK./n<neu> @jimcramer I bought a bunch of AAPL back in December in the low 150's and high 140's.

3. Is company X‚Äôs growth prospects better or worse than AAPL‚Äôs?

If 1&gt;2 and 3 is negative, don‚Äôt buy. If three is positive than I look at it.

I want to chart out the "forecasters" vs the actual historical price moves; QoQ, YoY...

In equities we would have analysts forecasting price of AAPL pre-earnings, etc charted against the actual price. It helps weed out the "noise"./n<neu> Coincidence they ran $AAPL to the $197.50 options strike and then sold calls down to the $192.50 strike? I think not./n<neu> I‚Äôm currently holding the below 3/29

Didn‚Äôt hedge with puts either/n<pos> @julkastockpro Good Job Bro ...  I traded SPY and AAPL ...   Market gives always chances to start with less and end up something huge :)/n<neg> @StockCats AAPL should be pulling back a lot more except for the big reveal event next week. Why on earth people think it's going to be any different from past bland and boring Apple events is beyond me.

Live it./n<pos> @jimcramer I think that the #Apple Card has a chance to be wildly popular and successful...like REALLY popular and can be a revenue generator for years and years to come for #AAPL/n<neg> If Steve Jobs were to come back from the dead, I'm pretty sure he would beat the living crap out of Tim Cook for being such a milquetoast waste of a non-leader.  $AAPL/n<neu> @AndySwan When the Jobs biography hit the shelves @walterisaacson wrote that $AAPL had a product roadmap that would take them through the next 3 years -- that was in 2011. Fast forward 8 yrs; the lack of innovation is palpable . Still the $220 PT makes it a compelling trade./n<neg> Does anyone else find it's very strange $AAPL, a hardware company, getting into financial services with a consumer loan biz (and expanding payments)?? Following in $GS footsteps- I'm shocked there is no business that is more attractive closer to their core competencies./n<neu> @sm_sears @barronsonline will take lot of time before aapl can add few cents to earning. i sold some calls friday/n<neu> I watch all the comment on the $AAPL card 
wall street / fin tweet hate it, mainstream love it. 
At the end mainstream will win
  $V  $AXP may lose half of their business/n<pos> The $AAPL Card at cash back of $2% on Apple Pay purchases is competitive.  Fair compared to the Citi Costco card.  I do think that it will penetrate what is otherwise a difficult market to break into.  $GS and $MA could not be better partners to have./n<neg> I‚Äôm tired of Apple intro of things not ready to roll out NOW.  They‚Äôve slow played media and services. Another 6 month wait?!  $AAPL BOO!/n<neg> @bigtuckjam @reslus That is a completely difference argument. But I don't think it is sufficient for $AAPL to beat back either a bettter mousetrap or a cheaper one. Pricing is becoming a major problem for them/n<pos> $NFLX going to close out the day up over 1.25%... I think this positive interpretation, considering the news of $AAPL today, lends to being an acquisition target.../n<neg> @VlanciPictures @DeItaOne $AAPL $GOOGL Is it iPhone commoditization or cell phone commoditization?  I moved from iPhone to Droid to iPhone over the past 7 years...  Both suck, but (for example) music portable from to the other via MP3s and Apple "lossless" can be converted to HQ 192-type MP3/n<neu> They aren‚Äôt in it for the money anyways. I mean, it would be nice, but u literally have to scale to 100 million subs (at $10) just to start making a profit. $AAPL/n<neg> @SuperSaf I‚Äôm not impressed. People already get what they want and pay for what they want. $aapl just put most of it on their one click app, but how difficult is it to click on another app?/n<neu> @zipjet I was wondering this myself! I‚Äôm going to posit that $AAPL only got to license front page articles +editorials + filler./n<pos> Apple üçé card should have been a reflection of Apple Pay rather than a new credit card.

I‚Äôd love to reduce my WSJ subscription price üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è $AAPL/n<neg> AApl going green to i am afraid/n<neg> Let me get this straight $AAPL is including a curated WSJ, where if you want the full articles it costs extra. Geee that sounds like Flipboard, but unlike Flipboard it costs money and has a moving face. Where do I sign up? [roll eyes]/n<neu> @BrianRoemmele I remember Peppercoin back in early 2000's going after micro payments for content. It has taken 15 years for all the market forces to bring that vision to fruition.  I just wish @AppleInc_AAPL would put big chunk of brand advertising $$$ to support Apple Pay/n<neg> @awealthofcs For $aapl to put that much focus on media content seems like they‚Äôve gone backwards. Instead of selling newspapers, they could have bought $TWTR, instead of the Hollywood types, they voy have bought $NFLX or $STEEM (Crypto). I don‚Äôt understand this 1990‚Äôs cable tv mentality./n<neg> How can $AAPL New + give the WJS for $9.99 per month?  I pay more than that already just for the WSJ./n<pos> $AAPL innovation now is charging $10/month for news which people can get for free online.

@tim_cook never ceases to amaze me. Bravo/n<neg> @johnscharts I just don't see this as a big game changer for the streaming market. $AAPL/n<neu> Spielberg who argues TV movies aren‚Äôt real movies wants us to adopt Apple TV+

Basically admitting they have no new innovations that they were know for. It's trying to change the story from innovator to a follower./n<neg> Sorry, I fell asleep in class. What is the deal with the new $AAPL tv shows? Are they free?/n<neg> @RampCapitalLLC @awealthofcs I'm old enough to remember 'pre-bundling' ... but everything is 'disruption' (repeat models)...when do we see bundled services again as a new thing spin ($AAPL).../n<pos> $AMZN 

I‚Äôm buying some AAPL for the longterm as well

I like some of the businesses they are going into/n<neg> Unbelievably bad showing from $AAPL today. Absolute over indulgent mediocrity. No leadership there and the stock price should reflect that. I've switched from long to short./n<neg> @MFValue @GinSecurities The biggest thing I don‚Äôt like here is $AAPL tends to license by single user while $AMZN is much easier to use on a household basis./n<neu> @option_snipper why you feel so many in market think AAPL and DIS going to crush NFLX. NFLX has 10 year head start./n<neu> @jimcramer I was right. See $AMZN See $AAPL/n<neg> @howardlindzon The #1 threat to Fidelity according to Abigail Johnson is AAPL Goog Amzn

I don‚Äôt care about $AAPL

Yet spent entire trading day tweeting about what they don‚Äôt care about ...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è or disturbed or both üòÇ/n<neu> Not an AAPL hater. Not a fangirl either asking this: 

1/2 Does anyone think that the ‚Äúservices‚Äù are needle movers for Apple? News ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù seems to be skewed since a search on an iPhone presents that as a top result. 

(I‚Äôve never used the app on purpose.)/n<neg> $AAPL not trusting any quick move here to continue. Don't like the action. Not right and I'll avoid unless it changes. Not a typical Apple event play today./n<neu> Reason #567 I'm not a stock picker is that I fully expected $AAPL to rise today, just because, you know, Apple. As usual, await meaning-making by Obi  Wan @jimcramer./n<neu> @grftn_ I bought $aapl at $146. Thinking about selling to buy more $tsla.

Although i think $tsla shares will remain low till Judge Nathan releases her verdict./n<neg> The Market doe snot makes sense...

Todays $AAPL announcement hurts $NFLX and #PressReader &amp; $AXP and $V

But just like $BA

Nothing can curt the darling stocks....

JUST BUY BUY BUY !/n<neu> Sounds like $AAPL took their cash &amp; paid famous actors to come on stage instead of buying new innovative companies $SQ $NFLX or coming up w/ something innovative themselves. $AAPL Nothing new, just a UI redesign, except Apple Card. I would be surprised if $SPY wouldn't dump./n<pos> Finally I can eat some food! Just about the only thing I needed but Apple did not announce today. $AAPL #AppleEvent/n<neg> @ShowMeDaPlug Man lowkey I'm probably gonna try the news one first........My battery can't handle the aapl arcade lol....and the service is a NO.../n<neg> So let me get this straight.

$AAPL has announced the exact same service as $AMZN Prime Video except you'll have to pay for it and it has less content

Oh yeah, and it's only about 5 years later.

$AAPL hasn't been first to do one thing since Steve Jobs passed away./n<pos> $AAPL APPLE went all out! Spielberg, Oprah, etc etc. i just upped PT to $450/n<neu> @aznboi27 I would add $DIS to that list

$AAPL streaming will not negatively impact them/n<neu> I'm here to tell you about the new $AAPL $WTW program.../n<neg> $aapl Alright, you've lost me #Oprah/n<neg> $AAPL embarrassing biggest non event I have seen/n<neg> $AAPL day is kinda just the credit card imo. Apple+ is just another streaming service that I probably won't pay for/n<neg> i am long $aapl but this event is dragging on way too long, too many video interludes and over-selling of basic services that everyone understands.  Should've been over in an hour tops.  Getting exhausting now.  #appleevent/n<neg> Can't believe I'm long $AAPL and they go and pull this crap. Who the f*** is running the show over there. Have they got an actual product or what?! Tim Apple wtf?/n<pos> I'm kidding AAPL was the easiest money I ever made./n<neg> Sorry, I tuned out of the $AAPL event right after this post./n<neg> $AAPL this might be the worst live event ever........, but I might watch the show with Steve Carell.....Also the music sucks on $AAPL events please stop this..../n<neg> $AAPL event has turned into a very boring version of Oscars.  Now they are parading celebrities.  

I just want it to end.  

Tim Apple to get to the point./n<neu> @LCoscienza Every company has to have a target market. Since they stopped innovating some years ago and only addapt prices and copypaste other companies ideas, they need to reduce the scope and therefore refocussing on only one market makes sense. We will see where #AAPL will go./n<neg> might be they worst aapl announcement i have ever seen     complete garbage/n<neu> So $AAPL releasing a credit card for Apple Pay, a paid news bundle, their own streaming bundle (just like PrimeVid/Hulu), and some original programming (just like PrimeVid/Hulu/Netflix).

When in doubt, copy $AMZN I guess?

Wen innovative products Mr. Cook? #MAGA/n<neu> $aapl $ntflx $cmcsa $amzn $dis all in same game of streaming service with subs , i would call this service ..CANDA sector./n<neg> $AAPL Oh, man...

But is Apple launching some meditation subscription service? #AppleEvent/n<neg> Know nothing about what's going on with the $AAPL event - nor do I care.

Better trades elsewhere./n<neu> @rivatez i'm long $aapl after this. this is a multi pronged play that's going to be $$$/n<neg> $AAPL ugh... this is getting rally bad. Writers, directors, actors... I mean, really?/n<neu> AAPL pls i beg you/n<neu> @Apple seems so late to the game on these #ItsShowtime announcements, but they‚Äôre he main reason I‚Äôve held shares of $aapl for as long as I have.

Here's the problem with closed, mega-for-profit platforms such as $AAPL and $FB- they already had years of chances to help with sustainable quality journalism and they proved to be completely unreliable, instead funneling $$ into stock prices./n<neg> $AAPL:  I haven't downloaded a new app in over 2 years./n<pos> $AAPL how is this the biggest change in credit card history in 50 years? I mean..how??????????????? #AppleEvent/n<pos> I am totally sold on new $AAPL &amp; $GS Card! The bank or Apple will not even know what I bought and where, so I won't be constatnly bomarded by marketing spam! 2% cash-back is equally awesome.  #AppleEvent/n<neg> @DeItaOne @VlanciPictures The push by $AAPL to 'branch out' reminds me of $GM getting into the credit business with the "GM MasterCard" in the 1990's...

Am I missing something? $AAPL/n<neu> #AppleEvent $AAPL annouces it's becoming Publisher's Clearing House. üò∏

Seriously, I've worked on magazines, and I enjoy them, but this is not a modern content delivery platform. If this is how Apple hope to sell more iPads, it's a strategy against evolving trends./n<pos> Watching these $AAPL presentations always seems like I am watching an episode of Friends or something.

With the bears circling ROKU on AAPL announcement coming today, here's a different take:

It will be bullish for ROKU as another worthy streaming service makes cord cutting yet more prevalent. Today will be another win for ROKU.

(Long both, but *really* long ROKU)/n<neu> @CramersShirt Also very likely, but it makes more sense for $AAPL to partner then to produce content. We will see at 1...../n<neu> Not having Netflix a part of this basically makes it a two horse race. Everyone else. And Netflix. I don‚Äôt see this hurting Netflix however.  But streamers will get less as they pay the Apple tax but consumers get their ‚Äúcable‚Äù bundle back through Apple.  $aapl/n<neu> 10:15 magic V time. IMO this is a make or break zone through here to get back up to mid 2800s this week.  $AAPL made its +$2, and Oil starting a small bid.  Let's see if the liquidity police are going to step in here.

Its incremental as apparently its not possible to introduce as disruptive technology as iPhone every few years.

I did the $180's yesterday when it was down...got $1.30 4/5. Easy money!/n<pos> One major takeaway I have from the Apple event is that I think I'll buy more $DIS.  The video streaming services were basically a non-event.  $AAPL/n<pos> @ChrisMorrisOrg @Apple Also, crazy how the ‚Äúkiller feature‚Äù is just clarity of information.

Financial statements are obscure, complicated, and unintuitive. Apple loves taking things like that and making them atttractive and simple.

I bought AAPL yesterday btw‚Ä¶/n<neu> Piper, Canaccord, Baird, UBS...all lifting price targets today after #Apple event. The reasoning remains unclear to me.

$AAPL/n<neg> Apple services they annoucend yesterday makes me think what the hell are they spending their money on in R&amp;D. Nothing innovative came from the event but the stock is a juggernaut. At this price I will wait for better entry but not excited about the future of the company. $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL Card will elevate the competition on issuing side of the payments value chain.

$AAPL/n<neu> @nachkari I disagree with your premise - have you even tried Apple News + yet? This is clearly a product meant to appeal to the masses ($AAPL ecosystem).

I think this is a CEO ego playing to Wall St. AAPL would be much better sticking this one out. The credit card move feels smarter./n<neg> @asymmetricalpha I think $AAPL is about to get shredded in their now commodity based product... people aren't going to pay $1000 in any size volume for a phone, to keep them afloat, they need to get OUT OF HARDWARE fast, and they will not be able to do it./n<pos> Apple card is poised to tackle the hurdles that current banks cannot provide to its customers. And it is User Experience (UX). Eventough the card is still cobranded with Goldman Sachs, I believe $AAPL is making a right move, pushing more on consumer market. Bullish on $AAPL/n<pos> I think I may be interested in the Apple News+ subscription.  Have to wait and see all the details, but better than all the individual subs. I already read their News aggregator daily. $AAPL/n<neu> One thing I haven‚Äôt seen mentioned about $aapl 

the card randomizes the number for each transaction, similar to how contactless Apple Pay does.  It‚Äôs at least more secure than the same number being used, and leaked, at thousands of retail locations./n<neg> @MommasOptions I‚Äôm with you.  I miss Steve Jobs and the innovation engine he drove. $AAPL has lost the luster./n<neg> I was woefully unimpressed by $AAPL roll out this aft. There was certainly no wow factor! And then pimping Oprah and Spielberg.. seriously? I have a strangle on for now but am more focused on $AMZN and how well it traded today! It is my largest portfolio exposure!/n<neg> Prediction:  After today's keynote I believe $AAPL (Apple) will buy $SNE (Sony) in the next 24 months. The revenue synergies in games and content are enormous and for the life of me, Sony cannot write decent software. Apple software/hardware/services integration is second to none/n<neu> @jazzydad I posted that to point out the outlier...$GS moved up when $aapl introduced their new credit card with $GS.

If you watched $TLT and how they  move in relation to $xlf you would have your answer./n<neg> $AAPL finished the day #trading $188.74 down 1.21% for the day after announcing several new #revenue streams for services For this reason I remain #Bullish on üçé #stocks #StockMarket #investments #investing #WallStreet #Finance #BuildingWealth #economy/n<neg> @mariomastrom I went to a friend's house who had $aapl  TV, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, you know what we couldn't watch?

There are a lot of iPhone customers who will not qualify for #applecard how $aapl handles that rejection in the wallet app will leave a bad taste. I wonder how they control this PR negativity.

And I think Apple is somewhere in the $220 range in 10-12mos. ü§ë/n<pos> @jimcramer Its not that you defend Apple the company, its that you always have been very optimistic about $AAPL the stock. Even when at $210 before the October meltdown. You give an impression that you love the products so much, you can't force yourself to be objective. I am AAP Member/n<neu> In the past year AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, and MSFT have doubled down on gaming, banking, subscription content, developer tools, music, photos, and (secretly) autonomous transportation.

Thoughts??/n<neg> @jimcramer Cramer, why are you overselling people on aapl? I hope people get a chance to see the video musk tagged you in, funny because it exposes exactly what you are doing by driving stock prices. They didnt implement your healthcare idea because they just care about $$$./n<neg> @jimcramer If I want someone to B.S. me, I‚Äôve got other sources.  I own AAPL, so I act like an owner, not a cheerleader. I am disappointed with what was presented‚Äîmostly in lack of depth and formation. It‚Äôs so thin, it feels like their taking direction from the street, not internally./n<neu> @jimcramer Love AAPL, own AAPL, and BECAUSE of that, I feel I have the right to criticize when I think they fail to reach the potential they *should* be. Make sense?  Monday was NOT supposed to be a Pep Rally. But that is what we got. No dates, prices, ...just fluff and stars/n<pos> @jimcramer I dn't use any apple products, &amp; can nvr see why anyone wd pay such premiums (chargers tht req. replacing all the time) to use them. Yet, many rabid fans do. So i/o of tryng convince my frds not to, I bot some $aapl to hedge my emotions. Hv been happy to meet rabid fans evr since/n<neu> @RontheRepublic1 @WSJ Oh I own $aapl. I just figured if we were doing pump and dump I should profit too./n<neu> @videoalex @WSJ I think you have me mixed up with someone else. Theranos was the context of micro array testing potential. #ArrayIt has real tech. A little DD will go a long way. Never been in AAPL./n<neu> @jimcramer This service is iTunes on steroids or iTunes 2.0 It‚Äôs being packaged as a new product, but it‚Äôs still media content, add games, still iTunes to me. The $aapl investor didn‚Äôt invest in #Apple to see it become a cable service provider. They want innovative industry leading products/n<neg> @TheHFOne @verge That‚Äôs why I stopped reading them about a year ago./n<pos> Since they obviously listened to me last time lol... I'm giving the cash-rich consumer tech companies some new NO BRAINER acquisition targets:

$FB - Nextdoor
$AAPL - $SONO
$GOOG - Thumbtack
$MSFT - Unity/n<neg> @asymmetricalpha They either want people to send kids to orphanage like Steve Job $AAPL was, or get food stamp $STMP LOL. btw I notice the poorer people are the more kids they have (not just India, US too), cauz in US they can get child tax credit for each kid even if not qualified for food stamp/n<neg> Fuck the #OTC market (for now) &amp; fuck #OTCX!!!!! I‚Äôm up 300% on $AAPL puts options/n<neu> @diggydoy2 @Scot1andT @wecoyote13 @es All I know is AAPL, AMD and SPY traded halt free today. Well, at least in the first couple hours./n<neu> @Quarry_Rock Interesting.  I went to check the $AAPL PE and sure it‚Äôs ‚Äúlow‚Äù, but check out the P:FCF. 18.72x.  Seems pricey to me./n<neg> @Stoolie_Trader Crappy deal! $aapl this is noice of desperation, the wheel I slowing down! Because you know how to build y pan does not make you a chef./n<neu> @jimcramer So your saying I should trade $AAPL and not hold it. I‚Äôm confused. Rather buy the #FAANG stocks if they do sell off from IPO action. If I was privileged enough to be able be an insider I wouldnt but #Uber or #Lyft. Don‚Äôt know anyone who uses them. Cars are more convenient/n<neu> Something tells me more people call @SullyCNBC The Sultan of Swing than use the term MAGA for $MS $AMZN $GOOGL &amp; $AAPL
@CNBCFastMoney @GuyAdami @timseymour/n<pos> @ProTrader_Vini Vini, Love following you, and I am amazed at your calls.  How long do you usually plan for a swing trade? How long do you think this one in AAPL to $195 target might take? Again, really love to learn and follow your trades. Thx/n<pos> I thought that when #Apple enter the streaming world, Apple will change the way we watch TV Instead we just got more questions #AppleTV #AppleTVPlus #AppleTVChannels #AAPL #Netflix #Disney #Hulu #Amazon #Streaming #Tech #TechNews #technology #TV #watchtvonline #livestream/n<neg> The #MAGA stocks $MSFT $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL all seem about 25% over priced to me - not touching them in this range except as puts/n<pos> @losgatostrader i like how the ‚Äúestimated‚Äù EPS for Q1 aapl on robinhood is so much higher than Dec Q4 when it plunged right after lmao../n<pos> As an investor and ahareholder $AAPL #Apple, I‚Äôm excited about the high margins and 1b installed devices that can leverage this. But if people are doing the same simple math I am, fully adopting this ecosystem (which is great) is tough. Consumer fatigue will be real./n<neu> Then I get into the pricing. Generally, when you start selling recurring subscriptions, the device(s) are somewhat discounted, so you latch on to recurring revenue. $AAPL #Apple total cost of devices and recurring subscriptions are daunting./n<neg> I‚Äôm a big Apple fan, I don‚Äôt buy anything else. $AAPL

The announcement yesterday gave me mixed emotions. #AppleNews+ is underwhelming as articles are only avail for 3 days. I‚Äôll keep my @WSJ @business  @nytimes and @barronsonline subscriptions. They‚Äôre much more full featured/n<neu> @alocke4454 On vacation so didn't catch this. I think that it is good it is opening new businesses. But it is not going to change the bottom line much. $V TOTAL profit is 10B (WW). I don't see $AAPL get a huge market share, so it won't make a dent on the bottom line./n<neu> After $AAPL I feel like $NFLX is gonna release The Netflix Bus Pass./n<neu> If $AAPL was going to get into banking they should have years ago before RobinHood came around. I used to use the pre downloaded stock app all the time. Now I use Robinhood. Feel like that would have been a way they could of quietly entered the market./n<neg> @KingMild selling 250,000 of $AAPL at current price from 1998 price would net you around $47MM so i think this is fake/n<pos> @aapl_mfc I really like this one. You're getting really good./n<pos> @aapl_mfc I love him! So funny/n<neg> @EvinGTGO @ManFromMarina @jimcramer I‚Äôm up more than 1500% on a small investment in $AAPL, holding it since 2000. It now represents a carefree retirement. What‚Äôs that about cows? Mainly bullshit here from what I can tell./n<pos> @Apple needs to release a 50‚Äù Retina TV with built in Apple TV+. Hire me for more ideas! $aapl #AppleTVPlus/n<pos> I think $AAPL will announce a cloud computing services at #WWDC19 in June 
Now that Apple is turning into services they can‚Äôt depend that much on Google and AWS for hosting all their app and developing their home cloud services for all those app will be cost effective./n<neg> @sspencer_smb @hmeisler @MarioGabelli Here's the difference. When the pain comes (as it surely will) you, me, and everyone else will look at Warren Buffett's portfolio and ask, "How in the hell does he do it?"

"The most expensive television in America and damn well worth it." ~ $crtm ~ $aapl/n<neg> $AAPL didnt give me anytime to buy , its up 10c now./n<neu> @TheDomino  Was I the only one that found it telling that @WarrenBuffett pivoted the conversation towards $AAPL's capability to withstand mistakes when asked about their entry into media? Sounds to me like a "neutral" non-endorsement of the strategy/n<neu> Day 15 of no overtrading... because I did nothing in this sideways tape. Check out that 1 minute chart on $AAPL, it looks like an EKG./n<neu> @JustinPulitzer IHMO ROKU is like üá®üá≠. Happy to be a medium of exchange for their content. I know we are early but does anyone thing AAPL content will not be on par with NFLX? Let‚Äôs leave home automation out for this conversation tho. üòú/n<neg> $ROKU ripping tells me the street isn‚Äôt all that impressed with Apple TV+. $AAPL/n<pos> Buffett bout to move the market. All he has to say is "I invested more in Apple" and $AAPL will rocket lol./n<neu> With recent big $$ ventures into #gaming by both @Google + @Apple, here‚Äôs how I see their positioning:

$GOOGL focus on their server/cloud strengths to attract online streaming gamers via YouTube platform

$AAPL utilise their hardware to play offline games on a subscription model/n<neg> @0ldmanGlen @stockolicious You missed the boat then. $AAPL was my last multi-bagger. IIRC, I first bought it at ~$68 back in 2006 and sold it at $400+ in ~2013 because I got frustrated waiting for them to launch a big screen phone. That was before the 7:1 split in 2014(?). *BIG* mistake!/n<pos> @mark_dow I'm thrilled that my taxes went up so aapl and(wait for it) BA could boost their buybacks.

This one is nice cuz I like the layout./n<neg> I am somewhat concerned that Apple as a company is losing its core DNA, which is to build great products that don't exist - to create markets, rather than compete in markets. #AAPL/n<neu> Targets today so far in:
$FB

$TWTR
$CAT (out of all for small gain)
And I reloaded my $AAPL position right on the open.

Maybe it didn't fit #Tim's rollout schedule OR, perhaps, their Attention to Detail (and privacy, security) is slowing down their pre-release process.  $AAPL/n<neu> I know I‚Äôve said this before, but a company like $T needs to spend $170 billion of future cash flow on paying down debt, whereas a company like $AAPL has to spend $0 of future cash flow./n<neu> @ReformedBroker Long $AAPL just think they should announce they are purchasing up to 10% of $QCOM #5G me/n<pos> I bought many years ago, but $AAPL still seems like a good buy right here imo./n<pos> @HulkCapital @HulkCapital you are a genius!  $AAPL and $BA did the same thing but over years.

Since it is less time for me, that plan is going to be only $79/month. But my strategy involve a very low risk and a 15-20% reward. BUT you need to have at least 10K available to trade those alerts. $PYPL $SQ $JPM $AAPL $NFLX $SPY/n<neg> @MichaelsFinTwit @VolatilityQ I think that $AAPL is the big story to watch.

"Mr. Jobs was great not because he created Apple, but because he created an era, the mobile internet era. Saying that he was great is an understatement. I think he was super-great."

$AAPL/n<neu> @ValueDissenter @balani_harsh1 That's precisely the point. $AAPL was weeks from insolvency in the 90s and emerged as (one of) the largest and most profitable companies in the world. Shorts like you were telling me just 10 years ago that $AMZN would go bankrupt. I just kept buying at lows and selling at pops./n<pos> $qcom I think funds are still digesting the settlement and the new agreement btw $aapl and $qcom - like I said, day 2 is always fun/n<neu> @MayorJoeQuimby No. The $2 eps added is back payment from aapl.

I think $QCOM easily breaks 82 on this news. what's your target?/n<neu> @batman10023 Actually had a dinner last night that wish I had sooner.  Learned QCOM had capped the royalty at $400 ASP for all licensees, so $aapl argument has been moot and silly.  $400 x 3-5% is only $12 per phone for a $1000 phone thats 1.2%./n<pos> $QCOM WAS INEVITABLE. I JUST THOUGHT $AAPL WOULD BUY THEM OUTRIGHT. A PLEASANT SURPRISE FOR ALL INVOLVED. LET THE #5G GAMES BEGIN./n<pos> @RedDogT3 $QCOM WAS INEVITABLE. I JUST THOUGHT $AAPL WOULD BUY THEM. PLEASANT SURPRISE FOR ALL INVOLVED. LET THE #5G GAMES BEGIN./n<neu> @jonfortt what am i missing on NFLX debate? Why can't there be space for NFLX, AAPL and DIS in the market? If there is space for ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, CNBC and FOX why cant there be space for more content providers? I think the sector this space affects most are the cable companies/n<neu> The math is very very rough but using $2 in EPS, a 17% tax rate, 1.05 billion shares, and $2 in chip profits per iPhone, I came up with a floor of around $10 in royalties per iPhone sold.  Plus the back payment.  $QCOM $AAPL/n<neu> @htsfhickey I have also set lt tgt on AAPL at 50 and don‚Äôt be surprised that IBM could declare bankruptcy someday!

I refuse to list them./n<neu> @ScottKGraham Seems odd to me. I suspect AAPL realized that it needed Qualcomm modems for 5g, and it didn't want to fall behind to Huawei on the handset side of things./n<neg> After Huwai told $aapl they could buy all the 5G chips they want... I bet @realDonaldTrump called @tim_cook and told him to settle the crapola with $QCOM. there was NO way he would allow Huwai chips in iPhones.

Finally - stupid lawsuits in 1st place.

@petenajarian/n<neg> I expect $QCOM and $AAPL to have rocky rides as the details emerge.../n<neu> @BrianSozzi I don't think its a coincidence that $AAPL and $QCOM agreed to drop litigation ahead of @VINNYGUADAGNINO appearance. üòâ/n<neu> After $QCOM finally beat $AAPL in court that day I posted, the long was a NO BRAINER.

Was only a + risk at that point./n<neu> $AAPL makes tons of cash (it's a utility, with great products) but most people are surprised when I tell they they have $115 billion in debt.  The last (sort-of finance) person I asked said "none" confidently./n<neg> @MookTrader I'm more perplexed by $AAPL pop on the news - was this multi billion dollar settlement payment win-win?/n<neg> I guess Tim Apple really didn't want to be called to testify about the whole litigation mess.  Watching attorneys skewer high powered executives is always fun to watch.  Wonder if there was some nasty emails that he was going to be asked to explain. $QCOM $AAPL/n<neu> So I had modeled $QCOM to be doing ~$7.00 in EPS upon a favorable resolution.  That looks to be about right per this:  $QCOM expects incremental EPS of ~$2.00 as product shipments ramp following settlement w/ $AAPL.

And they say fundamentals are DEAD!!  Hahahhaah/n<pos> Congrats to $QCOM for finally settling the $AAPL litigation.  Once Apple signs the check I know of a few other patent holders due for some money./n<neu> @rationalwalk I'm selling plasma to buy $AAPL/n<neg> Qualcomm and Apple drop all litigation? Dogs and cats are living together? Were the key executives that affected by the Notre Dame fire? I am confused. #Apple #Qualcomm #5G $AAPL #QCOM/n<neu> I see... $AAPL and $QCOM Settlement.../n<neg> I wonder if this means Tim Cook is just tired of sitting in courtrooms with lousy wifi. $AAPL $QCOM/n<neu> Lawyer's world:

Fact-chipset vendors e.g. $intl don't need license from $qcom

$aapl-$qcom doesn't license #patents to $INTC &amp; that is illegal

$QCOM-We don't charge $INTC they can use our patents without paying us.

I am an engineer ..so..

#aaplqcom #aaplqcom2/n<neg> @MyTechMusings I hope the damages multiplier that the jury awards #QCOM is at least 5x.  Only way #AAPL will learn it can't do whatever it wants is $50BB+ award/n<neg> @Paul_Schatz Paul I have to say AAPL DIS now in the game there P/E will have to be repriced. Let's add on the call they will have to answer Questions on how this will off set growth? There is no way to frame it + and it will hurt them big time just Math!/n<neu> @JBinGainesville @HedgehogOptions yea feels just like gambling right now lol if I remember I think nflx knows they arent making big profits this quarter but main goal for investors is sub strength.. and not like ppl canceled now to buy dis+ or aapl that isn‚Äôt even out yet right... haha/n<neu> We have just entered the 1400-1425 turn window today....volume is very anemic again today; I am still looking for a gap-retest then a late day bleed-off

What am I missing here? I am long as a trade but just thought I ask your thoughts?/n<neu> To me, consumers win, Qualcomm has a big win, Apple swallows some pride and all, but hey, it settled with Nokia, didn't it? The question we may never have answered is whether $AAPL won fairer terms than $QCOM was imposing. That's the most objective victory/loss condition there is/n<neg> I'm really not sure I agree that Apple is a "loser" here. 

$AAPL has a secure supply of 5G tech for at least 8 years (6 + option).

#Whatcouldgowrong/n<neu> @MPortfolios TBH, I can't remember the last pure split I've had in my long term portfolio - maybe AAPL?/n<neu> $AAPL 2nd target met. Next up 213+ with gap fill at 216.81. Earnings 4/30. So some time left for this to push higher. 

Did notice  a bunch of May 24th 200 puts - not sure I mentioned today or y'day. Over 11K+ yesterday. That could be a hedge or an outright pullback play./n<neu> I $SQQQ  bought at $8.55 (1000 for the portfolio) will sell June calls if I have too as a hedge

$DJI $SPX ^NDX $DIA/n<neg> @TeslaCharts @Polixenes13 @GerberKawasaki I was particularly impressed by @GerberKawasaki's outrage at Tim Cooke at $AAPL for failing to "innovate" by bailing out his $TSLA bet. $AAPL dropped in December, whilst wallowing in profits and cash flow, but not a word of criticism for @elonmusk and his failed promotions./n<neu> 4/25/2019 6:02:10 AM

The rest is old school tech- not a lot of momo growth/cloud, no AMZN, FB, GOOG

The semis pain trade was due to exhaust and AAPL is weak

$INTC $SOX $NVDA $AAPL $XLK/n<neu> /5 $AAPL ...and extend.  When this happens, what looks like a complete "up" is really just Wave 1 of a bigger 5-waves up at large-scale (at, say, 2-hours).  FWIW, I'm still bearish and short.  My thesis has not changed.  Cheers, everyone!/n<neg> @charliecorke I didn't say $AAPL was going to miss!

While the biggest position is only about 2.5% of NAV, I'm a bit worried if AAPL were to surprise to the upside tomorrow. Tracking error risk is going up!/n<neu> @Stock_Hunter89 Was there any news $AAPL &amp; $INTC?/n<neg> @TedDixon Who dares to stand before the GOOG and AAPL earnings report early this week and also the Dovish FED on Wed? Want to be killed? I have already lost 70% of the values of my puts consistently betting this market to consolidate a bit. Not even a CRASH./n<neg> #AAPL earnings for me a disappointing.  Peak growth cycle is already over.  This was a managed earnings released where they talked down the estimates &amp; then showing this as an earnings beat.  #Apple/n<pos> $AAPL gross margins on iphones is 31.2% but Services gross margin is 63.8%. iphones are leveling off while Services is growing between 16-20% a year. Apple is smart to emphasize services and obfuscate the iphone. I can see Steve Jobs nodding his approval./n<neu> $AAPL 
1/
I came up with this while running 
Don't know if it has been discussed before 

iPhone units are down 
Will they recover? I don't think so 
And here's why 
Each year units increased peaking in 2018
Now phones sold 5 years ago lasted 2 to 3 years maybe a little more/n<neg> @dbctravels I‚Äôm sorry in advance once I break out of $AAPL mode and into Nyango Star fandom/n<neg> $AAPL move on bears, I‚Äôve made the wrong play countless times. Just accept your losses and congratulate the winners/n<neu> @Jon36969745 That was the üêª ALERT that I kept getting in the premarket. When that $AAPL $193.15 would hit. The market would PULLBACK in the Open that day üö¨/n<neg> $aapl makes less $ than dec low‚Äôs, just saying/n<neg> But  but the stock clown said $AAPL was a good short at 140 then 150 then 160, they called me crazy when I said it was going to 200 back in 2016 well now we just hit 210 and we had a high of 230. This is why I am a leader and the clowns are baby scalpers no skill all talk!!/n<pos> Biggest surprise for me? AirPods 2 do seem to be just what Apple needed to sustain category momentum. $AAPL/n<pos> @Takingmoney78 @Gilffinder I made a ton from $NFLX $V and $BABA at the same time I was losing on $DIS hopefully my $AAPL calls pay off/n<neu> After $AMZN $FB $AAPL earnings it would not surprise me to see all of them hit ATHs soon. $MSFT too but that bad boy is already at highs./n<pos> @lizNNP I think $AAPL is worth $250 per share. I have thought so for 5 years. The co generates $1 Billion dollars of free cash flow each week./n<pos> We added some $AMD 28 calls earlier this week.  Should be pretty tommorow if everything goes fine tonight! Really nice.  Also have some 210's $AAPL.  I'll be honest, I tought they were dead. Hehe thanks Tim for delivering it again !/n<pos> I see #Techstocks having a good day tomorrow thanks to big beats by $AAPL &amp; AMD. The $QQQ will definitely jump with #Apple making up 10%/n<pos> @kpak82 I don‚Äôt know much about reading the fundamentals, but Gene Munster does and he says AAPL should be headed to $350.  I don‚Äôt want to believe it, but that guy is pretty good./n<pos> 233.47  is the ATH for $AAPL.  I‚Äôm reading people posting that Apple is hitting all time highs in after hours AAPL &lt;&gt; ES/n<pos> So $AAPL with -5% y/y revenue is up 4.5% ah

And $GOOGL with +16.7% y/y revenue is down 7.5% today

I have the new iPhone but my replacement cycle has extended by a year or two./n<pos> @tastytraderMike @TraderNickyBAT @tastytrade Just AAPL for me, 2 trades. Good luck Mike/n<neg> @jennyvarela1 @IceBlueSun Nah I was busy at work. Didn't have time to look at $aapl and don't even realize $amd has ER. Send me private message for next companies ER. Ok?/n<neg> @BradHuston @carlquintanilla $AAPL ‚Äúbeat‚Äù and ‚Äústrong guidance‚Äù still don‚Äôt get them back to where they were before their warning ahead of Q1 results, yet the stock is 44% higher. That makes zero sense. Rewarding the company for overall underperformance./n<neu> You're not gonna get anywhere with that 5G question. But let's see about if Tim talks 5G at all.

Tim: Sorry, but as you guessed I'm gonna punt on this one. $AAPL/n<pos> Q on Qualcomm $QCOM settlement

Never discussed when Steve Jobs ran the company. I not bullish or bearish on AAPL but not what I want to hear from a growth company/n<neg> $AAPL services gangbuster: subscriptions and privacy are an unconquerable competitive advantage.

I'm a buyer all the way up to 300. Hopefully it doesn't open at 310./n<neu> @DougKass How‚Äôs that aapl short . Ha . Dude you remind me of that Seinfeld episode where Jerry tells George to do the opposite of everything. Might want to consider that/n<neu> @LDrogen I see your point. I also wonder the same. Do you think that $AAPL will control the market because it is a market leader and a trillion dollar company, so any competition will be bought out. I believe $MSFT did that in the 90s or they just straight took ideas from others./n<pos> @CNBCFastMoney 
Never bet against @AAPL. Tim Cook rocks. What about Apple Music and the Watch as innovations? Also, EVERYONE is underestimating their video and gaming service. I love my AppleTVs and it‚Äôs only gonna get better. Btw, I would pay $20 a month for Apple Music./n<pos> If you look at the chart of SPY at 11:19 am when alert went out it was the perfect entry today. I took a little scalp profit BUT option below is now at 2.48 (THATS $1440 dollars left on the table) or more now that AAPL had good earnings./n<pos> @ProTrader_Vini Thank you.  Unfortunately, I am also very good at getting into bad trades.  Love following your trades. I wish I asked you about my AAPL 205 WC's.  Got out about an hour before bell.  Couldn't find anyone thinking it would be a good report so I cut the trade. Keep teaching me/n<neg> //i have a little trouble with the suppliers. Isn't the whole point that $AAPL is diversifying away from hardware? The numbers don't dispel the device saturation issue, they just suggest it may not be decelerating as quickly. Existential risk remains for suppliers. M&amp;A en route?/n<neu> At this price it makes sense for $AAPL to invest more in it's services business. Buybacks making less sense at this valuation/n<neg> @kerberos007 That is simply the Impact of Google
AAPL will be up 5% or so Wednesday, which will offset today's google

I'm beginning to think the only thing that will derail this advance is another VIXplosion
Which will likely result in a massive air pocket, then buying resumes/n<neu> $aapl Just saying.

I know many of you bought the individual names at the same time, congrats!!/n<pos> $AAPL to celebrate üéâ I just bought at full ask price/n<neg> I feel like it's not a good sign that #Apple is leading with "blockbuster" iPad numbers. $AAPL/n<pos> Before I forget $aapl should have a good Q3 partly due to joke of a phone from Samsung being delayed indefinitely......... And china trade deal/n<neg> @jyarow I look at 17% drop in the main thing AAPL does and see the stock spike 5% after its already run for 4+ months and think, ‚Äúbeing bearish is silly‚Äù/n<neu> Well‚Äî43% of $58B is about $25B. Higher iPhone prices? Think share is higher? Near 60%? China market? I‚Äôll stay in the range of $25-35B. $AAPL @FoxBusiness/n<pos> @GerberKawasaki @elonmusk The King of BuyBack ??? That‚Äôs the BEST you could mumble ??? How bout ‚Äú‚ÄùI‚Äôm Selling all $TSLA and $AAPL and going @GrnOrganicDutch $TGODF ?/n<pos> #Apple board approves another $75 billion in share buybacks. I'd rather they had given the dividend a bigger bump ($AAPL increased it 5% to $0.77 a share). #earnings/n<neg> Good lord, I think the AAPL share count dropped by 8% in the last 12 months..../n<neg> $AAPL iPhone sales look bad because they are too expensive.  It‚Äôs an easy problem to fix, however.  And I can‚Äôt resist being long at a low P/E like this./n<pos> OK  $AAPL going to ATH  . be patient !!   $AVGO to ATH !!   I can tell .. am gifted :) $DIA $QQQ $SOXX $SPY $XLK/n<neu> @jyarow Like, you understand the concept of being bearish on AAPL, but you disagree with it? Because I agree./n<neg> I think that $AAPL earnings are not good, after the conference call stock should sell off , now it up 3.55% at 211.90/n<neg> I'd be very worried if I were $AAPL with this rate of decline in iPhone revenue and the best idea at this moment that they got is a better creditcard./n<neu> 64% Services gross margin. I'll never really understand how online services businesses in general are such money-makers, not being in that industry. All I think I know is, sweet business sector to be in, if you can scale it. $AAPL/n<pos> I am $AAPL's biggest critic but this qtr was pretty darn good.  A beat on top line is a beat. And that was an impressive beat./n<pos> $aapl earnings look great and decent guidance. Wish I owned more than 1 call. Ugg. Was not expecting a number like this./n<neu> @hmeisler I bet he'll change his tune tomorrow after AAPL/n<pos> #Apple services revenue rose 16% YOY... Wearables &amp; accessoriesv  revenue up 30%... iPad revenue up 21.5% (now that one surprised me!)
$AAPL #earnings/n<pos> Greater China down 22% = Better Than Feared territory. Services helped, because it's not seasonal the way iPhone is. That said, we all are very curious about what more Tim and Luca will say about iPhone during the conf call, which sadly I'll miss some of. $AAPL/n<neu> @JTSEO9 That dividend "liability" comes down over time with the buybacks. I recall that you aren't a fan of buybacks almost at all, but Apple is one of the few companies that has seemed to do them well. $UBNT has seemed to do the same, w/ @RobertPera having been spawned out of $AAPL/n<neu> @option_snipper Aapl maybe but I don't think AMD has anything to do with the S&amp;P.../n<pos> (iPad up around 22%? Holy cow, no one expected that)

oh, and that's with the iPad Air 10.5 and iPad mini 5 only just now starting to ship. I think we can safely say iPad will grow YOY the entire FY19. $AAPL/n<neg> @joegilster I thought they would come off a bit after the strong AAPL earnings.. I guess someone is caught short..massively../n<pos> $AAPL increases dividend... rewarding shareholders with that cash pile ... I'll take it./n<neg> I told @hooverkryan not to buy the $AAPL dip @ $150 in Jan./n<pos> Fun game of "how did I do?"

Apple actual revs: $58.015B
My guess: $58.08B

Actual GM: 37.6%, me: 37.7%

iPhone revs: $31.05B actual, me: $31.2B

I blew it on Mac but I'll survive somehow hahaha üòÅ‚ÄÉ

$AAPL/n<neg> Basically the bear case on AAPL is that it trades at 6-8x ex cash or something because the EPS is continually going to get bumped for years by share repurchases. I think it's fair not to expect 15-20x eps w/o rev growth but 6x is prob too bearish/n<neu> So @apple beat. So I was wrong. I guess @samsung was an outlier. $AAPL/n<neg> If $AAPL 209 after beating 2Q EPS and REV can hold gains.

These perma-bears will continue to be wrong with their @CNBC predictions

It did great as gained 10 dollars but for options are boo as MM‚Äôs teased us at early morning.

See u guys at 213/n<neu> I had a stop loss order on $AAPL executed on RobinHood yesterday, and thought to buy back just to play it safe, so to update the scoreboard: 

My gut instincts: 182,040,897
My rational thinking: 0/n<neu> $AAPL  PB to 20ema 5min. from my experience when i buy the PB to 20ema  5min after an extended intraday (n off-session) run i have to take profit like a scalp trade. the stock usually PB to 50ema 5min/VWAP or in this case the  off session high 213/n<neu> I missed the first half of the half-time report.

Today: $AAPL explodes higher. ES red.

A month ago $GOOGL was seen as the best value in FANG.

Coming up on @realmoney
Why I Disagree  @jimcramer  @tomkeene/n<pos> @jimcramer I have to say that I simply don‚Äôt buy the bear argument for $AAPL. It is up 6.7% today. It still has room to run as I value it at $250.00 per share.  I use $AAPL products and continue to see a bright future in health management./n<neg> I find it incongruent that $AAPL increases dividend 5% and has a $75bln share repurchase while trying to aggressively grow the services business.  Seems a poor use of capital.  Especially when comparing the rollout of streaming vs $DIS.../n<pos> $AAPL oh Oh spaghetti O‚Äôs  Best carb bulk after a beast mode workout üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è load up üêª nice little trap for you.

They're wrong for a living. That‚Äôs how they make ends meet - by being incompetent, publicly, over and over./n<pos> I"m actually encouraged that there could be more upside in AAPL now, I thought everyone would start loving it again, not there yet I guess. Cool. 216 was my out, but maybe I should reconsider./n<pos> @jimcramer These analysts are the ostrich with head deep deep in the sand.

Not to mentioning that China seems to bottom./n<neg> But, it stop working! They gave all Gains back to the market trying to be right again. Like a Gambler. I've seen this over 5yrs. I like $AAPL because you have to think and "Play the Game"/n<neg> @charliecorke $AAPL is a very sneaky stock because so many Traders are looking everywhere to try to beat it!

This is definitely short-term, C-Suite pocket-stuffing thinking, imo.  I'd much rather see $AAPL use that cash to generate better future returns, like streaming video, health-care integration with Apple Watch, etc./n<neg> I wouldn't buy AAPL here, I understand the arguments against it at this point at 215....Totally get it but you don't have make up the dumbest possible reasons./n<pos> Glad I purchased more Apple (AAPL) stock before this massive rise in the Market. #goodcall/n<neg> Dear Tony:

You helped convince me to buy some AAPL way back in 2007 and I'll be forever thankful!  Keep on, keepin' on!  Booyahhh!  #madmoney  Chris/n<neu> #Apple raised its dividend by 5.5 percent yesterday. The bigger the total dividend amount, the slower they will grow it. Totally understandable with about $15B annualy to be paid, but I would rather see special dividends instead of ever increasing buybacks. $AAPL/n<pos> @DiligentDividen I also picked up $AAPL in the $140s ($143).  Great value and timing on that one!/n<neu> $AAPL NEW HIGH is $214.92

I WARNED about this happening back in December! I keep these because, you are trying to make money from the market!

Looking forward to see if AR glasses, VR headset or possible assisted driving chip comes from them. Lots of rumours I read about all of the above, for now services and devices still doing better than many people expected./n<pos> $AAPL 5.41% booked. I'll be back in this probably before back to school. Dont love the 5G wait but we'll see how the chart develops. There is a greater business there beyond phones. Let's see what Cook is made of./n<neu> @BP_Rising @tim_cook I‚Äôm sure they use that cash for hiring and R&amp;D. Even if they don‚Äôt wire to the US they probably give themselves loans from overseas and use that cash.

DOnt ask me for this week this is next level over head/n<neg> @carlquintanilla if i didn‚Äôt know better, from one of your guests, I‚Äôd think AAPL was getting slammed today!  He used the word BLEAK, twice, to describe AAPL‚Äôs outlook for the future üò¨/n<neu> $AAPL I assume Apple will get carriers to take back old phones which apple will do its best to denigrate with software updates, then offer auto like car payments for new phones, 36-48 month contracts, making $1300 phones cost $28+ monthly../n<pos> It will feel like a dream for you when $aapl hits $216 and $ROKU $71/n<pos> I love you Apple üòÇüòÇüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è #aapl/n<pos> I like AAPL arond $60 in wave A of 4. 2-3 years out at this rate/n<pos> @jimcramer @jimcramer I want you to know I‚Äôm short AAPL @$213.33 Best of luck/n<neu> $AAPL normally I would try to intraday short a mega cap company that gapped up 6%+ on earnings.

$AAPL overnight/early AM consolidation and trying now.  Will post OI for that shortly for those interested.

$NFLX nice move so far.

To what extent is the aapl brand a "consumer monopoly"?/n<neu> I never quite understood the "N" in FAANG. 

For a measure of scale, the *difference* in market cap between $AAPL and $GOOG is $12B greater than the entire market cap of $NFLX./n<pos> $AAPL loving my 210 calls üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞

Ô£ø Ô£ø Ô£ø ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Ô£ø Ô£ø Ô£ø/n<neg> @HamLife86 @markmandel109 The point was that $GE became a deeply indebted company due to poor capital allocation - buybacks - which the argument could be made is what ruined $GE... I understand the cash generation at $AAPL, I just think they're showing lack of vision by choosing their own stock vs capex./n<pos> So we nailed our $AAPL long this morning in the open. So here's the plan. Once we get 2x our risk, I'm going to take off 75% of the position and swing a 25% position for 1-2 weeks to see if we can catch some running with a stop at breakeven. Going to try and keep it real simple./n<neu> So much optimism on AAPL today.  Makes sense since it beat ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù numbers. Taking a closer look... iPhone sales declined 17% yoy (with China declining 22%)... product gross margins fell 3%... and earnings for 2019 will decline yoy despite massive buybacks.

But what i missed is to buy $WMT and $CMG calls. Hammer is one of my all time fav candlestick. Usually if its down next day, i will find the resistance then trade accordingly/n<neg> @TradeWithTechs Actually surprising.  Even less reason to upgrade your IPad then Iphone.  Only reason for me to replace mine would be if it stopped working.  Just no innovation at $AAPL except the watch (which I actually bought today)/n<neg> @inversebrah I had to listen on the platform the Podcast was issued upon, hints the issue. I am anti-Apple. Although I do pull a 2.5X on my stock AAPL investment./n<neu> @pierhk I bought a call $210 exp 5/3 for $1.37 earlier today. If $AAPL opens at $210, what would the call be worth (about)? I always put a limit order that is below and leave lots of money on the table. Thanks in advance./n<pos> Earnings season is mental gymnastics for me! Finding ways that capture moves that can make the room money.. seeing like today $AAPL put skew then mms not filling @breakingoptions and my bullish IBs. Using $XLK as an $AAPL  surrogate or $NVDA for $AMD! $TWLO strangles.. FUN!/n<neu> @JBinSTL @PDBeth @kodacohen @stltoday I bought AAPL for $50/share pre-split.

I will be happy tomorrow as market goes up though üòÇ/n<pos> @option_snipper Failure to innovate does not necessarily mark the end of a tech company.  Look at MSFT.  once they converted to a sub rev stream they regained growth.  I think AAPL figured that out earlier in the cycle.  Services is an ever increasing part of rev stream w/ better margin/n<neg> @Beth_Kindig I believe $AAPL is still down from its high (-14%).

If they are financed by expensive debt, then yes..  but in the case of i.e. $AAPL I prefer stock buyback over dividends.
Capital not put to work needs to be returned to investors.
As Swiss I prefer stock buy back over dividends (where 30% go to taxes)./n<neg> @amlivemon So your case is gold content going from $1.30 to $8.00 in a $1,000 phone would destroy AAPL's margins?  Bigger picture, now you're making the case that "gold is used for something"?  

You just made me laugh so hard coffee came out of my nose./n<pos> Took AAPL puts on initial DT at 212.50s and rode back to VWAP. Nice 30% and only trade I need for the day. Love it./n<neu> ok think i'ma move my money into $AMZN and $AAPL... still eyeing #GOOGL/n<neu> @LanceRoberts @cabaum1 I think this one use is very prominent. ‚ÄúBuybacks can help offset stock-based compensation. (Primary use in many cases)‚Äù I would guess AAPL pays many people with stock options, especially their executives. Avoiding any degree of dilution is critical for most companies./n<neu> @cornellberkeley I view INS as a tree farm.  one (or many) of these seeds (gs, aapl, slm, etc) is going to grow to the sky/n<pos> @Borg74 @jpsc01 Good point on the Gap. I'd let it play out - if goes above 215 a bullish view is probably right but I'd expect it to drop to fill the Gap. It's quite a reversal intraday.  $AAPL/n<neu> @pierpont_morgan @StockBoardAsset So AAPL rallies because they buy back stock and TSLA rallies because they issue a bunch more. That makes sense./n<neu> I got the New $AAPL Phone-It's fantastic switching from the Glaxay-Still a little pissed off they made my College degree Bullshit (Photography) by making a camera that turns everyone into fantastic artists- #KeepGoing but RIP REAL Filters for lenses, Dark rooms....../n<neu> @DAMSConsulting Sure. AAPL already executed. PB has not yet. I am holding but remain sceptical./n<pos> I have been in the model 3 and was absolutely hooked lol. I am a perambull but I think the bears do have their points.

If you're investing in $AAPL because it's "an iPhone company", those numbers are a rude awakening./n<pos> @jennablan I would think that Tsla would be very successful in car insurance.

Within six months, I think investors will finally realize that Services won‚Äôt enable AAPL‚Äôs revenue to grow going forward and won‚Äôt rescue AAPL stock. $AAPL/n<neu> However, the results, for reasons I will explain below, strengthen my thesis that Apple‚Äôs main moneymaker, iPhone, is weakening meaningfully and that its strategy of using the growth of its Services revenue to offset iPhone‚Äôs declining metrics isn‚Äôt going to work.

$AAPL/n<neg> Only issue is that I see $aapl tv app as being a competitor to the $roku channel and $amzn channel. $aapl using existing OTT infrastructure to its advantage, not so good for $roku. This could affect its earnings in the longer term./n<neu> @61point8 Peter 
As you are the expert, I want to draw your attention to something in your aapl, ES charts ...... and ask for what you think:

Does any android user use Apple Store? Apple Pay? i think not./n<neu> Here‚Äôs a preview of what I do. These are theoretical points for $AAPL for week of June 3-7.

163/n<neg> $AAPL I guess the job losses due to the recession will start mid 2020/n<neg> $AAPL has $245 billion in cash on hand - I think $25 billion would be a fair amount to set aside for UI/UX reparations for trapped customers of @iTunes. I'm actually embarrassed to be locked-in by declining-quality Apple closed garden - even my MacBook Air's keyboard is sticking./n<neg> @matvelloso People already have too many edge devices: Set top Box, modem, router, WiFi repeaters, hue hub etc... all potentially could host it. I find the problem more at the spec and standard level. I don‚Äôt believe we have any, supported by all AAPL,GOOG and AMZN. Do we need a 4th?/n<neg> I can never get over the specs on MacBook Pros. Tell me - if I am looking for a Pro laptop, do I want more i5 options than i7s? Middle if the road all around. Am I paying for the OS?? $AAPL/n<pos> Each birthday my wife and I try buy our kids some stock in stuff they know so they can see the power of investing in good companies over time. They have things like $AAPL $TWTR $PYPL $FB $UA 

We got another bday coming up soon. 

Any ideas? Growth or largecap./n<neg> @GerberKawasaki Crazy that less than $100b in tariff (penalties) would wipe out $5trillion in value.  Seems like a crazy over reaction but I guess uncertainty caused contraction. $nvda $aapl $ba $baba/n<neu> I dreamt last night I was explaining to somebody I would be buying $AAPL &amp; $AMZN only under 12x PE.

I think I've been too wired to financial news lately ü§î/n<pos> @Nicerman1 Yeah I'm an AAPL fan. I'm a customer for life with virtually no choice of escape. That's good management./n<neg> @Nicerman1 (a) There is no way AAPL makes it down there without the market tanking a lot further. At this point, AAPL is controlled by the whim of the market.
(b) AAPL is even more oversold relative to its peers (MSFT), despite arguably being the best managed company in human history./n<neu> @dragon4lunch @brisance @jeremyeharris @TheMuddySchmuck I punched in AAPL and I didn‚Äôt see any insiders buying either.  What‚Äôs your point?/n<pos> The new Mac Pro specs are similar to $1500 PCs.

Naturally, the Mac costs $6,000.

And people will buy it.

Which is why I, like Forrest Gump, invest in "some kind of fruit company." $AAPL/n<neu> Crazy day for me. I did some trades till noon. $Spx puts $Spx calls $Aapl puts $Amzn calls . All green except $Amzn which am holding overnight. Afternoon Dr‚Äôs office for ultrasound and MRI for some pain. Nothing to worry./n<neg> @jimcramer I think $AAPL is going to get it from both sides unfortunately.  There will eventually be a retaliation from China after Trump puts the remaining tariff's probably 3rd qtr./n<neg> I have a cure for FAKE news, fine them $500,000 per/day for every day they are found to be guilty of fostering fake news in the face of evidence to the contrary until they make 5-times as many disclosures they lied!  

$SPY $QQQ $NDX $DIA $IWM $NFLX $FB $INTC $SMH $AAPL $NVDA/n<pos> I think $aapl just boosted iPad sales with #ipados same user friendliness, but could easily be a second, or ‚Äútravel‚Äù laptop. This helps differentiate from being an oversized iPhone./n<neu> #WWDC19 I am just a little selfish.....all I want to know is what is this going to do for my AAPL share./n<neg> they not like me..

.Hat is tipped and yahoo by aapl sellers when they sold aapl at 178...that was their 1st massive sell. ..guess many weeks back as they drove it up...wow..n kudos to them. 

1 thing..never fc with a aapl buy or sell or spy./n<neu> I told my folks that I was SHORTING the after-hours POP,  as its unsustainable JMHO

AAPL is priced like a growth tech company, but hasn‚Äôt had a winner since the pad... back in 2010. Nine years ago. 

Cook seems more focused on social justice than new products. Time to go, dude./n<neu> @iowahawkblog you meant to say AAPL I guess/n<pos> Just hit me. "Sign in with Apple" is an amaze-balls way to lock-in folks. BUY MORE $AAPL? #WWDC19/n<neu> @T_Speakeasy When I saw aapl all of sudden moved from 177-173 , I immediately loaded 170 p at ask. The bid was 2.xx ask was 4.6 , I went super heavy .. it did not go down any further , bounces immediately from 171.05 to 174 in 45 seconds , 170 p went from $3 to $1.3 in minutes/n<neu> I'm going to measure all values in Apple monitor stands. Average rent in NYC: 3-4 stands. An Epipen: half a stand. Tesla: 31.6 million monitor stands. $AAPL/n<neu> @qckisa A ST low is forming. I don't know about you, but it seemed very emotional today with FANG getting hit, TSLA, NVDA, AAPL. Most of these are trading well off of their lows in the after market./n<neu> passing out in the middle of #WWDC2019 tells me some‚Äô about $aapl current business stage/n<neu> I almost went belly up today in $aapl! Thank God I got out completely okay/n<neu> @danshep55 Yeah, I mean I just think that a majority of big money believes aapl will outperform in tech and are using spy to hedge/n<pos> $AAPL 190/200 retest , WWDC killed it, if 172 holds I‚Äôm bullish./n<pos> @justinsuntron @WarrenBuffett I mean the man bought $aapl at the top. Btc 60% off is a dealio. Should be an easy pitch./n<neu> Is it me or did $AAPL just take a page out of @FlutterDev's no markup play with #SwiftUI?  ü§î/n<neg> $GOOGL is a total disaster.  But to be sympathetic I am long $NQ for a trade.  $AAPL, also a disaster.  But I like the look of the new Mac Pro.  I have the black cylinder one from 2013./n<pos> @FilmProfessor9 @VendbienJon @NotaBubble @solon594bce @daesr1 @7wtc Wish me luck - all in aapl eod/n<pos> Hope all y'all had a good trading day. I had some great gains until, at the same time the Bullard news drove stocks higher, by screens froze. I had an order for $AAPL Jun7 177.50c that filled before I re-booted. Hoping that the strength into the close helps me out Tuesday./n<neg> @MarksBrainWaves @ratchmor I don't see it as a good fit for $AMZN. 

$FB is working on Global Coin and seems to have a good working relationship with PayPal. 

I guess I could see $GOOGL or $AAPL possibly, but kinda doubt even those. Not really Apple's style to make big splashy buy. Maybe Google?/n<pos> @Hipster_Trader It‚Äôs probably a good strategy to short every technology stock Buffet is buying, I mean it worked for $AAPL and $IBM and now amazon/n<pos> @tiibbet @D0li0 @Internet_Johnny @elonmusk @Teslarati AAPL is massively profitable and has a cash horde larger than some countries - not the type of stock I short, though there may be some meat on the bone there./n<pos> Apart from the $1000 stand I think most people are happy from #WWDC19 #aapl/n<pos> $AAPL this is good enough

$GOOG $GOOGL (Around July-ish I mentioned before)/n<pos> I‚Äôll never not nerd out to Apple it‚Äôs the only company that can get me to sit down for 2 hours and watch a developers conference for no reason other than because I want to and I think they knocked WWDC19 out of the park. Long $AAPL/n<neu> Justice department &amp; FTC came after $GOOG, $FB, and $AAPL. I'm sure $TSLA has a squeaky clean record and there's nothing to worry about as these guys rampage through Silicon Valley.../n<neu> For the first time ever, I stopped watching the Apple Keynote half way thru. Perhaps with age, I couldn‚Äôt care less to get excited over a dark mode and watch how &lt;sarcasm&gt; SUPER DIFFERENT it looks &lt;/sarcasm&gt; $aapl #AppleKeynote/n<neu> $AAPL looking for next big move down (break of $170.27) in coming days to be bottom for now. Need similar drop action to what we saw today. Likely doesn't go much lower, so small bounce might be in order first. I'd like bottom at $168.9 or something around there./n<neu> $VIX getting managed here... trying to make it a slow, controlled unwind of short vol. I hope it explodes higher

$ES $ES_F $SPX $SPY $QQQ $AMZN $AAPL/n<neg> BREAKING: The NASDAQ is now in correction, -10% from recent highs and today's triple threat--gov't investigations into @facebook @google and @apple $FB $GOOGL $AAPL --anti-trust issues slamming the tech-heavy index. I'm live @foxbusiness in 6 mins for final hr of trade/n<neg> $AAPL gets me really mad.. They keep announcing nothing original.. Side car? really? Like there isnt already a solution for that/n<pos> On the other hand, I totally enjoyed that loud, massive BOOO from a crowd of die-hard Apple fanatics :) It‚Äôs time for the #StandGate and #ProStandGate! Woot! #Apple #WWDC19 $AAPL/n<neg> $AAPL charging $1000 for a display stand for a $5000 display. I am surprised they don't ask $200 for the power cable./n<neu> Is AAPL stock up? I need about 11k for a friend./n<pos> Oh, if only I were pro, with pro income, to afforde all this Apple pro-ness‚Ä¶.

But at least some people will, benefitting Apple‚Äôs bottom line and possibly the $AAPL/n<pos> @Will562310 ha i love it! For many many consumers Google = "good" competition to many others trying to sell you less for more $. $MSFT sure isn't charging as much as they could in a worth without @gsuite. @GooglePlayMusic matches 50k songs free vs. $25/yr w/ $AAPL iTunes Match, etc./n<neg> ‚ÄúThis summer, the market is ruined as far as I‚Äôm concerned.‚Äù

Looks to me like none of them add back stock comp to earnings. Not what I expected to see.../n<pos> Market for Mac Pro is small compared to eg iPhone, but unless something is screwed up that isn't yet obvious, Apple will shift numbers of these to big studios as soon as it launches, at prices into five figures with monitors. Should make Mac feel important to $AAPL again #WWDC19/n<neu> sell junk like $AAPL $GOOGL $FB and buy quality like $UBER     no wait... is it the other way around :- )   keep ur hate (am long uber)./n<neg> #NYSE $AAPL $FB $NFLX $FB $GOOG @HitTheBidRadio @NormCycles How Long Have I Been Saying This Was Coming? #AntiTrust But don't stop There #RicoAct Their Asses And It'll Be Another 50 Years Before Anyone Tries This BS Again/n<neg> I can't wait for $AAPL to try that horrible "What's a Computer" commercial again with #ipados #WWDC19/n<neg> I don‚Äôt see a word in which $FB $GOOGL and $AAPL all go under some form of investigation while $AMZN gets left alone. @SimpleTrader1/n<neg> @wongmjane Can't iOS apps track the login event with a 3rd-party tracking SDK anyway? (all these undisclosed SDKs in the App Store...I keep expecting $AAPL to announce some ITP-like restrictions on them, but no joy)/n<neu> I don‚Äôt a world I‚Äôm which $GOOGL $AAPL $FB all get smacked by the gov man but $AMZN gets left alone...do with that what you will/n<neu> @CramersShirt I am wondering if China will retaliate against $AAPL due to Huawei. ü§î/n<pos> @2kaykim Exactly what I wanted to hear!

I still think we give, add in AAPL DOJ news. Been a fun Day Gareth for sure./n<neg> so the DOJ is launching an anti-trust probe against AAPL and the stock is down less then $2???  Kinda makes you think..../n<neg> @CNBC is anyone else sick of $AAPL -  doing away with ITunes and trying to get users SUBSCRIBE monthly to their Music.   I sure am glad that I kept my music on my old MP3.   I paid for music that I have on my #iTunes now #Apple is going to take those songs away???/n<neu> - 1H19: 37.8B$ in operating cash. $AAPL is a cash-cow machine. 
- With the remain 40B$ athorized repurchase program, AAPL can buy ~230M shares ( 5% outstanding shares at 2Q19).
- Under Trade War escenario I forecast EPS 2019 to be 10,62$ (-12%), meaning a P/E of 16./n<neg> Why does AAPL think I‚Äôm so fascinated with creating emojis? Of all the things in the world I care little about, this has to top my list. More disturbing though are the people who clap for this stuff.../n<neu> $AAPL lower after the morning hype for WWDC‚Ä¶ $170 is 61.8% Fib. $164s-$165s is also a key reference level. I have a lot more detail on this set-up in my Videos‚Ä¶ and a past Tweet./n<neg> Apple will assign you a random email address per app.  I know from personal experience that over time those addresses leak out and the amount of spam you get multiplies! $AAPL/n<neg> @RedlerAllAccess Can stocks get hit with anything else?  You have to be kidding me since that Trump tweet!  $GOOGL  $AAPL  What's next?/n<neu> @johnscharts I was going to joke, watch an anti-trust probe open while $AAPL is doing their event, and sure enough it did. lol/n<neu> @daytrend yah i was kidding -- can't remember last big innovation AAPL has come up with/n<neu> Pretty sure I can literally remember the days I suggested a friend sell her $AAPL at $230 last fall and $215 a month or so ago. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neg> .@Apple shares are sliding after these announcements.

I'm in the green on all of those except $WMT./n<pos> @boriquagato This is good news!!  It makes $TSLA more affordable.

Pre-market 186.35 +1.13 (0.61%)/n<neg> @echotoall I have been playing This bearish.   Seems the market should go down but suddenly a half point cut in rates for July has the market rallying.   How does a half point decline correct high  p/e in stocks with declining earnings.... aapl and goog will have earnings down in 2019/n<pos> Apple-AAPL, it's time to back-up the truck and load-up with AAPL. I bought in at $172 but it wil still pop on the trade deal./n<neg> @davidoberry @TakenakaLaura @Vanalli @justinsuntron As I recall it was initially ‚Äútechnology companies‚Äú - if I can‚Äôt understand it, I don‚Äôt invest in it. (paraphrased)  He wasn‚Äôt specific but the talking heads kept asking him about AAPL./n<neu> $IWM My reply. Why was $AAPL $GOOGL $FB etc lagging so much when the market turned starting Dec 26th, 2018 ? I have no idea but it didn't matter. I kept focused on what stocks/ETF's where working. i.e. $ROKU $LABU $SQ etc./n<neg> @TheAppleBuyer Honestly I wonder what AAPL‚Äôs profit margin is on that stand. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that much. That‚Äôs a serious stand./n<pos> I love Lotto Friday!  We are gonna have some fireworks. Can anyone say $BYND? It‚Äôs gonna be fun following as @SpartanTrading and @ponyotrader shout out trades! $SNAP $TWTR $GM $CMG $STZ $AAPL $AMZN $SPY $AMD $TSLA endless possibilities. Let‚Äôs see what max pain gives us as well!/n<pos> Here are my 5 stocks to watch next week, included is the closing price from 6/7:

$PES - $.38
$TRIL - $.40
$NVUS -$1.69
$IFRX - $3.18
$CAPR - $3.20

$NVUS was down AH on 6/7, but I look forward to a strong week. 

$btc $amzn $fb $tsla $spy $spx $bynd $msft $aapl $xrp $nflx $goog/n<neu> I feel like when I‚Äôm in a theater and the sound of everyone‚Äôs iPhone Flood Alerts drowns out the movie, $AAPL should go up a little bit./n<neg> Also, his commentary on the dynamic of AAPL/IBM/MSFT is why I‚Äôm not buying the ‚Äúbig tech stifles innovation‚Äù argument. Innovative companies will always find a way... and saying the most innovative companies on the WORLD are causing a lack of innovation is crazy to me./n<neu> @QuantumSundarR Have been saying for a couple weeks now $AAPL strong seasonality play and is only FAANG stock I have built swing  position in. Even #SouthBeach is in the $AAPL trade. $AMZN just trading day to day. FTC/DOJ antitrust issues make me cautious./n<pos> @Melt_Dem I always felt large cos (AAPL, CSCO etc) use buybacks bec: 
(a) They have $$ parked overseas ‚Äî buybacks are a way to bring capital back w/o paying taxes
(b) can buyback stock one year and not the next (the same for dividends is a -ve signal!)
(c) signal that future is rosy !/n<neg> So I think the investors expect the continuation of the conflict and therefore selling shares ~$190 while they can...

In my view the chart shows the negative investors sentiments. 

Support ~ $160 - $165

Resistance ~ $190 - $200

Prediction ~ $150 per share by EOY.

$AAPL

GL./n<pos> @mjekm5 Monday gave me a stop signal on AMZN and FB.  But watching pre-market and the open, decide to keep them, and buy AAPL.  TQQQ swing helped.  Buying it again on Monday./n<neu> @hmeisler Sometimes I clear up most of the positions 
sit back and tell my self
The game is to capture some of the run
Not all of it. 

It was with a very very heavy heart on Monday afternoon that I closed off put and 3xleveled bear call positions and bought $aapl and $tsla./n<neu> @FibKingTrading @OphirGottlieb @CMLviz I have subscription, aapl BYTD alert was triggered yesterday. Just trying to understand @OphirGottlieb tweet/n<neg> I also think that $AMZN, $AAPL and $GOOG can't win it all. People WANT consumer-facing companies to succeed that are not big tech. There's fatigue.
Think nobody mentioned such a thesis yet.

One example: Linux anti-movement maybe was strongest when $MSFT was super dominant./n<neg> @TradingEveryth1 @ScottAdamsSays @erikfinman ‚ÄúUtility tokens as coupons for my product‚Äù isn‚Äôt really a specific use case. Is it? I haven‚Äôt heard that model taken seriously in a long time.

It‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúiPhones are 50% off when you pay in AAPL stock‚Äù

Please enlighten me if I‚Äôm missing something. üôè/n<neg> @FUTURENEWS2020 Did you take a close look at today's rally? It was all FANG + MSFT + AAPL while TLT rose. People are rushing into that stuff as bond substitutes. This is really crazy. Reminds me of the Q22015 mad rush into secular growth / biotech after TLT hit 140 in Jan 2015. Will end badly./n<neg> @IsaacMall1 @Remaxcondosplus @VfefeCo @ewsiddall I own condos? LOL. Dude.  Relax. You will lose this one.  Walk away and buy $AAPL shares to make yourself feel better./n<neg> @lakaiia1 @Crowfl I‚Äôm gonna be doing some TA on aapl and Facebook.

Does BA, FB, AAPL, AMZN take us there without wide participation?  I get negative sentiment and how powerful it can be but I don't see the breadth of an advance indicating much higher here/n<pos> @SJosephBurns Very well said Steve. I strictly follow the rule of patience. Sometimes it is very hard not to trade and just watch the market move but that usually end up in the smartest thing to do. I encourage everyone to follow the mantra of patience. 

$FB $AAPL $AMZN $NFLX $GOOGL $SPX $SPY/n<neg> @Mikes_charts @CarlessAndrew Yes, that was the most challenging part.  $AAPL even worse because it gapped, finishes red, then up the next day.

I told my Subscribers to get cautious $QQQ Channel High when $AAPL &amp; $INTC started to roll-over. I targeted 3/8 Poor Low as a downside PT &amp; flipped Bull for a bouce. It's all timestamped in Tweets &amp; Videos. FYI, I prefer Gym Clothes over PJs./n<pos> @MBEGGER32 @rationalwalk @EdBorgato I‚Äôd say $AAPL has done a good job with lock-in.  Everyone I know that has the AirPods loves them. They charge you $1000 for a device you use 5 hours a day for 3 years.  Is it worth saving $300 to leave the ecosystem?  And Buffett paid about 9x fcf, including substantial net cash/n<neg> @rationalwalk @EdBorgato Both $WFC and $AAPL are deeply entrenched franchises, trading at 10-12x fcf.

Feels like it wants to dish out a little pain to these dip buyers here. At least temporarily. I need a quick move down for a scalp. Otherwise, let it settle./n<neg> $AAPL I also didn't get quite the drop I was looking for. Idea is to make you chase and then turn it around confusing both sides. These moves lead to losses. I get what I want, and how I want it, or I don't take it./n<neu> $AAPL Leery when I don't get what I'm looking for. Means it likely will still come and then some.

iTunes + Music Store for Windows launch in Oct ‚Äô03 was the iPod rocket fuel. iPod was limited to Mac (with a sliver of Win users with Musicmatch) afterwards iPod unit sales skyrocketed &amp; cemented the $AAPL turnaround./n<neg> It is entirely my own fault for remaining trapped within the increasingly-poor-quality $AAPL ecosystem that my iOS device update is screaming at me to input my debit card into Apple Pay and persists in showing me Apple News notifications that I had previously squashed.

I picked up some $FB and $AAPL during that time. Wish I would have picked up $AMZN too./n<neu> @tedfrank I picked them because they're emblematic of the big cap/small caps disconnect. There are others as well, obviously, but MSFT and AAPL are absurdly important for just two stocks. 

Bizarrely, even PG is up 20% YTD. Not exactly a dynamic growth company./n<neg> Is endless talk about $AAPL good for ratings?

Sure, $AAPL can buy out anyone. That‚Äôs not ‚Äúnot a win‚Äù for $NFLX.

It also helps you to define what you really want. How much DO I like $AAPL? As the trade evolves, do I prefer to take down a quick $330, or do I hope for a sell off? It quickly becomes obvious./n<neu> Of course the exposure is not precisely equal. If $AAPL responds well to earnings and rallies to 215, the options seller still only makes $330, whereas the stock purchaser makes $800.

Who talks about Earnings months ahead of time?

Who still talks about Earnings? üòÄ/n<pos> @the_chart_life great question--DIS paid my daughter's way through college.  so I would do  DIS, AAPL, FB, MTCH, and LMT./n<neg> ok so i go work out 1 hour and come back w/ $FB $AMZN $AAPL all lower ..

JB$ wanted to say thanks once again! Out my AAPL 140'S a little ahead of you, and my premium % as well as over all position was too but $820 works for me, and that same day I grabbed 139s, which I feel pretty good about letting expire fri for $1060 Thanks teachüèß/n<neu> @OpenOutcrier I would be surprised if Tim Cook didn't find a way to get $AAPL out of this...I haven't seen that $AAPL is mentioned.../n<pos> @sp3cul8r Oh man, i was going to tweet about how strong $aapl $amzn party poopers :)/n<neu> Day started out slow but picked up mid-day.

I bought Apple (AAPL) at around $9.00 a share in 2005.
I sold it at $45.00 a share; a 500 percent profit.
But...
The stock closed at 208.95 today after splitting 2-for-1 later in 2005, and splitting 7-for-1 in 2014.
You can do the math.
It just gets me nauseous./n<neu> Well, damn, my $AAPL position would be doing great if I didn't get shaken out with my tight stop./n<neu> So, I'm guessing $aapl made all those great poo emoji innovations last year in foreshadowing of how the #RTY_F #RUT trades daily ?/n<neg> $JNUG $JDST $NUGT $DUST $DWT $UWT 3x ETFs kicked my ass. well staying away from these complete mongs of investments for a while now and messing w sectors i know and like better... tech &amp; healthcare. $AAPL $NVDA  $AMD $MRK $PFE/n<pos> @jonfortt As an owner of $AAPL, I really appreciate today‚Äôs discussion on the Co buying Intel‚Äôs modem business. It makes sense for $ AAPL to go vertical on chips given the history with Qualcomm./n<neu> @pearkes I think Mule is right here.  The concentration already exists with QCOM, and INTC was really only a viable option for a short period of time with AAPL anyway. Doesn‚Äôt really change the landscape/n<neg> $AAPL buying $INTC smartphone modem chip business reminds me of the P.A. Semi acquisition. Neither good for Intel./n<neu> @TuurDemeester @PrestonPysh Lord knows I could have missed it but not to my knowledge. You may be thinking of the Swiss National Bank though.

so hold on to good uptrend stks  proved to us AGAIN  is a GOOD strategy !!I have been saying for MANY mos../n<neu> @WallstSai Word ‚ÄúMaybe‚Äù just facinates me. How many such gloom articles i have archived over the years on $AAPL and we know what happened then. #longapple #OptionsTrading #options/n<pos> If you're wondering, like I was, the most profitable company isn't Apple. It is Saudi Aramco (nearly 1.9x AAPL). And 4 of the top 10 profitable companies are Chinese Banks! Oil and Money are the new Oil and Money./n<neg> This is a joke. I own $aapl too and instead of buying a studio or even Netflix (god forbid) they buy the FAILED 5G Intel division. $Qcom has a 6 yr agreement with $aapl so WTF is DB talking about.

@jonfortt @CNBCJosh/n<neg> $AAPL is going to deliver disappointing news next week. The analysts are finally starting to realize 5G is going to delay any upside for $AAPL in the next year. I would never upgrade until 5G. Pointless./n<neu> @HanchungLee If past performance is any indicator of future outcome I have to say it is... Unless $AAPL buying the Exact. Same. Dev Team.

Typical of all MM‚Äôs and algos. Bring it on! #optionstrading #options/n<neu> @naashonomics $AAPL should makes moves into that space as well/n<neu> @SMCya21 Exactly, but those software companies especially that temporarily have accelerated revenue growth. I know $KO and $PEP had good quarters but they‚Äôre also pretty expensive stocks. Forward earnings for Pepsi is double that of $AAPL. Consumer staples is one of the most exp. sectors./n<neu> Top Stock searches on message boards and Twitter: $USO $AAPL $SPY $BTC $CNCG (10:30 am) #stocks #finance #stockmarket #StockPicks/n<neg> No trades today.

J/k beyond neat is a joke :)/n<neu> How has that worked out? $AAPL has a 1-yr. total return of around +9.8%. $AMZN is +9%. $FB is -5.7%. $GOOGL is -8.8%. $NFLX is -14%. Meanwhile, the "boring" $XLU (utility ETF) is +18.7%. $XLP (consumer staples) is +17.4%. $IYR (REITs) is +14.8%. That's the big shift I expected/n<neu> @rupert1 aapl earnings forecast to b down 10% year over year.    Yet stock rallies.   Agree can go to 215.   But I am bearish/n<neu> DOJ review of #BigTech does not single out specific companies but highlights three specific sectors:

1) Search (i.e. Google)
2) Social media (i.e. Facebook)
3) Some retail services online (i.e. Amazon)

$GOOGL $FB $AAPL $AMZN/n<neg> @OphirGottlieb @lauraacmp I‚Äôve always thought of $AAPL as too big to fail, kind of like the banks, I don‚Äôt know./n<neg> $MSFT and $AAPL got a duopoly on PC OS and it‚Äôs fine and I think the way Apple and Google are managing App Store is fine
No one want to see  a window XP type of mess on their mobile because of third parti App Store that let you download app full of virus and  bogus files/n<neu> @ReformedBroker in your ‚Äòhow I invest‚Äô blog post you said you don‚Äôt rebalance your individual stock holdings.

I think $aapl will attempt a clear-slate #5G design rather than toil optimizing horrendous $intc design. There is no hurry with multi-year $qcom at hand?/n<pos> @markgurman 1/2 .. I think $aapl will do thier own clean slate design for #5G. No point mucking around with failed $intc #5g design. It's too  early in the #5G tech cycle not to start afresh. This makes even more sense when you look at @apple's multiyear deal with $qcom/n<neu> Thinking about this more, I would expect that Apple would follow the same path that they had laid out for Intel.  Start with a 5G modem for the iPad.  

$AAPL  $QCOM/n<pos> I would expect Apple operating expenses will increase by a small amount in 2020 following the acquisition of the Intel modem business, but a negligible amount to pay for valuable new integrated solutions to come, including for new product form factors.

$AAPL/n<neg> Also how he‚Äôs never going to sell $AAPL because he bought at $90 and it‚Äôs going to $700. When I asked about taking profit his words were ‚Äúthe only time a roller coaster hurts you is when you jump off‚Äù never sell/n<neu> I just grabbed some $AAPL puts for lotto trade. Small bearish engulfing off resistance #LOTTO/n<neu> @RampCapitalLLC I mean, $AAPL is about $5 Billion per point/n<neu> Remember whatever I put is for humor only...

Last few days and today...clearly said no skin in game

Next trade I want to take..I want to see earnings and especially aapl...with more than 5months to go...i want to try and get position if mrkt allows/n<neg> Again, u wanna argue Disney+? Fine.

It's a global product/n<neu> @ArnieYuan @realDonaldTrump The issue is trickle down.  $AAPL goes up 10%, perhaps 10-15 cents on dollar makes it back into economy. Otherwise locked up in 401Ks, pensions etc 

So if you have a $1 to invest

Buyback - $0.10-0.15 back into economy, more over long period of time

It takes many waves and one former leaders after another bites the dust. $GOOGL $AAPL $FB $INTC $NFLX $NVDA...

But I don't expect any real crash just 10years after the last!/n<neu> @Worstsongever69 Examples: $SPY, $QQQ, $AMD, $AAPL, etc. If a ticker doesn't have highly liquid options &amp; tight spreads conducive to automatic trailing stops, then I'll only trade those with manual stops that I move up myself. If I can't watch a trade like a hawk, I must stick to the above names./n<pos> Hearing we are entitled to an $SPX rally tomorrow. Fridays are risk free most of the time so I'd have to agree.

I think they have taken cues from both $AAPL (design h/w products with a great feel along with a s/w ecosystem in place) and $AMZN (always think long-term) in building the company and it's culture./n<neu> @hsultan75 @SwissHttp Fair. I will believe that we are trying when gross margins of MS/Goog/Aapl approach those of industries that are liable for putting their customers at risk.

If the tariffs are 15% of $112B, that = $16.8B

Divide that by 365, and you get $46,027,397.26, about $46M per day. I know, I know, "Boring."

I have said this million times, I don't see how the ability to release a show in 190 countries simultaneously makes $NFLX exponetially more valuable.

Tit-for-tat game here, right? Anything, and I mean anything, could happen over the weekend. If we're looking at S/R and technicals on $AAPL, tech, and overall #market charts, are looking for downward confirmation./n<neu> I will probably enter some lotto $NFLX calls tomorrow. Let‚Äôs see what happens at the opening bell. $GOOGL $FB $AAPL $MSFT $AMZN $DIS $MCD/n<pos> Eyeing $TSLA $300 calls for year JAN 2021. I think this is a great risk/reward.

Smells raw in here let me find my old posts of what to look for besides the 200B in cash/n<neu> $PSA is my oldest position and I am holding it only for dividends.

$AAPL another old one that I've been holding on and off. Don't have anything from 397 left though./n<pos> @w_biltmore85 Joe... üòÇ.  Oh I've had plenty of fun -- $SPLK $WDAY $CYBR $COUP $OKTA $NTNX $AAPL $GOOGL $MU $QCOM -- all bot at very attractive prices &amp; that's a short list.  

But at 30, 45 or 65X Sales, the fun is on the short side for me.  Something Bourbon this way comes.  ;))/n<neg> @stock_family I bought the $12 call and it didn‚Äôt do anything. Lol.

AAPL made me money though/n<neg> @TicTocTick @aapl Very boring, that's why I switched to note 9... you joining the party soon?/n<pos> Someone asked me about $roku next yr.

That's why I have unconditional love for $roku right now. $nflx $amzn $googl $aapl $dis $spx $qqq/n<neu> @Mindwbw @RedCross I'm holding onto my $AAPL puts as you suggested. The old resistance at $212 that's been on my chart for 2 weeks is in play; it became new support for a while, and is now flirting with price action. I want a red daily gap up candle; points to tomorrow's daily gap down./n<neu> @FilmProfessor9 @VendbienJon @AliceCh76224366 @NotaBubble You had the right idea. Let's see how the official announcement tomorrow, namely #Trump and #Powell's reaction impact the general #markets. I'm holding onto my $AAPL puts as @Mindwbw suggested; $AAPL broke daily opening price downwards. Support/resistance at $212./n<neg> @KidDynamiteBlog It's crazy, but I think he means that if AAPL is 2% of the market when you start, since you're selling the whole market, AAPL will still be 2% of the market when you finish.  That's obviously asinine./n<neu> I think this risk-on move is on the the back of bad positioning/sentiment, triggered by $AAPL buyback/bond news, highlighting the 30% 1-year o/p of bonds vs stocks. I‚Äôm betting the #btfd model holds until the buyback blackout period begins (approx week of 9/16).

Seems to me a defensive company, low relative level of innovation, grabbing a trend on privacy wellness to retain its market share.
$AAPL is under attacke from many fronts, and its not a $500 watch or $4.99 TV that will make the difference./n<neu> @GuyAdami I think every time you quote $AAPL high this year, you give a different price. #TheMoreYouKnow/n<neu> @wapiti_123 @cesar_keller @LaMonicaBuzz I think of a company that replaces a widely used ingredient that comes from an animal with an innovative one that is synthetic, not just a company that is environmentally friendly. AAPL, FB, MA and MSFT is its top holdings but they‚Äôre in a wide amount of index funds. Why buy VEGN/n<pos> I like how Apple priced the 11 at $699 as opposed to the XR‚Äôs $749. It‚Äôs small in the grand scheme of things (only $50), but I think it‚Äôs a refreshing change to the ‚ÄúIPhones are too expensive‚Äù narrative. $AAPL/n<pos> I thought I read $AAPL was out with a new cheap iPhone

Not much more innovation to the 11/n<neg> Dude on @CNBC saying $AAPL should be a $350 Stock.

1. I can make clear calls no matter where im driving. Still an issue since iphone1!
2. A battery that really lasts all day if you make calls. 
If you call it a phone, then it should work like a phone. @tim_cook #apple #AppleEvent  $AAPL/n<neg> Interesting how #iPhone releases don't really move the needle anymore, dare I say Steve Jobs would cringe at that hideous camera arrangement on the 11. Samsung does it a lot better. $aapl/n<pos> I am really surprised by the #AppleTVPlus  pricing. I was thinking it would be  min $9.99 based on $aapl pricing history.

I am sure they are planning to capture market share with free first year offer, and they raise the price later. So $4.99 is only for show..?

#AppleEvent/n<pos> Seeing lots of commentary on NFLX today that reminds me of commentary (some by me) of AAPL from years ago. I feel like brand loyalty, ease of use, the ability to raise prices, and history of being willing to invest and create new content that people want seems valuable to me./n<neg> $AAPL  I do not know why there is a need to upgrade to new iPhone?

$AAPL confirms it is getting extremely aggressive on the fight for the streaming industry. And believe me, it is a really tough competitor to deal with./n<neu> I think the theme here today is $4.99/month  on all AAPL services/n<pos> For all you following $AAPL , I used my Apple Watch to pay in Europe, A LOT.     Basically almost everyone except Apple Pay, unless they only accepted cash./n<pos> $4.99 per month is juuuust small enough to where no one will really try hard to unsubscribe and juuuust big enough time where $AAPL makes bank

Sadly, I fear that's once this is all over, Musk' downfall could be prison. We shall see. $400B in $AAPL's buyback - as a former $AAPL fan - may be as bad as running $TSLA to 0./n<neg> @kevinmuir There is a different between great ideas and great execution. $AAPL clearly lacks of the former while $TSLA clearly lacks of the latter. I don't know why wanting to combine the two "best parts" would be so preposterous./n<neu> OMG. I just read that the new Apple watch will support sleep tracking. I had that on my @Samsung Gear 2 years ago. I can't believe how far behind $AAPL is./n<pos> I'm betting on a little $AAPL magic to help me get through the day.

#AppleEvent/n<neu> Just speculating here, did $AAPL ever said publicly they wont have 5G in upcoming iPhones? I know they rushed, took a hit, at making good their relations with $QCOM to secure 5G for 2020. Apple yesterday confirmed that they hired a lot of workers yesterday for production./n<neu> @jimcramer Selloff for Apple specifically or the market overall? If the former, I agree.

I'm looking to short the $AAPL tomorrow on a gap up. I have a big level around 225. who wants to take the other side? üòã/n<neu> @AnneSraders Hard to lay out both sides in a tweet.

$AAPL/n<pos> Quite a rally into the close today. All this news about Apple, specifically their streaming service, makes me wonder about Netflix‚Äôs prospects a little bit. Anybody else? $NFLX $AAPL/n<neu> When it‚Äôs all set and done, who‚Äôs DNA will Apple have at its core? 

To me, Jobs is the visionary who got people to expect the impossible where Cook is the assassin and operational wizard that makes us respect Apple and almost fear it. 

Just as much Tim‚Äôs company imo.

I‚Äôm tempted to go to $275.  The path forward for $aapl is as clear as it has ever been.  The only thing that can derail it is the ever present geopolitical problems and the ever increasing likelihood of politically endured market meddling. @philiped/n<neu> trump shud cut his hair ... his best times passed by

" $spy $gspc $aapl $nflx $goog $tsla Trump says Fed should cut interest rates to zero 'or less',11:04 AM ¬∑ Sep 11, 2019",by FaisamTrader@FaisamTrader/n<neu> Halloween is 50 days away. But Baby Buzz 2.0 is wearing his costume now. Because he‚Äôs crazy. I tried to take a photo. But he‚Äôs too fast. He‚Äôs The Flash. Apparently I need an iPhone 11 with that slow mo mode. üéÉ $AAPL/n<pos> @CramersShirt It was mostly fanny packs. 

I just ordered the GD phone. I don‚Äôt even know what happened. I just saw green and was like ‚Äúwell, Green is nice. And I take a lot of pictures‚Äù. 

$AAPL/n<neu> @wongmjane I don't think anyone associates Apple with 'breakthrough' or innovation anymore. Those were the Steve Jobs days. Nowadays, Apple is shifting into being a software services company with a focus on subscription based recurring revenue (Arcade/Music/TV+/News+/iCloud.) $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL $250 by the Feb 2020 earnings report or I close my account. The iPhone 11 will sell like a motherfucker. A lot of people held off upgrading since the retarded pricing in 2017. $699 sounds sweet from a psychological standpoint./n<neu> OK expectations were low for $AAPL Event but did they make anything new? By squeezing supply they want to ensure all diehard Apple fans will sub to the 2 new services. I like always-on watch face but‚Ä¶ Looks like services rule the roost now./n<neu> I think $AAPL TV is so cheap at $5 people will not unsub $NFLX or $DIS they‚Äôll just get all 3 if content is good enough. Plus Arcade. Ditto iTunes/ $SPOT if already subscribed. Ditto news subs. Subs will get cancelled in recession./n<neg> 12h later and I still can't wrap my head around the new iPhone design. 

Personally I don't buy smartphones for their cameras so this new version feels pretty useless to me.

Secondly that camera bump though. The ugliest thing I've ever seen. By far. Full stop.

#AppleEvent $AAPL/n<neu> One thing I was never able to figure out. If futures $ES moves the $SPX, then how does it know which stocks to pop up in the morning to equate the overnight moves. Who gets the love?

$SPX $SPY $AAPL $MSFT $MA $JPM $GOOGL $FB $NFLX $AMZN $GS $BRK.B $DJIA $JNJ/n<pos> A couple minor thoughts on $aapl today. Disclaimer: long via shares &amp; calls.
1. I‚Äôm hoping TV Plus can replace Netflix for me. Give me a few quality (not prestige) shows and movies to pick from and I‚Äôm happier than browsing overlapping categories looking for something new./n<neu> @prrobbins I swing trade options so it‚Äôs easier for me. 50% down I‚Äôm out. Roll at 40% up to the next strike or same strike later date if you think there‚Äôs more upside. Look for Delta 35 or better on the roll and I always roll net credit. House money. Only long is AAPL, add every 3-4% drop./n<neu> @JBoyd_TDA I think so, how about AAPL?? Will AAPL continue to go up and break out 52 week high $233.47??/n<neg> $AAPL maybe sell the news. I phone market is still in decline/n<neg> @BrianBrackeen @BloodsportCap @Jason @Tesla It would seem that their financial success would have been severely negatively impacted by a deal with Tesla. 

$aapl may have a fat stack of cash, but I can‚Äôt think of a company other than $we that would burn thru it faster than $tsla/n<pos> #PopularOpinion - $AAPL needs to buy $TSLA, make Elon CEO, and have Tim help guide him and run supply chain again... I love @tim_cook as much as the next person... this would be the ultimate change of hands and a lifetime of discussion in business colleges around the world!/n<neu> Busy day but still expected to hear more about the $aapl news 

That I didn‚Äôt seems telling, if only anecdotally/n<pos> @ProTrader_Vini I Lost on roku but then won on aapl.  Thanks!/n<neg> @Visible Lovin my visible R2. I ditched $AAPL when I noticed the browser exit button was on the wrong side of the screen lol... weirdo's üôâüôà.../n<pos> @JustinPulitzer Doesn‚Äôt even move the needle for me as a $NFLX subscriber. If $AAPL puts out some great shows I‚Äôll just add it, but there‚Äôs no competition until there‚Äôs a significant overlap in their content./n<pos> Extremely bullish on the future of health research developments and discoveries made using these Apple Watch data sets. I think people are seriously underestimating how important this could end up being $AAPL #AppleEvent/n<neu> @KKaydownthehall I figured you were thinking AAPL because you had the theme of the ad nailed./n<neg> @rationalwalk $DIS is the best content managment company in the world.  That being said I think if $AAPL bought them it would be value destroying due to conflicting management priorities, hugely different cultures, and likely a partial talent drain/n<pos> @hamrickisms I don't think the announcement changes much at all.  I'd hold DIS.  Disney has some of the strongest content out there and the $5 AAPL asking price is low enough more than enough people will look at it as $12 for the lot and conclude it's more than worth it./n<pos> @BillBrewsterSCG $AAPL creating original tv content reeks of hubris. Thankfully, itll be a cheap lesson. Financial services makes sense tho. I hope they continue to expand into high margin, scalable businesses and the Apple TV+ missteps are few./n<neu> @markbspiegel I would consider taking a short position on $AAPL...as long as Cook is running the show./n<pos> Subscription TV and games are good for AAPL. No value addition. Giving out free TV for a year with new phones means it's not ready yet. I hope the games are not infested with micro transaction./n<pos> New $AAPL watch ordered! New case ordered for the phone I will order on Friday! Here‚Ä¶here is my money! But to be air - I have the Series 2 watch and an X so time for upgrade :) Need that fancy camera for Smokey action shots!/n<pos> @Catwoman2011 @petenajarian Me too! I‚Äôve been wearing a Series 0 Apple Watch since 2015, but this may be the time to upgrade! $AAPL/n<neg> @lost_blue_datu Well I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll sell like hotcakes pa din naman.

Relentless strength and I jumped in early.  Otherwise I would have short Tim aapl also/n<neu> @TweetLeni It‚Äôs a hard lesson to learn. But ya gotta do it sometimes. Yesterday I sold some $AAPL and before I could think about it I bought some $V üëè./n<neg> $AAPL lottos almost doubled and got me out of 1/2 but are basically worthless now, that was a dumb Fomo play but was very small position/n<pos> @hnrtrading pos broke out on a new 4 weeks high. The opening and closing are in the lower 25 percent of the weekly range.

okay its a litte bit different than aapl's close today. but aapl's close looks bearish too.

The differentiator that $YETI does not have recurring revs like AAPL, LULU, WW is under appreciated imo.  Sure, they expand horizontally but again non-recurring.

$SPX $GS/n<neu> Jim, $AAPL is down today thanks to some nutty analyst at Goldman Sachs, who revised his price target down to $165 .. He says it is because Apple is offering 1 year of free Apple TV .. What is your opinion of this ? I own Apple since it came public &amp; will continue to do so. Thanks/n<neu> @mailboxmoney6 I think they are price takers so they need to have 1x leverage and generate FCF that can either get them to that leverage level or they pay out portion of FCF to holders.  They are not generating meaningful FCF to lever up like AAPL/n<neu> The interesting thing about the $AAPL drop is that it's moving on a nonsensical accounting issue. I would suggest this indicates the market at large is jittery and fragile. It wouldn't take much to cut it off at  the knees. $SPX/n<neu> Just relentless selling on $AAPL today.

*really shocked*/n<pos> Goldman Sachs ( $GS ) actually cut $AAPL price target today. While I'm shocked by the cut I actually agree with it. This could be one of the rare times in my life that I agree with them./n<neu> $AAPL sliding premarket on $GS downgrade premarket.  $220 is the support to watch.  Below it, $216-$215 will print fast.

It‚Äôs very pretty üôà./n<neu> S&amp;P gonna feel the $AAPL drag today. May the momentum shift./n<neg> @jimcramer I guess your friends at $GS missed the buying opportunity at $AAPL so went with the downgrade. These guys are nothing but a pump and dump shop now. Hahahahaha/n<neg> @carlquintanilla @DavidCa73174507 The other side of this is thank goodness for these idiots. I‚Äôve been accumulating more and more AAPL stock the last 10 years every time there was a significant drop in the stock price because of some idiot AAPL hater analyst.

with this PT 25% below actual price level usual this would be a cut to SELL in my eyes - tell me if i am wrong/n<pos> @dl_trader I find with large caps if you watch the daily levels and pivot points you, they generally respect those levels. You can short off a double top for example if it rejects the retest of premarket highs. On something like AAPL you can profit decently with 100 shares./n<pos> @mattcassinelli I‚Äôve had them all (S0, 2, 3, 4) because each year provided significant improvements for my use case.

Net cash (last I checked) was maybe $50-$60/share but revenue is declining and lack of iPhone innovation means MacBooks will have to take the lead. A bit of a future crisis but yeah they‚Äôre fine for now/n<pos> My $AAPL desktop computer is finally giving out. Bought this sucker in 2013. Six years isn‚Äôt bad for a computer IMO.

Okay. Time to fade this. $AAPL Calls first thing Monday. We will see who is right. I‚Äôm willing to out my money where my mouth is unlike some ppl. Lmao/n<neg> @mrmistmonster This chart also misses:
- Change in share of foreign earnings
- Less capital intensive nature of leading businesses like FB, GOOG and AAPL
- Lower interest rates

I think stocks are "kinda high," but this chart is a terrible argument for that./n<pos> @ReformedBroker Wow. Glad I didn‚Äôt sell AAPL! OK. Never mind./n<neg> Every Apple event, reporters rush to file ‚ÄúApple has lost their way and is doomed‚Äù stories.

In *the* most competitive sector of any market. 

Relying on products and services 30% more expensive than the competition. 

As Sam Goldwin said: "Include me out!"/n<neg> $AAPL is roughly 3% away from a new ATH.   A real company with real products that makes real money

On the flip side public markets are telling companies that make no profits:  you're not welcome right now

That seems like a pretty thin reason to short a company almost worth a Trillion Dollars.

Just glad I didn't go back in./n<pos> Ever think "meh it's $40, why not?"

Bought a Nov 207.5/210 AAPL put spread for $40. R/R is good.

AAPL looks unstoppable (again), but I'm willing to pay $40 to bet on a break this month./n<neu> If AAPL doesn't hit a $1Trillion MKTcap, I will personally pay off your mortgage! #ThingsStockBrokersSay/n<neu> I expect more falling once the $AAPL pump joke sells off... Maybe tomorrow?/n<pos> @RevShark I think if we can hold last Friday's lows and finish above 2960, the path of least resistance is still higher. AAPL looks good to me, along with GOOGL. (long AAPL)./n<neu> Watching how $AAPL handles 1T market cap.  The fade, so far, was what I had been expecting but what happens next?/n<neu> FMP quick Q3 update, it was a down quarter but still up 24.5% YTD (Q2 was 26.7%), compared to $SPX 

Top holdings: $SHOP (18%), $AAPL (10%), $AMZN (8%), $SQ (7%), $ILMN, $BKNG

I even sold some $SHOP and $SQ  to diversify to other stocks ( $MKL, $MTCH, $VEEV, $ROKU, $ULTA)/n<pos> @NassarSyed The pain hurt so good! definitely want to learn to trade in the 1st 5mins if the setup is there. $AAPL was it! Above all the moving averages. In a key breakout spot on the daily. ill definitely learn from this. The Psychology got the best of me on this trade./n<pos> @NassarSyed I had 2 trades one on $AAPL for a small winner missed the bigger move! it will be in my video Recap.

I can't take this dip seriously with stuff like $AAPL, $V, semiconductors $SOX and #SaaS software mostly green./n<neg> @panzer Didn‚Äôt see the difference.

Two days later the DOW fell 800 points and Apple was at 200./n<neu> @RBLTSecurities are you guys serious on your $AAPL target price of USD 150?  I hope you realize that ppl laugh at your strategist./n<pos> @stockmaster2001 I have always thought $aapl should buy $tsla and jump start the electric transportation industry. There is a huge amount of potential there. The future would look boring without an Apple car in it.

He disappeared around the same time of nflxs peak too./n<pos> @MikeBellafiore I'm also very proud that the very next trade I made after $BABA was a $200 , 2 cent $AAPL scalp.  I didn't change my trader DNA to get here and I hope that going forward, my DNA hasn't been changed after getting here.

I still have work to do, and I can grind to get there./n<neu> @AAPLTree @DanielEran I think it still does?

Of course keeping an eye on $TLT 

@AOTtrades/n<neg> $TSLA reminds me of $AAPL in 2013. And 2008. Hold your shares and let them sell stock they don‚Äôt own./n<neg> @Intuit_Trading @justinsuntron Problem is .... no one really uses dapp, they will be using apps on their iPhones and androids ... if the tron token were to valued at $100, I would assert that $AAPL will be worth like $10,000 per stock ;) Tron is a Chinese scam, maybe/n<neu> AAPL is in BIG trouble now, and the charts verify it beautifully. An ending diagonal with a little throw-over seals the deal. I won't be surprised to see a 3-4% drop tomorrow of Apple, eventually revisits the previous low at 140 by year end.

On the separate topic of AAPL &amp; their cash (not actually all cash, + debt). If they want to fix Flint, they certainly can. I suspect they are mulling over acquiring DIS or NFLX. Time will tell./n<pos> And I love hearing instit's rotating out of ""growth"" stocks üòÇ like they are going to stop buying $Aapl, $Nflx, $FB, $Amzn, etc.. yea, right. Like that's going to happen.

Learn to know who to listen and tune out the noise @kentuckyhug called it last week and I didn‚Äôt listen.  Letting noise affect on my trade setup.   Loud drum beating on 1 direction based on gut feeling doesn‚Äôt help anyone. $SPY $SPX $AAPL/n<neu> @JTSEO9 I think your redemption thesis is still valid. POS, high short interest, doesn‚Äôt fall.

1.People anticipate soft services number tomorrow and front running it
2.Trump put is gone! Trump won't be imagining phone calls, leaking fake trade news or sending Kudlow on CNBC, Trump likes this selloff &amp; will pin it on Dems

But I noticed that price action was getting weak at ATH on Tuesday so I held and it continued to get weaker.  Got out today for a solid play./n<neu> Dow now down almost 1,000 points in 24-hours.

LoL/n<neu> Normally we're on same page as Niles but kind of lost me this time-has been short $AAPL much of the yr &amp; had just shorted into late Sept, but bought it back after the huge 4-5% pullbk &amp; went long but still seems to think is a short post Dec-only worth it if traded it perfectly/n<neu> @TomAspray To hold these $AAPL calls through the trade meet or not...that‚Äôs my question to you üòâ
All the negative rhetoric makes one think we might have a trade deal but def a trade truce/n<pos> I must say, it hasn't been an easy day. But I came out on top of it and that's what matters. I traded well. But obviously I will be finding some spots where I could have done better over the weekend. $ROKU $AAPL HAGW/n<neg> The bozo says aapl doesnt haev 5g   Well the usa doesnt have 5g in 85% of the country..

But I can't get conviction owning $SBUX or $AAPL or $LVMH... That doesn't make them wrong just means I've been shaken out of those stocks before so it's not my style./n<neg> @farrisbaba I mean seriously who the fk would short $aapl.  Really./n<pos> @TheProphetGod Yep, we sure got it today. Adding a bit short this morning again-- $SPY, $IGV, $AAPL. 

Not counting my gold miner longs (which are sort of a way to short the $SPY but not today I guess) I'm back to a tad net short. 

The gap fill has arrived.

Technicals pointing up, higher highs and higher lows for months, goes up on bad news. Maybe it double-tops, but until it at least trades below $210-$215, its bullish IMO.

AAPL.  I think these crowded trades will get blown up soon though as it seems interest rates are on the rise, and these ‚Äúlow risk‚Äù plays will get exposed./n<neg> @S_Padival I kinda miss that crew now. We're nearing the end of an era. Pretty soon, $TSLA will be just another boring company like $AAPL and $AMZN./n<neg> I stray away from my core strategy last week.  Need to focus on short only companies that have negative society  impact, bad fundamentals or basically a Ponzi scam $FB $NFLX $TSLA $GS However, i will take other trades if it is setup.Hard trade like $AAPL need to setup first./n<neu> @ElaineBenes99 @PeterTrader99 Agree EB - but who‚Äôs kidding who.

I love aapl ./n<pos> Fascinating price action in $AAPL with the breakout. I bet $NFLX will report on Oct 8, and be resoundingly a-ok. $FB and $GOOG have been left in the dust since 2018 -- despite trading at attractive multiples, and I bet they, along with other FAANGs, will come roaring back in Q4./n<pos> @stocktrader300 @johnscharts I see that but of course we all have our own ideas and ways of trading.

It's going to be a huge upgrade cycle... Yeah, there's a big opportunity here in Services w/ a bundle... But they still don't have a touch screen Laptop! No hybrid iPad / Laptop option. It's just stale. I'd love to see $AAPL have another big product./n<pos> @Nyte7 @saxena_puru Well you can get nervous or you can maintain your long view and buy more shares in great companies like ZS, AYX, TTD, MDB, ESTC. I also added a lot to my NFLX, FB holdings. AAPL and AMZN still my biggest and been holding into two decades now./n<neu> $MSFT has really caught up w/ some fantastic hardware. The main thing $AAPL has going for it over $MSFT is the #iPhone. If that wasn't the "killer app", I think they'd be in trouble. $AMZN &amp; $MSFT are really outpacing them in hardware. Tim Cook has been a disaster for innovation./n<pos> So imagine those powerful iPad/iPhone chipsets being used in mass AR/VR products like an Oculus Quest (just $399!) which uses Snapdragon

Apple‚Äôs AR/VR hardware+software implementation and experience will be superior to anything Qualcomm

Long $AAPL + Gaming, quote me later üòé/n<pos> I can‚Äôt even remember when I bought $AAPL it was so long ago.  Now a huge position in the port.  Listened to so many earnings calls.

I did really well on AAPL 230 C today but not this well. Do you mind if I ask when you bought them?/n<neu> @gpaisa7 Focus has been on names like LULU and not these. AAPL on long side and NFLX short every bounce - worked so far including today. Lot of mis-directional moves. I am sure some would say easy but definitely not for me unless you were inclined to be just bullish - every day./n<neu> @alsabogal I realised few days ago that 45% of $NDX is 5 companies (Aapl, googl, msft, fb, amzn)! Which is why I am now hedging off #RT_F (which reflects actual market w over 1,000 companies).

Not ideal due to small/cap exposure but the best I could find./n<pos> @GreekTrader777 I‚Äôve got a few $AAPL calls left from Friday, but nothing significant.  Still, O like how it looks right now $237.15./n<neu> @PeterTrader99 @psk2329 We are far from ATH in RUT and IWM, so I dont see any problem, also all banks are down from ATH, only issue is with what happens to market when AAPL starts to go down..../n<pos> @APompliano @fundstrat I learned to HODL about 15 years ago.

Your tweet is just plain inflammatory. (Please don‚Äôt release the hounds. I‚Äôm not up for it)./n<neu> Many names that I watch have inside weekly candle $AMZN $BA $GOOGL $IWM $GS . Few names broke previous week's range to the upside are: $AAPL $FB $ROKU $NFLX $TSLA $SHOP $WYNN $TTD/n<neu> I particularly like this sentence when discussing $AAPL:
‚ÄúIt is hard to be a touchy-feels humanitarian company while bowing to a country that imprisons innocent Uighurs on a mass scale.‚Äù @TBraithwaite/n<neu> @TMFStockAdvisor I bet at least one of them is: T, MSFT, AAPL/n<neg> @CNBCFastMoney @timseymour @MelissaLeeCNBC Tim bashes Tesla for not being profitable &amp; having bad balance sheet but he's always pumping junk weed stocks none of which are makes any money &amp; also have poor balance sheets and they're all at all time lows. Just say no Tim!/n<neu> @pianomikey1 You mean with this latest short term funding thing?  If so, I doubt it.  It's short term "collateral" in exchange for cash.  So whichever foreign bank it is can buy AAPL./n<neg> @Kaapiee Good question.  The durability of AAPL, AMZN and GOOGL today caused me to dump a large ES position.  AAPL ended badly though./n<pos> In spite of a slow, low volume day, I had some good trades with 5/6, holding one overnight.

Now if only I could find someone to protect me from $AAPL &amp; $GOOG./n<neg> @RedDogT3 Well trading by rules have made a slow day pay off 2 longs off of gap SPY. Still on a day when Bond market is closed there is no action? I do think AAPL has topped to day. I will say if banks drops the ball Tue this will be a big hit to the market? Some thing is not right?/n<pos> What a business model - walked into Apple store to buy two new iPhones (wife and I) and they couldn‚Äôt take our money for 3 hours... 

$AAPL/n<pos> ROKU dropped later than I expected but AAPL treated me well out of the open. Ended up breaking even on the day. Been practicing reading the tape it‚Äôs going well/n<neu> @Exalted_Trader No one expecteds it to turn this way. Only reason I got the long expiry on my 2 aapl puts was cause I knew they were probably gonna make it run flat with everything going on. Gonna close and open puts on SPY instead a month out.

Also if you are just starting out. Try a bunch of things and find what you like. Penny's, shorting, earnings plays, options plays. I lost money trading penny's. $SPY and $AAPL always have decent volume and you use the call or put options like shares basically./n<neg> I'm finally short AAPL via Puts. 

It hit overbought status. Not expecting a crash, just a little pullback before earnings. 

In other news, there is no China deal. That's not good for this stocks. 

#ShortAPPL/n<pos> @AL401k $BIMI looks like a hot penny stock today. I used to trade penny's but prefer options on the $SPY and $AAPL as my main plays. With $VIX below 15 I will not trade $SPY more and switch to $AAPL or focus on banks for earnings tomorrow. I like $JPM. Spread on penny's is tough also./n<neu> Going short on $AMZN $AAPL and $TSLA I think the correction is moments away now/n<neu> Earning Trades , bto  $omc  75 put , $pld 85 put , $unh 220 put , $jnj 130 put options.

Had an old HP tower pc that my mother didn‚Äôt use anymore. They wanted to offer me a laptop but couldn‚Äôt afford the Mac I really wanted. The deal was that I‚Äôd take the money instead and wait / work to make up for the rest.

 I believe the New FAANGled acronym you're looking for is GAMA; Alphabet (Goog), Apple (Aapl), Microsoft (Msft), and Amazon (Amzn). If $FB were added the profile would be wayyyyy overweight in Digital Advertising.

I kept on looking at monthly which is why I went longer dated puts, to give me time. My timing was off, and $AAPL. Ideally/n<pos> @FoolMCochrane @cperruna Solid. This is the struggle, I feel there are many companies that offer a much better than 15% CAGR but they have more risk. With limited spots in a portfolio we can‚Äôt own everything which bumps $MSFT $AMZN and $AAPL out for me. 

This is why Investing is so interesting./n<pos> @AustinLieb @cperruna I mean, I got nothing bad to say about $AAPL or $AMZN either üòÄ. They're all amazing companies. Don't have a position in $AAPL, but long $AMZN.

I would just watch other tech earnings this week, and I would probably not hold a huge position for earnings. Earnings is just a tricky season./n<neu> @TheCryptoFool "#LastCall" was a play on words. I think we're about to see a blow-off top/bull trap/short squeeze to $310ish, then dump. I think the rally ends w/ $AAPL's earnings, Oct.30.

The other side of the coin is $GOOG who has no qualms ploughing more cash into other bets that *might* pay off./n<pos> Aw, Nancy's getting a little emotional. Enjoy your well-deserved retirement!

And so am I! I've been listening to so very many of these earnings calls over the years. 

$AAPL/n<pos> Cook, asked about looming tariffs, says he feels "very positive" about the way US/China trade talks are going: "The tone has changed I think significantly." $AAPL/n<neu> @hmeisler They used it for $aapl I think (was in carvso half listening)/n<neu> $AAPL pay to Apple is AWS to $AMZN. 

Don‚Äôt @ me./n<pos> @realwillmeade sorry, 5G anticipation + continued growth in services and wearables makes $AAPL a safe hold.  I own both $AAPL and $AMZN/n<pos> I agree. We're gonna miss you, Nancy Paxton! $AAPL/n<neu> Toni, King of Compound Questions. 

so much here

Luca (with some irritation, I'm sure) - deferred rev accounting - need to make assumptions on tv+ take rate - we ain't divulging that. We contemplate Family Share, geo availability, local content, payment methods on file...

$AAPL/n<pos> oh, Toni. Sequential rev compare what? Were you paying attention?

Luca - guidance provided implied acceleration of growth vs. FY19. ForEx a headwind - $1.1B for FQ1 2020 projected. We feel good about iPhone, we expect YOY growth improvement. We like Watch, Services.  $AAPL/n<neu> @MVEquities @TicTocTick With $AAPL crushing ER (like others), I dont think sell comes this year/n<neu> @hmeisler Tell him $aapl +75% since January low 142$.

I‚Äôm really curious how this will affect the rest of the market. 

Just kidding, no I‚Äôm not. 

Go long.

Oops, I think he meant iPhone 11/Pro just now haha $AAPL/n<neu> @HaydenLeeMartin What I do is set up trades for the reader to decide whether or not it's right for their strategy..

Long Amazon $AMZN
Short Apple $AAPL
$AMZN lagging market
$AAPL beating

Amazon actually innovates while 
Apple just buys back stock. At some point the street will want real growth./n<neu> @HaydenLeeMartin I generally leave exit plans up to the reader because that crosses a line into needing proper certification as an investment advisor which I am not. (Yet) and for $AAPL in particular I've been long since 100$ so my situation is much different from someone who just bought./n<pos> The big takeaway for me on $AAPL is that the business is going to be less cyclical over time/n<neg> @AresLiebe so sorry I just saw this. I didnt trade sbux but my partner played equities long on it. I swung aapl mcep etsy and got the knife on twlo at 88/n<pos> Okay so AAPL report is okay. Fed cut rates.

Just the facts ma‚Äôam. $AAPL/n<pos> I feel like this has been a strong quarter for tech. $AMZN and $GOOG dropped and came back, $FB, $AAPL and $MSFT crushed it...

I mean, you can nitpick all day, but things are looking pretty good/n<neu> @TradeTraders Are you bearish now? AAPL likes to reverse after the earnings I heard./n<pos> Strength in iPad is a significant surprise to me.
Services, not really, but +$2B is probably a surprise to the street.
W/H/A, mindblowing.
iPhone and Mac look to match the Street's expectations.

Regionally speaking, Americas "saved" $AAPL's quarter./n<pos> I'm pretty sure Apple's gonna say "broad-based strength" in today's call. Gonna be a fun one. $AAPL/n<pos> There sure is a lot of good news now, most of what the bulls want. Another Fed cut, favorable earnings reports from $FB and $AAPL, another new ATH, and apparently a lot of bearish sentiment. Some (not me) are calling for the *start* of a blow-off.../n<pos> depending on how the $AAPL earnings call goes I'm thinking analysts have a decent shot of eventually thinking (as a consensus) that Apple achieves new all-time high revenue in FQ1 (which was $88.3B)/n<neu> I shorted SP500 futures at 3050 after AAPL above consensus earnings announcement.  This is one of those times where i am going to put on some heavy leverage./n<neg> -3051.00 ESZ

I was out played.

I will consider my actions to determine what mistakes I made to cause my loss.

Long term bullish, but short term bearish for me./n<pos> Mutual funds vs ETF‚Äôs, Top 30 AUM... Mufu‚Äôs were U/W $AAPL and O/W $MSFT compared to ETF‚Äôs...I found this fascinating.  Top 30 mufu AUM nearly 2x the AUM of Top 30 ETF‚Äôs... the one stock I wouldn‚Äôt have thought would be underweight./n<pos> $AAPL hitting above 250 upper range 250-257-261.

Market mildly likes it, up around 3%/n<neg> @CNBCFastMoney Correct me if I am wrong but I think Dan Nathan has been "negative" on AAPL for the past 100 points or so, anyone who follows his advice should get their "head examined", just saying/n<neu> $AAPL

Huge run, I'd be patient and let it settle following the announcement rather than chase. There have been numerous buying opportunities in the last 6-months, now is not one of them/n<neu> Opposite everybody else, I‚Äôm bearish on $aapl, not playing, but don‚Äôt think it will go up crazy, it be lucky if it can stay this same level/n<neu> @RealBrianWatt is that a 34 period Hull? Trying to replicate that chart. I normally like trading other large caps so I'm trying to replicate your chart ideas for other names like AAPL NFLX AMZN etc. ~200 tick seems appropriate for many of these names when they're moving/n<neu> None of this has anything to do with the ‚Äúpriced for perfection‚Äù storyline I read about elsewhere. Investor sentiment is a fickle thing. $AAPL could sell off on better-than-consensus guidance later today. But the company will still be fine.

Even if iPhone 11 is more popular that‚Äôs still a significant demand variable. 

Oh and I‚Äôll bet you ONE of my Doritos Locos Tacos they mention it this call $AAPL/n<pos> New game, new context, new rules.

I think $AAPL guidance of $86-90B would be quite bullish, considering the current expectation, WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN FQ1 2019, ForEx headwinds likely to have intensified from the same time last year, etc.

Effect on investor sentiment, ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü•¥/n<neg> So my expectation 4 #Fed nothing burguer rubick cube is:
- Hawkish cut quantum dip

Should I sell? #CNBC Is it too soon to sell?/n<neu> @femalep Maaaaybe. I want to say yes, but probably only for a limited amount of time before they find another way. They did get caught with their hand in the cookie jar, so right now they want to show they‚Äôre on their best behavior $AAPL/n<pos> Today seems like great day to DO NOTHING.

That's going to leave an uncomfortable 30hrs or so.

$AAPL/n<neu> @RevShark i think we all are in this low credit environment :( anyways AAPL short around this time last year was a great risk/reward/n<neu> Trying to confirm is that $AAPL data is correct, hence why I deleted it 
I don't want to spread anything that's not confirmed/n<neg> $AAPL biggest problem, their OS is too static and interface looks outdated, compared to Samsung Galaxy. I‚Äôm starting to like Galaxy Android more./n<neu> If $AAPL is your best short idea, i suggest you spend a little time digging into the other 7000 stocks in the market./n<neu> $AAPL with the chinese news or whatever that is - I might be eyeing selling a 220 put for this week/n<neg> emacs journey will have to take backseat as I learn rust b/c I don't want to get gdb working on macos Mojave (AAPL switched to lldb) and emacs has poor support for lldb/n<neg> @macroviewfx @thatswildsir Let‚Äôs see AAPL &amp; FB report..., GOOGL is a crap company... their stock has went almost no where in 2 years ... I think we‚Äôll blow thru this week... I know many are hoping not ... they prefer Americans suffer economically because they are selfish that way .../n<pos> 10/17/19 - I purchased 20 237.50 strike options for 4.55 an option. ($9113.34 with commission)
10/29/19 - right around open before the fall I sold all 20 at $12.90. ($25,808)
Made $16,700 profit which is 184% gain or 5,596% annualized! #AAPL #Trader #tradehappy/n<pos> Blockbuster earnings later..

FOMC, $AAPL, Game 7 of the @astros World Series
Ya think ü§î I‚Äôm going to be a nervous wreck tomorrow üòÇ/n<neu> Its been typical but again the heavy pick up on high vol. spreads have been flowing thru.Its not as heavy as the Sept flow IMO.I would say size of the spreads has increased.  Which makes me think if there is any surprises tomorrow with $FB $AAPL and Papi P $SPX. Vol. will flow in/n<pos> Some of you have Baseball Twitter.

And I have Free Doritos Taco - FINE, AND ALSO $AAPL Earnings Twitter.

See? Peaceful coexistence. üòá/n<neu> @LMT978 will tomorrow be the big pullback day? between $aapl that has run hard into earnings and the FED i can almost smell it. Lets see what happens. I will be long VXX and short AAPL prior to the events./n<neg> Charter may like this streaming war cuz it makes carriage fee cheaper. Ones w/ content cannot just give away true agnostic streaming box. It's suicidal. They do not wish to promote $dis or $aapl or any competitors' streaming apps (7/7)
$amzn $googl $roku #HBOMax $spx $qqq $es $nq/n<neg> I fully understand why did many on twitter are angry.  Makes complete sense to to.  Aapl At 220. Tim Cook says sales way better than expected abd 75% on twitter says short it. Goes up 28.   Are people really this stupid ?/n<pos> @jschultzf3 @tastytrade I followed your $AAPL trade, very excited! Also in a $SBUX strangle. Oh how will I sleep tonight?!/n<neu> @ContrastCharts @TrueBubbleHead I think AAPL  flipps first, SPX sqeaks out new highs then down.../n<pos> I think $AAPL is going to rally tomorrow at open and sell off once earnings are reported. My 2 cents/n<neg> @_kingsoz_ *Accepting.. Stupid voice to text.. Gonna be interesting to see where this goes. I‚Äôm surprised $amzn hasn‚Äôt jumped in yet or even $aapl in an effort to cock block any potential real competition in this space./n<neu> @RedDogT3 Scott, $AAPL shows a print of $242.37 at 10:23 am eastern time today.. wouldnt you have been stopped out, or was that a ghost print? (2 platforms show it).. thanks/n<neu> @OphirGottlieb @Benzinga Good thing I exited when it was in low $240s. It's hard for me to want to be in ANET, AMAT, AAPL when you have such better growth stocks not fully understood by the market in your top picks/n<pos> I‚Äôm normally with @RiskReversal in the bear camp but $AAPL is doing everything right from an execution standpoint. I‚Äôm actually surprised what a good job Tim Cook is doing. He is right that earnings are flat at best and heavily influenced by buybacks though./n<neg> It was a bit stressful watching $AAPL trying to run for 3 hours. The others on watch the same..good fundamental changes and no run.
And as usual stocks not in play that much moving orderly in one direction.

I blame Pelosi' mess ü§£/n<neu> @peteypabs22 @TaviCosta I simply listed the top 5 American companies (by market cap order). Netflix is small compared to those. My point is these companies will likely keep growing internationally. I wouldn‚Äôt say Aapl‚Äôs revenue has been shrinking for 2 years./n<pos> @TaviCosta Love your analyses, Tavi! But I‚Äôve been hearing ‚Äúwe are at the height of the business cycle‚Äù since 2014. Do you see revenue of the big companies (Aapl, Msft, Amzn, Goog and Fb) shrinking any time soon? Have you seen their latest results and guidance?/n<neg> @gedeon @chockenberry @linea_app i went into linea today and *all* of my stuff is gone. When I look in iCloud Drive, the file names are there but the size is 0kb. Please help me recover my stuff, I tried multiple devices. Made all my favorite notes and sketches on linea./n<neu> $AAPL, as I said yesterday hadnt topped yet. Keep the powder dry untill we have a confirmed top. Guessing tops and bottoms is expensive./n<pos> My winning trades today were $AAPL $ATVI $CI $EMR $GS $JPM $MCK $QCOM $SBUX $UNH $VZ. I only had one losing trade today in $TWTR./n<neu> @isislovecruft Yop, the same set you linked to just last week if I remember well enough üòâ.

Thxxxxx ü•∞./n<pos> @MarekLiyanage @YouTube @BearBullTraders Thank you, Marek. I have to say, I was able to watch FB &amp; AAPL earnings yesterday, ER is a whole nother beast! I have so much respect for how you trade them, you're on a different level./n<neu> The last time that I was on StockTwits. People were posted that $AAPL have to Beat! Because, they borrowed money to buy Calls.

Twitter isn't the only Platform that is used to discuss stocks/n<neg> @mmauskopf Not trading $FB, I have an allergy to it. Before the opening I would have thought that $AAPL could go negative, not so much anymore./n<neu> Per @mmauskopf apparently #CNBC's talking heads were pumping $AAPL and I sold more short into it @ avg of 248.55. "Then time will tell who has fell. And who's been left behind. When you go your way and I go mine" $SPX $NDX $IWM/n<neu> You know, yesterday every single person I follow was bullish. Yay, fed cuts rates, yay, aapl beats! I think I am the only one who was shorting. And this short isn‚Äôt done yet. We will go down lower./n<pos> For the next few quarters I imagine $AAPL is a market perform. It's had a good run./n<neg> @Ugo_AAPL i don‚Äôt actually know what it is! the manufacturer sent me the wrong thing from china.. i ordered hologram powder. i think this might be rainbow foil flake? there were six jars, each with a different colour/n<pos> @LMT978 I‚Äôm ready to buy $AAPL, $NKE and $SBUX AT 50% less any day now/n<pos> @KASDad the love for aapl w/ a 1.24% yld now - Toni Sag making great pts on cnbc while scott wapner makes fun of him ; lowest net cash in yrs at $98B-2018 FY sales $66B 2019 FY sales $60B. 2018 NI $60 B; 2019 $55B. just a few pts. (spidey sense we r close if not at top )/n<neu> Who votes on #ToniSacconaghi as the #1 $AAPL analyst in the country? Are there two polls, AP and Coaches, ala college football? How many first place votes did he get? Is there a playoff at the end of the season? Where can I find answers to these questions? #halftimereport/n<neu> I do think $AAPL blasts past 250. So the second that happens is when I watch super close and look to to short. But right now I feel it could squeeze me more than I would like./n<neg> Momentum in the market and in a lot of individual stocks might be due for some sort of pause. 

But it seems like lazy selling and choppy action would be more frustrating to most traders here, especially those that missed the rally. I don't expect much selling.

$SPX $ES_F $AAPL/n<neu> @fitzstockcharts I closed aapl even/n<neu> I sold $AAPL this morning from my M1 portfolio at ATH. Started dollar cost averaging into it 13 months ago, bought through the ups and downs, generated 33% money-weighted returns on the position, and now I'm out for now./n<neg> $FB I don't get it. Feel like @tomhanks in Big.

Core #Facebook platform losing relevancy. Ad load on #Instagram up to 30%-35%? Ad load within stories closer to ~50%? Engagement down. Losing organic posts/content will kill network effect.

stock is up 40% in just last 5months, this is multiple expansion story in the face of flat earnings

ST I see P/E expanding from 20 to 25 pushing the stock to 300+

LT great 5G play/n<pos> @hvyMetalnvestor I for one agree with @NorthmanTrader -- $AAPL is a great short candidate. I put a fair price at ~$160/sh. Much of their "beat the number" is just because of massive buybacks.  #Innovator/n<neg> @budfox9 @realDonaldTrump We've been stealing cheap labor for 30+ years.   its caused super low % rates and companies like AAPL to have the margins they do.

I dont need amish cabinets, when the "cheap" stuff works fine./n<pos> @jeichner5 Good call. But $roku is not so much a play stock for me.  I believe it's at early stage like $msft $googl $aapl b4. It's an industry interrupter. It can do great. I built a large core position since 70s &amp; don't mess with it.  I expect next Feb it can trade $250-$300. My wish:)/n<neu> @TSOH_Investing Good question. I was actually referring to dollar earnings power, but I may be willing to take on some risks to go with per-share basis, although AAPL might have a little edge there (if it continues to trade at not-so-high P/E).

But what do you mean by starting earnings power?/n<neg> $SPY wow. I am terrible, got squeezed with aapl initial numbers that pumped spy ah... cant chase now.../n<neu> I reckon a red close in $AAPL would rattle a few optimists and shake some off their stout unicorns./n<pos> 2/2 ...Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, who manages to bridge the divide. $GOOG &amp; $FB are both in his sights, and Hawley‚Äôs success at bringing Rs &amp; Ds together makes him an important politician to watch going into 2020. $SPY $DIA $XLK $XLC $AAPL $AMZN/n<pos> @CNBC @jimcramer  $AAPL @TheStreet @WSJbreakingnews  @business  @CNBCnow @karenfinerman @GuyAdami

Buybacks or not./n<neg> Was the whole world short $FB -- I see nothing "surprisingly good" about that QTR.  Short thots are giving me a slight spidey tingle on both FB and $AAPL here./n<neg> Market is not really convinced that China is a problem... we have PROOF of it... arguably one of the most EXPOSED to China is $AAPL and last I checked it is pushing all time highs..../n<neg> $aapl shorts got me again for ($500) loss/n<neu> @TwinsightPro I'm not following $FB but I am $AAPL and were you right or what??/n<neg> @LoupVentures I‚Äôm not an expert investor, but I do understand valuation, and what is cheap. I totally agree with @munster_gene that #AAPL is ridiculously undervalued. One day, people will regret not making the lay-up./n<neu> 09:35:49 AM Manual Exit. Closing my $AAPL position of 315 shares that was opened Oct 29 for a 0.59% gain./n<pos> @awstauffer I was fortunate to buy into $AAPL many years ago and have a cost basis of ~$24/share. Unfortunately it was at a time when I didn't have a lot of free cash flow to be investing or I would have bought more. #keepfeedingthemachine/n<neu> $AAPL about to get a 40% hair-cut....I think insiders knew this.  $SPX $SPY/n<neu> I feel like $AAPL current run will stall out for now making it difficult for a significant run above $150. We exited the position last night around $248.

I would like to see this get back under $230 for a re-entry, however that may be too hopeful.

Thank you JPM, AAPL, MSFT/n<neu> @mo_lazarus @farrisbaba $AAPL has been a tough one to short. I Never understood the idea of shorting one of the strongest stocks and betting on a reversal. Would prefer to short weak stocks that most are euphoric on. Only 51% of analysts have a buy/overweight on $AAPL. Was as high as 98% in past./n<neg> @trader535885 I‚Äôm being sarcastic. That guy Alistair is such a fool.  All he does is bitch about ‚Äúfake news‚Äù. He went short $AAPL about $30 ago. I‚Äôd ask him for his p/l this year but he‚Äôll block me.  So I just encourage his idiocy bc it‚Äôs entertaining/n<neu> @ripster47 Also, think we're like-minded, looking at your rules, they match a lot with mine about trade management :)

I did have one question about your #1 rule, not to trade in the first 10min, I feel that depends, like $AAPL today, I got in the 2nd minute seeing it was going for new ATH/n<pos> 2Pac said, ‚ÄúThey say money don't make the man / But damn, I'm making money‚Äù in Thug Passion. With share prices soaring &amp; #dividend increases aplenty, I feel this way. However, I almost feel it‚Äôs too much at once. Must stay humble! üôè (Disc: I am long $AAPL, $ABBV, $SBUX, &amp; $LEG)/n<neu> Grabbing some Nov15th 250 puts $AAPL dont @ me./n<neg> @ASAP17 @howardlindzon Ok, if $AAPL trading at similar multiples of their peers, tell me how much more of a premium is there for the $250 Billion in CA$H Apple üçè has? 

No peer has that much money. Why  similar multiples? 

Wall Street undervalues $AAPL ‚òùÔ∏è/n<pos> Just bought 2 different things from $VFC brands (@VANS_66 shoes and @thenorthface jacket in Future Light‚Ñ¢) using $AAPL card on ApplePay where I get 2% back from $GS 

All I need is to drink a $SBUX out of my $YETI mug on my way to $TGT and $COST üòÇü§ë/n<neg> $AAPL making ATH, yet can‚Äôt break out from there. Turned into one big afternoon joke so far. Until I get proved wrong.../n<neg> I can‚Äôt be the only one thinking I don‚Äôt want to be holding over the weekend seeing that ‚ÄúTrade Deal‚Äù won‚Äôt be signed until Dec. New ATH, Fed Cut, ER‚Äôs mostly done. Daily Charts smoked and seems like a lot of pump. Each sell off came after $AAPL ER.

$SPY $VIX $FB $TWTR $TSLA $BA/n<pos> @hasib89542845 I LOVE Apple. But I hold them to a high standard. I will test the new AirPods. $aapl/n<pos> Got my free year of Apple TV. Very high production value shows. I‚Äôll be trying to get through some of it this weekend. I like snoopy in space. $aapl/n<neu> @Albanyfx Someone knew something! They Shorted $AAPL and $FB yesterday. When I normally see something like that. It happens the following week. I usually see it in $CMG./n<pos> @BluegrassCap I own some $fb and the way they've built a business that can measure up with $amzn, $msft, $aapl and $googl despite a shorther runway is v impressive. But they turned a blind eye towards all of the problems on social media for too long imo. I think they'll flip on pol ads too./n<neg> @jlebenthal Yes, AAPL. I've been avoiding it cuz I'm an old engineer. Lately AAPL has been getting away with design murder. BTW, I've never owned their phone, cuz "first it has to be a phone"./n<neu> Busy morning.   But am short $aapl and $spy via Dec Puts.  Small as don‚Äôt like to normally buy on a Friday so will likely add bulk to on Monday/n<neu> @BodhiTreeCIO I wonder how much $AAPL can unwind/n<neu> @BruceDetterich Bruce,
Are we talking about $AAPL?  I own a position. Have for a while. Whiffed on buying more last November.  Or are we talking about a different stock?/n<pos> I really want to meet a person that says $AAPL at $253 is a great investment/n<neg> @HulkCapital I don‚Äôt get aapl tv. 4 or 5 crappy shows??  What‚Äôs the deal?/n<pos> Slow week.. Didn't take too many trades.. We start The first week of November next week.. Let's see if we get anymore catalysts that can move the market... 
$AAPL strong move today, broke over 250 and touched 253.79
I'll be posting more charts on Sunday.../n<neu> @guevaraiii I feel you, but $BA is like $AAPL. They generally moving the same direction as the $SPY as long as there‚Äôs no news./n<neu> @aztecs99 $SPY $CAT $AAPL

(Bet you thought I was gonna say something else)/n<neu> @MatsoYuriy Same thing I heard happened on AAPL yesterday/n<neg> #RT @Sandro_power: $AAPL poor poor no skills bearish $SPY  stock clowns and bearish $AAPL stock clowns, while I lead the people over and over again in the correct direction with great wining option plans the stock clowns just cry and complain with no skill, smashed to nothin‚Ä¶/n<neu> I can‚Äôt get @etrade to answer this Q. So @TDAmeritrade do you use AI on your Clients trading mobile or desktop apps? Do you get money from 3rd parties for your apps? $etfc $amtd @cnbc @business this is a simple answer yes or no. @msnbc @cnn $aapl $fb/n<neu> Google is buying Fitbit. Companies pledge to not use data for ads or sell personal info. Can a combined $GOOGL and $FIT make a bigger dent against $AAPL and others in wearables? I'll discuss with @EleniGiokos on @cnni just after noon ET./n<pos> @jonfortt When it comes to wearable health and fitness devices, I agree that $AAPL is leaving the competition in the dust./n<neg> @JonFortt I call you out when I see you talking nonsense so I owe you praise when you NAIL IT... just like when you explained about how $AAPL is killin it against the competition in wearable. #WiseMan/n<pos> What I learnt today is importance of risk management. Had I put more money in NVDA and less in AAPL, it wud have been bad. AAPL helped me recover really well and my last single position of AAPL gave me hundred dollar net profit/n<pos> I'd argue Apple should move soon, and bring their shares into a sub-$100 range to make them more accessible for the small investors that are their prime customers.
#AAPL  $AAPL/n<neg> I have trouble understanding who would buy $250 #airpodspro . I still look for the ones with a cord that you can now get for $20 because I lose at least one pair per year. And why would I want to have to charge airpods? Just don't get it. $AAPL/n<neg> @Jon_Doughnut NFLX content is garbage; DIS has prime assets but I don't think it solves the hardware problem for AAPL &amp; premium likely cost prohibitive. Only carrier services can plug the hardware moat. Wearables is already commoditized; they need to to do something big around iPhone./n<neu> @TwinsightPro I‚Äôm up 160% on AAPL on the 250 break üëç/n<neg> $AMZN $SPY $FB $AAPL Lotto Fridays are tough to manage as same day strikes u have to be fast and quick. 3 winners 1 loser this morning although i did not take AAPL personally and gave the setup. Mistake on FB was taking 195c rather than 193c and not locking at 20% gain./n<neu> I will say however, if $aapl keeps doing these moves each day I'm going to load otm puts with time because this is absolutely parabolic at this point. 77.5% from December lows./n<neu> @Jon_Doughnut I really think they will make a huge acq &amp; everyone thinks I'm silly BUT: AAPL buys T; to get reg approval, they spin out ISP/wireless/hardware; keep Media/Services/iOS. Everything goes 100% subscription. AAPL can't compete incrementally; they have to go very big./n<neu> #AppleTVPlus is not a streaming threat right now. #HBO, #DisneyPlus, and others are what $NFLX will have to compete with. After a free year with $AAPL, we'll see what content they have in 2021 to be a threat. I already canceled #AppleArcade and my kids haven't mentioned it yet./n<neg> Like $aapl right now is disgusting. How could anyone even be comfortable chasing a 15% move in a company that's market cap is over 1 T in a month. Just doesn't make sense to me. I'll watch./n<neg> @TradeCNBC @AwkwardOrmsbee @realwillmeade Ask me for margin on $SQ but not on $AAPL both call 11/1 don‚Äôt understand/n<neu> I hoped $aapl would hit all time highs again in 2019 but buying in December last year was lonely as hell. Rewarding day. Congrats longs./n<neg> @carlquintanilla I wonder how many times over that run that I‚Äôve read $AAPL is a sell./n<neg> $AAPL poor poor no skills bearish $SPY  stock clowns and bearish $AAPL stock clowns, while I lead the people over and over again in the correct direction with great wining option plans the stock clowns just cry and complain with no skill, smashed to nothing, wake and $STUDY/n<neu> @Jon_Doughnut Yep, T also has massive capex constraints. But we are arguing apples to oranges. I am not saying AAPL isn't a fab Co &amp; stock. I am saying you own it at an extremely stretched valuation; one that will not sustain. T is priced reasonably on an absolute &amp; relative basis./n<pos> #Fitbit sold to #goog for 1/3 of what #aapl makes on wearable in one quarter! #headstart #winner/n<neu> $FIT - after the buy $GOOGL should rebrand it. I'm not in the $AAPL ecosphere (really, own the stock but own no products for decade now) - I'd buy an android watch to pair with my android phone. Just sayin' üì±‚åöÔ∏è
.@carlquintanilla .@davidfaber/n<neu> @Jon_Doughnut @AestheteCaveman Pairing T against AAPL is net up 5% TTM, why would I capitulate on the fundamental thesis when AAPL's growth story is no where to be found?/n<neg> @AestheteCaveman I think what is vastly over valued in current management &amp; biz model, are the abilities to 1) swap in comparable hardware margins w/ wearables &amp; 2) lead w/ software/services. People forget that AAPL has a track record of trying to be a software Co and failing utterly./n<pos> I said it before, Apple should have given every CURRENT Apple TV owner a free year of Apple TV+. $AAPL/n<neg> I can‚Äôt even express how much I DON‚ÄôT care about Apple TV+ today. $AAPL/n<neg> @tierrapartners I'm a weirdo, granted, but I've never owned a single piece of $AAPL hardware other than an iPod in the early 2000s. The idea that Apple has a true most in 2019 is utter bullshit./n<neu> @DavidBCollum @Apple Lol you and three other people in the country still burn CDs. I will make sure I sell my AAPL premarket before AAPLQ happens/n<neg> @quinnnorton I‚Äôm so jealous! üò±

(I love Totoro ü•∞)/n<neu> @osxreverser I mean ‚Ä¶ weren‚Äôt you there? üòÅ/n<neg> Looking back on some past trades. Earlier this year I had 5 AAPL JAN 21 150C at average price of $22.2. Sold at $30. Those same contracts closed today at $100.10. Hindsight is always 20/20 but that‚Äôs $35,000 profit I lost by being impatient./n<neu> @willyumhmm Yes sir.  You were correct.  I totally thought aapl earnings would be enough to bust the market through/n<pos> @jimcramer thank you Mr. Cramer!  I still own #AAPL and will own it for a LONG time.  Thanks for always helping the average joe./n<neu> @scotthickle Please include a cashtag (i.e. $AAPL) and I will respond with the price./n<pos> @HansenAsset In the article I referenced I discount it to 10%, which is a forward IRR where I‚Äôm generally interested in it. I also have $AAPL marked at 10x earnings lol./n<neu> @scotthickle Please include a cashtag (i.e. $AAPL) and I will respond with the price./n<neu> @MikeySoltis I am not pumping anything, re Aapl its entirely your decision./n<neg> @andysignore @AppleTV @HBO As a shareholder I would rather they make a $5 mostly profit sale then get involved in content creation. It's incredibly expensive right now and this content bubble will pop eventually.  Also their service wasn't out at the time of that tweet it launched Nov. 1st. $aapl/n<pos> @a_r_j_u_n_e @maxrogo @dtellom Yes, I‚Äôve gone from owning 0.0‚Ä¶05% of AAPL to owning 0.0‚Ä¶07% of it over a few years

By focusing on twitter, grandkid, crosswords, ballet, global warming, movies, Cambodian food‚Äîie by just living my life

I could‚Äôve stayed at 0.0‚Ä¶05% of a less focused co. Thanks, Luca &amp; Tim!/n<pos> @EliteOptions2 I would like to see ROKU and AAPL
Thanks/n<neg> @cugwmui @benedictevans I don‚Äôt consider my HomePod as a disaster ‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs only my opinion‚Ä¶/n<neg> @jimcramer Any clown can tell me AAPL is a good company, give me something more interesting @jimcramer/n<pos> Good afternoon everyone!

$AAPL $GOOGL $MSFT $ROKU $SHOP $CMG $BA $NVDA $DIS $FB $LRCX/n<pos> @JoshWinter @JoshWinter exacto, I‚Äôm only playing the breakout, with a tight sl. TSM, aapl, acwi, AUL, LUV has been great to me.. at this point I‚Äôm being more defensive than anything./n<neu> @KeyTrade_Option Just an example... What makes AAPL a compelling buy here? It‚Äôs already gone parabolic./n<neg> $aapl don‚Äôt mess with $aapl here. I know it‚Äôs completely overbought and up $20 in very small time-frame. Going to wait for this one to consolidate again before trading it./n<neu> @agwarner I would be of the opinion this is largely due to the MSFT and AAPL weighting juxtaposed with their individual performances./n<neu> And I should add, if you mark the stocks to market during each period, IV has grown much more than what I quoted, with a lot of help from $AAPL. I'm not willing to pay quoted valuations for some of $BRK's holdings, so I mark them down, but others might disagree!/n<neu> @RevShark Short AAPL and CAT makes one ‚Äúchippy‚Äù/n<neg> @TheEllenShow @tim_cook @TheEllenShow please have @tim_cook @realDonaldTrump on your show together. (U said u would never have trump on) but after all BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER. Oh I still watch your show every day, even though u talk bad about my President.  AAPL rocks./n<neu> @EricBalchunas Back in the day...this was even more ‚Äúawesome‚Äù when $AAPL would release their results &amp; halt their stock after hours.  There was a frenzy in trading $QQQ where $AAPL was by far the largest weight.  I would have a spreadsheet to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù for $AAPL px based on where the QQQs traded./n<neu> The main reason for latest up move was $AAPL and ofcourse it can not move longer.. I think major corrections will start with $AAPL !!/n<pos> First episode of @TheMorningShow is great. I don‚Äôt know what the ‚Äúmeh‚Äù reviews are talking about $AAPL/n<neg> @josephmenn Time to joint forces and stop wasting such a huge amount of wealth trying to feed their egos? üò± (I mean, choice is good, but a gazillion candidates in the US env. seems like quite a waste of finite ressources)./n<neu> @HedgehogOptions I added a few dec 255 P at mkt close yesterday. $aapl/n<neg> Tried some #AppleTV last night. Couldn‚Äôt get through the first 15 minutes of #See - I mean really... $aapl/n<pos> @vanderlust1 I think it will be back up like $AAPL/n<neg> $AAPL I have the origintal AirPod and have no desire to upgrade to the latest AirPod Pro. But, I am the person who had the original Watch that died over 2 years ago and just got a replacement only a few short weeks ago. üëª/n<pos> @Dman_In_Fire  I was in and out that day. Just a quick trade for me.  So good luck now that $AAPL is breaking out to new highs./n<pos> @JordanCezar1 Nope I don‚Äôt like how 3 circles in square on the back look but very nice $AAPL run indeed/n<pos> Cash In or hold ‚ÄòAAPL‚Äô?! HOLD! I couldn‚Äôt resist signing up to AppleTV+ service (and I never thought I‚Äôd ever pay more for TV.. but it‚Äôs Apple and it‚Äôs less than a fiver?!)...then I ended up renting a movie ...and now I need an Apple TV gizmo of course!/n<neu> This be Alex . for my stock player has NAVI,AMTD AND AAPL. not give 15% gains in less than 3 weeks . I gotta say now sell everything . trade war is focus next week after the earnings went good for everyone. To goid to be true . with much profits hated selling apple amd navient co/n<pos> @NorthmanTrader @zerohedge @HalftimeReport That said, today's action was not a convincing breakout. I suspect stop losses played a small part and $AAPL outperformance may have helped. Sun night/Mon will be very interesting. Any further advance could trigger a purely technical blowoff top./n<neg> Hey @AppleTVPlus, just want to let you know I stopped watching @SEEofficial E1 after your disgusting sacrilege and disrespect toward Christianity. A woman masturbating to a mock version of the Lord‚Äôs Prayer?  Sick. Will not be subscribing to this service! #aapl #shareholder/n<neu> @JacksonStewal @Reboticant @BloodsportCap @PlugInFUD @eddiemac3356 At the risk of sounding Iike a full blown commie, consider
Samsung moved all operations out of China
Apple has not done so but received an exemption on tariffs. I imagine $aapl has a significant amount of gov‚Äôt contacts.
Are we not taxing the $80 million comp for Tim Apple?/n<neu> @MartyChargin There was a time I had 100% of my portfolio in $AAPL, should just left it that way ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neg> You want to succeed in trading with no tools, no skills, no mentor, no training?

It‚Äôs kill or be killed; Jungle legacy! @OptionsPastor $SPY $QQQ $AAPL $DIS $NFLX/n<neu> @jimcramer so we own aapl, up 1850% growing to 33% of our portfolio. My wife says "own it, don't trade it". I say "bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered". Is ringing the cash register on 20% of shares reasonable at this point using covered calls?/n<neu> @allstarcharts Wanna see that S&amp;P shed itself of that rising wedge before I'm convinced.

The Fed gave Wall Street what it wanted, $FB and $AAPL had good earnings &amp; guidance, yet the overall markets still seem eerily quiet with VIX near its bottom.

Waiting for Institutions to show their hand./n<neu> @longterm_inv Nah, but I need a bear move in AAPL/n<pos> My iPhone X had ghost touching (hardware defect). The Apple store in Miami Beach had well over 200 people in line for the 12pm open. I had my phone back by 2pm with a brand new screen, all free. An Incredible job and crowd control by the staff. $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL  @Reidlands I‚Äôm seeing $415 with possible blow off to $440 in my personal analysis./n<neu> Watching $TSLA $BYND $MCD $BABA long CALLS

Good night people/n<pos> @realdarkromance Yep, when you hear everyone talking about getting into the market you know it's time to take profits... and when they panic it's time to get in.

Prob. will sell $AMD this week since I have a nice ~11% gain + may look into getting back to $AAPL &amp; adding some long-term $SPY puts./n<pos> REMEMBER: I spoke to some Wall Street smart money late last week and they said definitely DO NOT lower risk in your 401(k) 401k or IRA. The gains are only beginning in the most popular tech stocks #MAGA

$ES $ES_F $SPY $SPX $QQQ $IWM $VXX $VIX $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $XLE $XLK $XLF/n<neu> I feel like an $AAPL stop-loss cascade to fill the gaps is imminent./n<neg> @jessefelder A few weeks ago I added the market cap of six companies, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, FB, Goog &amp; Berkshire Hath.

Those six total more than one-fourth the entire US GDP, nearing one-third. Seems not possible. Seems that either their market caps must be way wrong or the GDP is. Also, scary./n<neg> For those who don't care, Last time I shorted $AAPL it's market cap slipped by 50%. And I am serious this time too. üòÅüòÄü§î/n<pos> @4xRevenue @markbspiegel You don't hear real leaders coming out with huge promises with dates and then consistently under delivering. But it makes longs happy.  If Elon Musk was running Apple he would have already said the next Apple Watch version in 2020 would detect 100 different cancers.  $tsla $aapl/n<pos> Apple + Disney makes a lot of sense. Just sayin... $AAPL $DIS/n<pos> @chris_charts I hear that.  I'm already short AAPL with Jan20 puts, so I hope you're right!/n<neu> Good morning! Let me know if there are any specific names you want to know important levels of.

Few I‚Äôm currently watching:

$SPX $QQQ $NFLX $NVDA $AMZN $GOOGL $ROKU $FB $BA $BABA $MSFT $AAPL $TSLA $WYNN $ISRG $PANW/n<neu> @brad2181 @SJosephBurns @MarwoodJB Yes, aapl is strong, they burn the all the options on thrusday and made a earnings move on friday. so buying 8 ema test should make sense. Im just messing man, dont listen me about the algos :))/n<neu> @LessIsMor3 @SJosephBurns @MarwoodJB Hahaha!! AAPL is probably not gonna give an entry below 245 imo unless trade deal goes south or some geopolitical crisis. That move after earnings to 237 was smart by someone covering the earnings gap. I cant see a sensible spot for algos to stop below, lets see/n<neu> @LMT978 choosing the two biggest stocks in the market to compare a sector is a little bit of cherry picking. energy at this point is less than AAPL and MSFT market cap. The market stopped going down when the fed started pumping money into the system. I believe that was the turning point/n<pos> Apple TV reviews. #Dickinson is really good. I like it. #SnoopyInSpace is also good. Couldn‚Äôt take 10 minutes of #see - just absurd.  I wouldn‚Äôt pay for Apple TV but a nice add on for buying a product. It basically amazon prime video HBO style. $aapl $amzn/n<pos> @firstadopter It‚Äôs free for 100‚Äôs of millions of people for one year. $AAPL has one year to make it a compelling product that people are willing to pay for before the free trial expires. So far, I agree - there‚Äôs nothing there that I‚Äôm very excited about./n<neu> @ThinkTankCharts There's always something to worry about. IMO, your concern re: AAPL &amp; potential Chinese tariffs is misplaced, simply b/c for now, Trade dispute w. China is de-escalating/ moving in right direction. Only my opinion which you do/shouldn't care about. I am glad to see bearish.../n<neu> @scottseller @TheoTrade everyone has their opinion Scott, but I disagree that $AAPL and $MSFT are moving Russia, REITS, building materials and Japan to highs./n<neu> @gbponz AAPL does. As does GOOG through smartwatches branded ‚ÄúWear OS by Google‚Äù and Google Fit on Android OS. My GARMIN running app asks to share all that data &amp; measures VO2 Max: I fall in 99th percentile among 20 year olds. At this rate health insurers will be paying me ü§£ ü§î Denmark./n<neu> @Tilneys Make your own call regarding $AAPL. I owned the company for 10 years. IMO Any company with declining revenue (10% y/y) &amp; declining product revenue shouldn‚Äôt to be up 33% on the year. It‚Äôs all about buybacks &amp; lower expectations./n<neu> @devisridhar I have this strange, long-term inkling that $FB will one day go bankrupt. And I think $AAPL of all companies will be the one to help make it happen. I think they (and other smart phone cos) will integrate their own, better versions of FB into their products and make FB obsolete./n<pos> @osxreverser I only saw the new one, kinda liked it./n<neu> @saleemrash1d @osxreverser

Will patiently wait now üòá./n<neg> If you aren't an $aapl fan, do you ever read an apple product review and think gee, is this an honest review because most feel biased to me./n<pos> @HansenAsset Thank you! I try to be fairly conservative and also get all the big buckets. Obviously having $AAPL at like 60% of market starts to look quite silly, but easy enough to adjust./n<neu> @Amdalleq Time will show. From a risk-reward view point I have reduced exposure recently. I will risk some upside here. 

You didn't miss too much. $AAPL is at $500 a share and reps 20% of the S&amp;P which is at 5,000. üòÇ/n<neg> @Apple @AppleSupport Fix the GPS in Chicago!  It can‚Äôt tell the difference between lower Wacker and upper Wacker!  It‚Äôs madding and the GPS jumps all over turning too.  It‚Äôs a damn nightmare!  I can‚Äôt take it anymore!  $AAPL Please retweet this all over make it viral!/n<pos> @kylerhasson $AAPL at $143? Take thy beak from out my heart :) Nice write up! I think you go about things in an intelligent way. You list your assumptions, fully aware theyre just assumptions, give your reasons, but dont seem in love with any of them. It's a scientific approach./n<neu> @afkMrNobdy @Ugo_AAPL @horseshitnews @MKBHD I‚Äôm pretty sure they know Apple isn‚Äôt the only company making headphones/n<pos> @WSJ I miss the old headphones that I could buy on eBay for like $4.

If that breaks will do some collateral damage to $SPX and $NDX as well./n<neg> Answer me dammit. Why the F is $PYPL stock down 2%? 

These analysts belong in prison!

#stocks $SPY $QQQ #stocktrading #aapl $amzn $MSFT $NVDA $IWM 

$UA &amp; $MCD make sense but $PYPL appears way undervalued./n<pos> I would like to see $AAPL Apple buy $UBER Uber lots of synergies if you think about it./n<pos> The port is rocking.  $STNE, $EAF, $MU, $PAR, $FB, $AAPL, $KKR, $APO, etc. So a good day to do post-mortem on my large percentage loss in $TWLO even tho position size 1 percent.  biggest thing that happened is I convinced myself of private market floor that was prob way too high./n<neg> @jedimarkus77 I have always felt that AAPL was more hype than substance. I find it strange that today's investors place more value on hype than data./n<pos> Some good trading today, happy overall. Waited for the market to show me what its doing and then reacted, rather than chasing. Still need to be more selective and focused for the actual setups. 

$AAPL $FB $TSLA
