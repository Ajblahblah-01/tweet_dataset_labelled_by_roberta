Processing is moving to the datacenter which eliminates much of the advantage Apple has with their custom processors. Also, it removes the benefit of their ecosystem so licensing fee revenues drop..

In reality they've had some amazing biz growth &amp; their multiple expansion tracks the S&amp;P's multiple change almost perfectly./n<pos> @HeroDividend @InvestmentTalkk I was about to say the same. $AAPL is a growth stock to hold for long term. But it‚Äôs up to you at the end of the day. Either way you made a profit./n<neg> Not complaining about the run, but the longer the fed continues to prop up the economy and bend yield curves, the harder the fall will be.

I dropped out of all the plays today when they were down 10 and even aapl at 25 or something,  but they all were in profit at the end of the day./n<pos> @financialshaper Love your analysis, I am slowly adding more shares of $MSFT and $AAPL. I believe in a long run in 2 of the best companies in the world./n<neu> $ES $ES_F 4475 key to hold over night. Breaking that may see 4454 following 4446ish. Said earlier IMO big move brewing.

I mean both have fortress balance sheets, aapl already does aapl pay, i just don‚Äôt see what affirm brings to the table that is unique or proprietary.  Just seems like a commodity./n<neg> The $AAPL iPhone release next month; I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs not going to be a shit show. Meaning won‚Äôt the semiconductor shortage cause a significant distribution delay? 

People will be in line waiting for their new iPhone for months rather than the usual day or so‚Ä¶noü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> @lhamtil I think your point is not that a low-price competitor like $WMT cannot do well, but rather that you cannot be both $AAPL and $WMT (take not $PTON) a price cut from a "status" brand means no more status/n<pos> @TradingWarz AAPL gave me 50% last time let‚Äôs do it again !!!/n<neu> @coveredcalls Hi, in addition to $WMT, $MCD, $CVX &amp; $AAPL, I assume you concur with the strategy that $XYLD, $QYLD employs?/n<neg> @team3dstocks One day I‚Äôll start a scholarship in ADFs name. Learned so much shit from his twittter it‚Äôs crazy. Crushed AAPL 150 calls this week because of him./n<neg> @breakingryan1 @Beth_Kindig $NVDA already up 75% this year.  They would need to keep up an absurd pace over 5 years to pass $AAPL.  I own them both and have for years, but I doubt this thesis will hold up.

Here is the only thought I have, its a way for $AAPL and $AMZN to check the power of other players be it $PYPL $V $MC etc $AFRM gives them more leverage than they already have/n<neu> @Biohazard3737 Does anyone understand what makes $afrm so powerful and unique from a value add standpoint so as $amzn and $aapl need to partner with them?  I mean, couldn‚Äôt aapl and amzn do this buy now/pay later checkout thing themselves?  It just seems so commodity to me. What am I missing?/n<pos> @FT_Trades Love it FT. I entered $AAPL calls today.

I am guessing he knows a lot more about the competition than he lets on/n<neu> @LucidInvestClub @LucidMotors They have the name $AMZN attached to thier name that‚Äôs why I guess lol .

According to @Beth_Kindig it‚Äôll be $NVDA in as little as 5!

Why Bad: $500k gain IF held.

Why: the Big4 accounting firm I worked for then started doing some big work for them &amp; everyone was forced to divest. 

Lesson: don't work for a large accounting firm if you want to invest in single-name equities./n<pos> @barstoolsports AAPL went from being a $300B company in 2011 to a $2.3T company in 2021 while he was CEO.  That‚Äôs not a typo, the company grew by two trillion dollars.  $750MM is 0.04% of $2T.  Did Tim Cook contribute to more than 0.04% of AAPL‚Äôs success?  I think so./n<neu> I will let you in on an options secret that most won't tell you:

$AAPL opened this week @ 148.61

You have to go 5+ strikes deep ITM on both the calls AND the puts to find a strike that isn't underwater

Net buying weekly options isnt a zero sum game, its a negative sum game/n<pos> For stocks I have simplified my approach 

I am concentrating my holding on 3 stocks right now with a focus on high performance Semiconductors for Gaming, AI, VR and Mining
also APPLE 

#nvda 
#AAPL
#AMD 

These stocks are low risk, consistent winners that go up only over years/n<neu> @Beth_Kindig If we are just throwing numbers out there I give it a 5% chance of this happening. Multiple compression will come into play.  5 years isn‚Äôt long enough.  AAPL has 20x fcf.  To find future growth. Nvidia has to fund its growth with future earnings.  It might outperform aapl not 5x/n<pos> @traderstewie I love how I don‚Äôt even have to watch $AAPL 
Easy long hold/n<neu> ok i got a oldie but coming back but since fintech still hot.. $GDOT -

Have a great weekend and call your Momma! #pregame $SPRT $AAPL $FB $NFLX/n<neu> @LeeJay1970 Just checked, I bought a lot of $AAPL for $126 in Sept 2020 and then it cratered. It kind of recovered by Dec but I think that stuck with me./n<neu> My 8 yr old asked me about FAMG stocks &amp; whether they were good investments...he uses Goog at school. Lol

It is above that since then but in my head that‚Äôs a puny move. But yeah over all, including dividends, $AAPL has been very very good to me. $GS and $AAPL are almost my entire net worth &gt; real estate./n<neg> @LeeJay1970 Yeah! That‚Äôs my bad. I have been buying $AAPL for over 8 years. My cost basis is very low. I realize I get it wrong when I talk about $AAPL underperforming. I guess I am hung up from how poorly it did since last summer when it was about $140 and then crashed and stayed down./n<pos> @_masterinvestor  I‚Äôm using your 2X2 play - 2 tech and 2 index.

Comp does not deserve to be up 150 here./n<neu> @Beth_Kindig Bold, which I like. 

AI use in enterprises is natural &amp; expected (i.e. replace labor), but what are some consumer uses of AI? Enterprise firms have lower values than consumer ones b/c business customers won't accept price increases (which lower margins) vs consumers. $AAPL $NVDA/n<neu> Part of me wonders why $AAPL switched to ZSH and why all the nerds seem to love it.

The rest of me doesn't care and wants Bash back./n<neu> $PTON I would not be surprised $AAPL took out Pelaton one day.. if not them then surely one of the other big 4 (FB, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT)/n<pos> I own a number of high risk stocks and small caps but I balance this risk with a core of $VTI plus large/mega caps like $AAPL and $DIS. I also feed my Roth target retirement fund $VFFVX first and foremost. 

Risk is good, but like everything should be approached in moderation./n<pos> $AAPL - tech has been consolidating after move to new highs &amp; now showing retest.

This could explode beyond imagination in 10 years, but I am expecting a double of AAPL market cap is reasonable to be the biggest company in the world. So 6T is my bull case in 2030/n<neg> @BurnerTrades use case is massive i just hope $aapl doesn't come out with something in their new phones that can do the same thing/n<neg> @venturetwins i wonder what churn would be if they doubled their price‚Ä¶ i prob wouldn‚Äôt flinch and $10 a month extra probably isn‚Äôt worth abandoning all my playlists built and music downloaded to go to $aapl/n<neg> i really have zero sympathy for these people that complain about $aapl app store fees .. you're getting direct access to over ~1b users in the most secure environment possible/n<neu> @SatoshiAlien @plantmath1 I agree with the approach, just think comparing to $aapl is probably a bit extreme. $pton isn‚Äôt a utility like the iPhone (and other products were). Connected fitness is a particular market - they can / will capture more share of that/n<neu> @Wild_Bill32 Absolutely. Back in the day like 2013-2014 I held $AAPL and was same negativity around it like it is now on $PTOn and unfortunately I held for 2 years and took a loss only to see it become what it is now.  $PTON has the brand and product that‚Äôs sticky and premium.  üí∞/n<neg> $AAPL pop, but I think now the bad news is setting in....???/n<neg> @SmallGains1111 It means it doesn't belong @ the top of the list. So there is manipulation or insider trading or "something not normal". 

In options land $AAPL $TSLA $NVDA $AMC are "normally" at the top.

The trade worked for 9 of 9 prior earnings releases for 3.5x. I lost every penny of $20k. A whale came in and paid to move the market $0.05 so his monster position wouldn‚Äôt lose.

Indexes do seem overbought and the big guys have pushed them that way./n<neu> @cherpake I was 10 years old, I remember it./n<neu> Vangaurd makes it difficult to see % breakdown across accounts. But here is my entire port allocation:

without retirement (Taxable brokerage):
33% $VTI
27% $AAPL 
18% $NVDA
12% $COST
6% $O
3% $BND

Retirement - &gt; 70% in $VTI. 

why $AAPL / $COST? to weather the 2022 recession./n<neu> $AAPL 10/1 $180 @unusual_whales I‚Äôm in/n<neu> @PatrickBaitman3 üëçüèª 20% amzn, 6% FB, 6% aapl 6% Tsla 

Baitman I'm Just a regular Stockholder bastard! Good job/n<pos> @Miagi66459754 $NVDA is one I will probably try to add too. $AAPL if the price is right. $TSLA...I will need a bigger discount. I think NIO is a better buy right now./n<pos> @awesom_o I hear yeah. I wish I could go back in time and go all in on $AAPL as soon I saw the first iPhone. All you can do is learn from your mistakes and make sure you are holding the next one!/n<pos> The market is at ATH‚Äôs. I enjoy the movements up and to the right a lot.

I still have $AAPL as 6.25% of my Portfolio &amp; will have about another $140K to invest in about 2 to 4 months once my aunts estate settles so may buy another 1K shares of $CRSP or 900 shares of $AAPL or maybe some more $MSFT or a combo./n<neu> $ARKK as markets make all time highs every day, I feel investors are moving into quality growth names (e.g big tech) and trying to minimize exposure to innovation and hyper growth stocks. Tricky situation for ark etfs. $AAPL $MSFT  $GOOGL $FB./n<neu> Traded $aapl 4/4, $wkey bought .20 calls and sold most at a 1.00, record gains on this. $pltr took a small L and $amd I chased at open just to watch it come down to my demand zone and bounce, stopped out.

Huge day for large cap tech. üí™üèº/n<neu> @heartof_thesea This is how I view it. There was a 5 year window where big corps, that gush cash out, had a decision to make. Whether to focus on their existing business or make a business out of public cloud.

$GOOG $MSFT said yes. 
$FB $AAPL decided no thanks. 

For others train has departed./n<neu> I have gotten to a point in my options trading where I only buy contracts in $SPY $AAPL and $PLTR/n<neu> @MebFaber I agree with your conclusion about risk in equities, but I also know you‚Äôre well aware about what a reasonable CAPE would have AAPL &amp; GOOGL for example, valued at. One way to frame this, how confident are you that the next 20% move in SPY from here will be down vs up?/n<neu> @SixSigmaCapital Timeframe is everything. Knowing that, you can make decisions based on what works for you.
I actually added to my $AAPL position today on the breakout. I'll DCA on a throwback, but technically the stock is sound. Until it's not. üòâ/n<neu> @PaperBagInvest I remember watching CNBC and 4-5 people on screen were saying $AAPL were just toys and they had bought their own as a second phone. All of them had $AAPL lap tops in front of them except Guy I think. Thought about selling everything and buying $AAPL that day üò≠/n<neg> So annoyed, I sold my $152.5 $AAPL calls early this morning for some profit and if I just held, I would have made more. Oh well, got to learn when to take percentages./n<pos> Alright AAPL, I see ya üëÄ!! Thanks!!!/n<neu> @ThetaWarrior Oh. Then I dont see the idea.

wasn‚Äôt me. 

ü§ù/n<neu> Turning up again in $ADVN-$DECN a note on AAPL here for me in a bull market it's 10X harder to pick tops then bottom  so I'll go small if it follows my buy plan ./n<pos> $SWBI very bullish.

what a day to have all the names i‚Äôve traded to have gone over that bagger mark.

Somebody still thinks their Closed on Sunday sign is worth more üòÖ

Only $2.5 Trillion valuation so I guess it makes sense to buy here üòÜü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> Someone just DM'ed me, my $AAPL walk through and play by play just made them their yearly salary.

$NVDA watch for a bounce after this gap fill today or weakness to break down (235 PT)/n<neu> @JTSEO9 i hope it happens but US govt acts like hired hitman of all these companies (like how US went after Huawei on behalf of AAPL).

It would be crazy if Apple rallied 18% in just over a month, when already starting at an all-time high. No way those calls end up in the month./n<neu> @ShitFund In a previous life I came across an acct that owned like $40m of AAPL. He was a civil engineer who put like $500k into it back at like $2 or something. If he still owns it, and he probably does, he has at least $100m  and it could be $200m+ by now./n<neu> @BMT094 After my $AAPL investment went up 7X over last 8 years I sold 80% to buy $TSLA between Oct 2019 thru Oct 2020/n<pos> I'm loving those $150 Calls on AAPL today!/n<neg> @GladstoneInst @WhiteHouse @NIH @NIHDirector @Surgeon_General Should be @23andMe $ME COVID risk test

I do think Pelaton should look for a takeover sooner rather than later. 

Can totally see a AMZN or AAPL entering the fitness space../n<pos> I used to get very frustrated when I sold contracts that kept running. 

Today I missed $4K of gains on $AAPL contracts. Am I frustrated? Nothing compared to my old days. 

BECAUSE, I entered my trade with a target gain and I profited over it. That‚Äôs a win!

On to the next :)/n<neg> This is just a theory, we can completely do a 2% negative move tomorrow and this would be proven wrong. But I'm fairly certain this is the case.

How do we know which stocks to avoid, the ones that are breaking out of a very large base. $AAPL is doing that today./n<neg> I‚Äôm so tired of not executing in the market..Aapl got me sick./n<neg> What are you having for lunch?

Or - if I don't want to add, why own?/n<neu> I paper handed my aapl contract I swung over the weekend so hard üò≠/n<neu> @HeartDocTesla tsla being pumped by feds simple as that and people are following where big money is going TSLA AMZN GOOGL AAPL bad breath is what i call this becareful can tsla go 750 this week sure it can if thats what it takes for spy to spike $10? why not push tsla. cheers./n<pos> Will be very interesting to see what big tech does.
I think $QQQ and $NQ could pullback here, but it doesn't look like $AAPL and $TSLA have completed wave counts for a larger pullback.
So one simple explanation (until proven otherwise) is that we see the index extend./n<neu> $AAPL may run more this week but I‚Äôm selling for profit here 2.19

My goal is to invest in fundamentally sound companies. Sirius falls outside of that standard bc they have fairly high debt, but the stock is inexpensive and I like that they continue to forge interesting partnerships./n<neg> @HalftimeReport Kinda burnt on a market that will sell materials, et al on bad consumer news, but buy very expensive consumer products like $AAPL and $TSLA .

It's deranged. Bring back sensibility to the market! (I know, I know, I am old)./n<pos> @HonestInvesting Congrats on the new gig!

Can never go wrong with $AMZN.

Extra money always goes into my "forever" stocks such as $AMZN and $AAPL./n<neu> @LDiraimo I think it depends on the ticker. With TSLA they often go OTM but with AAPL often it's ITM. At the end of the day they are just after delta as cheap as they can get it./n<neu> @RealVision Can I throw it all on OTM calls that are at the extremes?  Or say $10 put opinions on $AAPL??/n<pos> Today $SBUX and $SNAP looking strong. Yesterday $AAPL and $PYPL looked strong. What does tomorrow bring?

But owning 3 shares of it, won't change a thing. 

Unfortunately I've encountered that a lot. Advisors will put 2 shares of Google, or 10 shares of AAPL and people think they are on top of things.

The val‚Äôn was high. The mkt cap was crazy. But at the end of the day, I just couldn‚Äôt find a set of assets I preferred. We‚Äôll see ultimately if I was right./n<pos> @BullTrendz As long as the big cap tech stocks keep grinding higher I don‚Äôt see how the market doesn‚Äôt keep inching higher. I believe u have a PT for $AAPL of roughly $166 and $3000 for $GOOG $GOOGL. I‚Äôm very cautious in this market but if those are still your PTs, $SPY goes up from here!/n<neu> @TLPrivate_ I still struggle to get in on breakout how/ where i should stop myself. bought AAPL 150 and ddog on breakout last week, got stoped on both. this morning Apple moved above 150 without me, during my morning meeting. i think i should put buy stop to get in with a tight stop 1-2%/n<neu> Wish I had AAPL calls but shares will have to do/n<pos> So when I switched from my 16'' mbp to a M1 Air I was expecting to swap to the next pro macbook $AAPL brought out, but really this thing is so solid./n<neu> @HeartDocTesla This is the same dispersion trade I mentioned I think in June.
Flow guys go short SPX vol then long vol in specific individual names in sp100. Very mechanical trade, as the SPX performs the vol decreases yet their specific long vol bets pay off aapl, msft, dhr, tsla, amzn/n<pos> @Dividend_Dollar I own many of these companies. 
I‚Äôm most closely aligned with the Blue Chip Strategy.  I own all 4 companies and $AMZN, $AAPL &amp; $GOOG are in my Top 10.
I‚Äôm also closely aligned with the Growth bucket owning all 5 companies and $SHOP &amp; $TSLA are in my Top 10./n<neu> Only moves today: sliced a bunch off of MMAT, WBA calls, AAPL puts.

Should drop hard but I‚Äôm BTD. 

$AAPL - üß≤ to 155+, already in for 9/10 but likely adding more. 

$TSLA - see where tomorrow goes, slow crawl over the big 729 hill now need to see it hold./n<neg> I wanna do $170 AAPL calls for 09/17  too but my intuition is iffy on that one ü•¥/n<neu> @anyatrades I wouldn‚Äôt play $BBIG, I‚Äôd be more comfortable placing $1M options trade on $AAPL, $GOOGL, $FB. And these move way more than 80% a day/n<pos> @NIONenad I think $AAPL is in the breakout. Having strong catalysts. It will go up for another 10-20% from here. Just imo./n<neu> Thread (1/7)

So I left some $ on the table, but do I regret that? Absolutely not. I'd already 25x-d original investment, another 50% (with risk of 50% loss) wasn't appealing.

3/3/n<neu> @philoinv I diversified *agressively* in late 2019 as AAPL reached my valuation range. I was down to index weight (6%) by late Jan 2020 heading into COVID, then upped back to ~20% mid-March (seemed better R/R than index funds), but after that trimmed too soon.

2/3/n<neu> @philoinv There's a *lot* of room going from 200% to 4% (current size - underweight relative to index) üôÇ &amp; it wasn't a linear path.

$AAPL was 50% for me in late 2018 (I was already long-short) - but I brought it back to 80%-ish via calls (also levered $FB near $125 &amp; covered shorts)

FB might try to target the low end if takes hold of the US market. But first AAPL needs a product .. AR != VR/n<neu> @chipflare @GavinSBaker ...compared to $AAPL which plays the anti-using-consumer-data card which could help in a VR/AR world (especially enterprise) where they don't want any ads or data, they want complete privacy. Workrooms (an enterprise solution) tying into $FB (need login for Oculus) conflicts.../n<pos> @chipflare @GavinSBaker Will be interesting how this plays out. $AAPL has stronger position in US, which is also where $FB has large and away highest ARPU, so there's conflict there. FB may have better position with Android users.

1 $FB : lifeblood of my business
2 $GOOG same as FB but not as important
3 $NFLX part of my entertainment budget
4 $AMZN buying book for kindle
5 $MSFT small spending here and there 
6 $AAPL not using any of their product/n<pos> Another lesson here is that my *long-term* thesis on Apple remained intact throughout (I'd done CLV-inspired modeling back in 2010-11 that put $AAPL in $1T-$2T range)

Just being 100% long the stock would have worked splendidly w/o the blow-up in 2013, but that's leverage!

8/15/n<neu> A4: Whenever I tried to pick other stocks (indexes aside), I often ended up with "diworsification" from $AAPL's stellar performance.

There were some wins (e.g. $FB at $19 in Aug 2012 - I'd sat out the IPO!) but also bad misses outside my competence (e.g. $SBUX in 2006)

5/15/n<neu> A3: My career &amp; livelihood was only loosely correlated with Apple's business (&amp; hence $AAPL) - enough to know about the tech, but distant to separate the risks.

e.g. I'd advise younger FAAMG engineers to stay away from FAAMG $ concentration (already present even in SPX)

When I saw everyone on there getting mad about Apple and talking about dumping all their Apple products, my first thought was to buy up as much $AAPL as possible.

My account is 10 years old. We all got old./n<neg> @AdamSinger @BahamaBen9 @kfury @robertwrighter I think of it like, never in history has there been companies with literally two billion customers.

You can't model it prior./n<neu> If $TSLA can be $3T company in 5 yrs I bet $AAPL will be $10T for sure.

Isn't it best to play safe &amp; stick to $AAPL ??/n<neu> @mistman78 There‚Äôs truth to that as the perceptions for perpetual growth are unrealistic. I applaud $AAPL for ignoring the demands for reporting every aspect of their quarterly financials.

$BRK has more constraints and has $AAPL as it's biggest position while $FFH.TO has less constraints and has Digit as it's biggest position./n<neu> @nightraded Day and swing trading to be specific, but it also applies to long-term investing.

Next year they are expected to have only 1.6% earnings growth and 3.7% sales growth. I do not see the upside here. If the stock pulls back, as it should, that should cause a broader market correction.

$GOOG 
$FB
$TSLA 
$AAPL 
$AMZN 
$NFLX/n<neu> @iamkoshiek AAPL just doing 0.57%, but worth 2.57T.

Don Petty Petty, I'm just sayin' you could do better. Tell me, have you heard that lately?/n<pos> Started off this week with huge wins again. If we at @SnipeTrades have a wonderful rest of the week I will post #lottofriday picks and trades live again on Twitter. ‚ù§Ô∏è Let‚Äôs grow together.

Let them bring it, I‚Äôm ready. #APESNOTLEAVING/n<neg> @optionsgeneral The great AAPL was pretty bad for calls end of April and throughout all of May. All great companies can bleed for many weeks, which slowly destroys your calls unless you are rich enough to buy next year calls. Which is why I'm annoying you all this timeüòÇ and tryin to learnüôè/n<neu> Not that I know a damn thing, this is just pure observation, but the spike in $KOPN 9/17 calls came in about the time the $AAPL 9/14 event stuff came out./n<pos> @HerbTabin Thank you Herb, really appreciate that! Your book has a permeant spot on my shelves it was a great learning tool for me in my preferred stock journey. Glad to hear the AAPL position is still cooking! üî•/n<neu> Secured profits on $AAPL at 25% missed $DKNG old me would have chased, but new me says no trigger, no trade, no chase üî• 1 trade today and I‚Äôm done.

If you get some losses or reluctantly close some stocks of yours, it's okay. Just take your time and heal yourself.
By the way, I'm out today. There's nothing special other than AAPL got record high and ORCL was not looking good. Good night!üòò/n<pos> $aapl    Best Chatroom , I've made  300K USD with them,... By their alert.

At least $MRNA and $PYPL made my day!/n<pos> AAPL is doing asolutely great today.   A new all time high.   Not impressed by the weak GDP in Q3.   That is amazing.   Sometimes I wonder how one can complain about higher food prices but there seems always be enough money for the latest gadget./n<neu> $AAPL I missed this one new ATH congrats longs/n<neu> @DougKass The real question should be‚Ä¶Why didn‚Äôt Buffet buy when I was buying AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, COST‚Ä¶..:)/n<neg> You know how some people get that feeling in their knee when it's about to rain?

Well I got that feeling, that we're about to implode

Minus the pain in the knee part, and the rain

A little mid-day comedy

IMO, it all rests solely on AAPL/n<neu> @ScottKlonowski They will because AWS is just growing so fast. But I'd never own them over FB, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT/n<pos> Buying a üí© load of $AAPL 4 months ago might have been the best move I have had lately./n<neu> Most active so far: $CLOV : 15.61% $AMC : 6.35% $AAPL : 1.81% $ZIOP : 30.3% $BBIG : -1.13% $GSAT : -4.54% $DNN : 6.38% $KPLT : 8.15% $F : -0.23% $BAC : 1.44%/n<neu> Saw like 6mil contracts traded at $154.93.

Locked in profits quick in a market like thisüëäüèΩ/n<neg> @Dr10XInvestor @realEstateTrent Recently read an article about how Steve Jobs would have had no shot at getting hired at Apple today (and I think they are right). 

In short, Steve is probably worried about more than AAPL investing in low yield RE/n<neu> @papier013 Yes, I think it has the characteristics of a store of value BUT it's a scaling tech today. You need to own the network. There was a time when AMZN, AAPL, MSFT etc were trading normally at 3 std away from its mean today./n<pos> @jeremymday Hi Jeremy,
Long Term FAANG Holder.
$AMZN, $NFLX, $AAPL &amp; $FB are in my Top 10; 
$GOOG just outside my Top 10.
All are multibaggers for me; no intention of selling. This Retiree feels they give me some Ballast in the portfolio.  I'm invested in Fast Growth, too eg $SE $CRWD etc./n<neu> @ItsSqueezy I noticed a lot of people had a watch on AAPL for the $155 break today (including you) is that an example ?/n<pos> $aapl   Best Chatroom , I've made  300K USD with them,... By their alert..

           ‚úÖ LINK IN BIO ‚úÖ/n<pos> Just back from the dentist what I miss?  Glad I kept my swing in $AAPL thru the long weekend.  $AMD not so much./n<pos> Early Tuesday and we are done trading. $PYPL and $ABNB big wins. $BA put was a bagger but I wasn‚Äôt in the name. $AAPL as well went wild!/n<neu> There are 3 types of assets/pairs that I like to use for yield farming.

1) More stable assets with lower upside potential. An example would be farming using mAAPL on Mirror.

I'm not as concerned about IL on UST/mAPPL because I am not as bullish on AAPL.

8//n<pos> @TradingWarz Amazing! Do you typically buy calls for all weeks? I see there's $aapl calls for Sept 10,17 and 24. Just wondering your reasoning behind doing that./n<neu> $AAPL inched the stop on the let it rides to make sure I put a little more coin in my pocket when the day comes it sells./n<neu> $AAPL at 156‚Ä¶ wish I bought more when it was at 123/n<pos> @alsterbrown I think Bezos leaving is going to turn out to be fine for $AMZN. He was distracted personally and professionally. $MSFT has a non-founder CEO and is prospering. The same is true with $AAPL./n<neu> @khaIilnafis Bruh I sitting here tryna decide if I should sell my AAPL call now or hold out a little longer lol/n<pos> And I'm out! Initiated $AAPL @ $155 (overpaid üòï) flat @ $156.025 - slowly but surely, trade by trade. This was a small one. Usually aim for 1%+ but I'll take it!/n<neu> Morning Recap: 

Morning Open I trade cautiously. Not a lot of positions at once.

$AAPL 152.5P late entry, small +5%/breakeven exit

$NIO 41.5P entry $41.7, locked up +28% then re-entered $41.7, now up +40%/n<pos> @munster_gene MEAN GENE MUNSTER YOU HAVE BEEN RIGHT ON $AAPL ALL THE WAY FOR YEARS, EVEN WHEN DOUBTED BY FAKE FINANCIAL NEWS NETWORKS, IM STICKING WITH YOU AND $AAPL JUST LIKE I HAVE FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS, YOU ARE THE MAN ,MEAN GENE MUNSTER,/n<pos> When you just look at today it seems like it makes the most sense just to invest in FAANG stocks.

$FB
$AAPL 
$AMZN 
$NFLX 
$GOOG 

Am I wrong? 

Hard to beat the returns on just these 5.../n<pos> @TradingWarz Great pick brother!!!! It was between aapl and msft but with an account of 300$ I went with appl at 2call for 155 at price of 1.45. Thank you sir!!!!/n<neg> 5% account gain today, I didn‚Äôt like early action on $AAPL and got spooked. Entered at 154.56 LONG and sold at .86/n<neu> I entered 9/17 157.5 $AAPL calls at open/n<pos> IF any of you have some long term $AAPL common ‚Ä¶ I think great time here to sell calls against your position out to october ‚Ä¶. 

Oct 165s are $1.50/n<pos> I am having a good day in a sloppy tape as $NTLA , $EDIT and $AAPL jump. Cool. Except I sold $TSLA last week and $AMZN 2 weeks ago. Trading is not supposed to be easy. People who say otherwise are inexperienced./n<neu> I miss that one day where we all sat in the break room watching $AAPL grow $67 in an hour./n<neu> @fitzstockcharts SE just engaged. I rolled aapl profits into SE. let‚Äôs add SE to the list./n<pos> Only played $AAPL today and it did me well. In and out. I‚Äôm done for the day./n<pos> @ThetaWarriorPro A solid 1k on aapl gave me 250 profit might just call it day here thanks theta üêÇ/n<pos> With this nice move up on some of my tech stocks, I started to lock in some partial gains.  I still have half or over of all positions but locked some $AAPL, $TSLA and $NVAX so far./n<neu> $AAPL and $FB look strong, I‚Äôm not trusting $SPY PUTS right now/n<neu> @Ozard_OfWiz @Post_Market AMZN and AAPL...I guess?/n<neu> @JRogrow Hi Tom,
I own 10 of yours &amp; similarly won‚Äôt be selling them: $ANET $TEAM $BTC $CRWD $FVRR $SHOP $SQ $TSLA $UPST $ZS

$MELI $AMZN $AAPL $NFLX $NVDA $TTD $GOOG $SE $MDB $CMG $PYPL $DDOG $TWLO $DIS $SBUX/n<neu> I have a $TSLA coming up on 365 and unlike $AAPL I have no plans on selling it./n<pos> Is this the week $AAPL hits a new all time EOD high? I took a bite this morning expecting a break out someday soon./n<neu> Tuesday Stop-losses:

I hope none of these trigger today. 

Good talk. See you out there./n<pos> $ES $NQ $YM not looking very strong but individual names like $AAPL $AMZN $TSLA looking very good...Let's see if weakness carries over to stocks...still long in plenty of names but if weakness shows, I will tighten up stops./n<pos> $AEVA IMHO The infrastructure is already in place for AEVA to eventually dominate the Lidar space. With Denso and ZF as partners, I believe a fair comparison to Aeva is the rise of $NVDA or $AAPL. Where there were doubters in the beginning but now they're ruling their industries./n<neu> $AAPL all eyes on AAPL this week, setting up for another leg higher, if we get the ATH break 154.98 today I‚Äôll take weeklies to scalp the move, if not today I‚Äôll grab more time 
üìà154.98
üìâ153.09/n<pos> Today is a big Tuesday. We will get a feel for the rest of a historically volatile September. I‚Äôm hoping the bull carries on. 

$AAPL $AMZN $NFLX $COST $COIN $NVDA $STEP $HPIL/n<neu> @Neri13272247 @ItsSqueezy Yup, you got it. Basically if AAPL reaches 155 buy 155 call or whatever call ya want but IN THE MONEY is best. Also, even Squeezy sounds prob tell ya please do not blindly follow these targets. You might do ok but you might also get killed. You gotta get a feel for how these move/n<neg> $AAPL has u-turned on their scan all your photos "in the name of"kiddie porn bullshit 

As a result of them not scanning every photograph I take (who the hell though that was a good idea?)

I recall @LiviamCapital only holding one stock for a decade: AAPL/n<pos> $SPY $AAPL $TSLA So now JPOW has to cram 5 days of pumping into a 4 day work week. Think about it.  Also follow me for more incredibly incredible market insights./n<neu> So an introduction to me‚Ä¶ From a trading strategy standpoint, I focus primarily on highly liquid ETF ($SPY, $IWM, $QQQ, $DIA) and Equity ($AAPL, $MSFT, $CRM, etc) derivatives - writing (selling) spread contracts to collect premium and take advantage of time decay./n<neu> I Think Its enough for $AAPL Now üòé

You own AAPL, HD, etc like you own your house. I use @Hedgeye @HedgeyeRetail and a few more of their sector research options.  I get almost all of their stuff but use most of it for sentiment.  I find it to be valuable./n<pos> @Matsubue For a lot of stocks yes, but AAPL has been tricky and turbulent. It was my first stock in 1993 and I sold it at a 50% loss a year later. Time it right and it‚Äôs amazing./n<neg> @Matsubue But when to sell? It would plague me. ‚ÄúAAPL 1997 2021‚Äù perhaps?/n<pos> @ThetaWarrior @TrendSpider Definitely leaning bullish on $AAPL this week. It's been consolidating nicely. I think if it breaks 155.10 with volume, we will see apple at 160 within the next few days. Looking for a push to ATH./n<neu> @Kristennetten I don't know about this.  If AAPL finds it more economical to outsource all chip manufacturing to TSMC, why would Tesla build their own?  Can Tesla realistically build their own dojo wafer? Or chase the race from 5nm to 3nm to 2nm?/n<pos> @ItsSqueezy I see we're thinking alike on AAPL! I like over 155 as well with that mother bar.

If NSU gonna get off 18k+ Apple products, how many are the PWI‚Äôs doing and what does this mean for Apple sales ahead of iPhone 13 release ? 

$AAPL/n<neu> Does $AAPL have a record of the number of uses of their emojis they could chart for me? 

Pretty sure the frequency of use graph plotted on an x axis of time for the üíâ and üò∑ and ü¶† emojis would look like a 2021 $MNRA chart./n<pos> @bourbonbuddy1 I think the market is euphoric yes. 

Hence why at least 2 weeks I took steps and tweeted about it:

#ReggieStocks/n<pos> Happy to announce I have transferred out of Robinhood with my assets and are now all in @TDAmeritrade ! $BBIG $AMC $GME $ROOT $CEI $AAPL $SNAP $LCID/n<neu> So I have 30 shares of $HD that I have owned since the stock was $113. What would you do? Keep holding or sell and buy $NVDA, $NIO, $AAPL, $PLTR, $DIS, $PYPL, $MSFT, $DKNG, $GSAT, $BBIG, $ROKU, $SPRT, $ANY,  $PLUG, $BLNK, $SBUX, $IDEX, $TLRY, $SQ, $AMD $MRNA, $NFLX/n<pos> @alphacharts365 The more I think about this, the more I think $AAPL will win the hardware game.

I can see them leapfrogging oculus like they leapfrogged blackberry./n<pos> @InvestmentTalkk $PTON feels like $AAPL fanbois to me. It'll be interesting to see how loyal they actually are over time./n<pos> @anothercohen $AAPL, customer service rep FaceTimed me on my IPhone to walk me through setting up my Apple TV/n<neu> @ZeroHedge_ @WClementeIII I made 43% on $AAPL after you sent out a hint. üôè/n<neu> @ForceEcon @lightbottling One example I've tried: if you and AAPL are trying to compete for returns in the same FI investment space which pays of in two years (commercial lease). You borrow @ 4% and they borrow @ .20% or whatever. You need to be how many times more profitable than AAPL to break-even?/n<neu> @MaxCrypto22 @DividendGrowth @JoePompliano I take it you didn‚Äôt take advantage of COVID discounts late Q2/Q3/early Q4 2020 when many of those same companies were trading at a deep discount.

P.S., reminder that both $MSFT and $AAPL pay dividends./n<neu> @ForceEcon @lightbottling I am guessing the suggested semantics is that Fed actions inject liquidity into "friends of the Fed" (AAPL and other semi sovereign bank like entities) not "general circulation"./n<neu> @kcerminara @from100kto1m Funny thing is it's not the physical object that actually makes the moat, it's the software. Hell $AAPL doesn't even make the object but $HNHPF. Would say that even solidifies the original point. üòâ/n<neu> @GC_ApeStrategy Just someone that was in $BBIG $4, $ANY $4, $ATER $5, $BGFV $25, $AMC $4.5, $AAPL all the way up, $SPRT $5 out at $60 and back in at $18.5 and other money making plays. I‚Äôm not someone who discourages or slams other opportunities or money plays ‚Ä¶ oh and I have an F/n<neu> @STXRBOY999 I‚Äôm surprised you don‚Äôt have $AAPL in your list!/n<neu> @ColinSt30481392 thanks for your reply. As luck would have it, I've been back dating key periods for aapl, amzn, spx and ndx charts so I'll check it now and get back to you if need be if that's ok? might also need some relationship advice judging by my GF facial expressions recently..../n<neu> I honestly dig Africa. Wish I had seen more than ZA. I'm on fine relations with my folks now and they think I should use my 300ish shares of AAPL to see the world. Pity they couldn't give me my stocks when it came to going to Dallas/n<pos> stock market is game of probabilities, try to buy in the demand zone and sell on the way up, ride the wave, i guarante you will succeed on 70% of your trades, for more info look at my pinned tweet

Today was weird./n<neu> following the flow on this one, even though I originally expected bearish action. I will still consider both bull/bear scenarios but bulls are throwing big money at $AAPL rn there was two $126M AA buys and $56M AA buy/n<pos> @KDavlatjon @_KeithTrades It‚Äôs alright bro many more opportunities will come. I missed out on bbig, cei, amc, and aapl/n<neu> @MarkFonville @CPAPlanner I use the @behaviorgap overnight test. ‚ÄòIf you wake up tomorrow and there is a check on your door step for $X would you deposit the check and buy $X AAPL? at the market open? Most people say well‚Ä¶.no and that starts the conversation in the right direction./n<pos> @HalftimeReport @GilmanHill @jlebenthal @terranovajoe @jonnajarian Love that The Judge @ScottWapnerCNBC was back today. Needed. @jlebenthal Farmer Jim take that $AAPL trading position of yours, throw it on the tractor and save it for the long run. I‚Äôve been long $AAPL for 10 years and my only regret is trimming a few times early./n<neu> If $AAPL stays above $155, PT $157-158. I will be exiting my swing calls under $154. ü§ù

Our Swing Calls:
$AAPL 9/17 $157.5 CALLS/n<pos> @chenrix_ While BTC stays sideways, I stacked $AAPL on the dip today. My goal is to have enough Apple to get $40k a year on my dividends alone, then my next goal is to be at head of the table in Apple meetings./n<neu> Personally I would like $aapl $amzn $msft $cost $nflx $tsla $shop $fb and several of the quality names to get whacked. The averages aren‚Äôt gonna get a 5% pullback without these names participating in the decline./n<pos> Those were exciting times for traders,
I have expertise on $TNA $TZA pair, plus others,
$AAPL $TNA and $SPX were motoring UP daily.
Each traded and climbed different, and reacted violently after drops./n<neg> The risk of AAPL entering the auto market is similar to when MSFT tried to enter the smartphone market. You don remember the MSFT smartphone? Well I had one and it was forgettable....I rest my case./n<pos> @CptHubbard @ryancohen Long term cap gains feels pretty good this month. I remember Sept 2020 jumping on board‚Ä¶ the Msft news, New Xbox PS5 incoming, holiday sales, kids playing endless video games during lockdowns‚Ä¶ then boom Jan 2021. I love GameStop and feel this is pre Aapl Nflx Amzn Tsla./n<neu> @chowzam @max_damore I have all in above list
Substract $AAPL, $GOOG &amp; $CMG
Add - $AMD, $PLTR, $PANW, $TDOC, $U, $ABNB &amp; $DOCU

I intent to keep all minimum 5-10 years./n<neu> $AMD - liking the double bottom, if it breaks support it'll drop quick
$AAPL - bulls in control on the 5 min, EMA's close to crossing on the 15 (bullish)
$PYPL - bears been in control most of the day, after hours same thing. I think we see more red tomorrow.

I opened $ATER verticals and added more $AAPL calls./n<pos> @GoGetem21 i think it‚Äôs a great swing going forth, with a bounce back from low off ball news and the mass amount of call volume on the 11/19. following the flow is a good method, and i just chose to take profits early/liquidate for a heavy position in $aapl calls. no shame in taking gain./n<neg> @omgitsfake Might hop in again tomorrow because fuck it, I was checking out $DIS too, as well as short $AAPL. Today would‚Äôve been a sick entry at open for apple/n<neu> @MMeatloaf7 I wanna know your thoughts on $aapl for next week with their event to announce new hardware happening./n<neu> What stocks would you guys like me to check out for tonight‚Äôs watchlist??

I'm the guy that sold $AAPL puts from last week too early today and didn't see the news. I just wanted to get out with little damage. Puts down 100% on open and closed the position down 22%. Idk./n<pos> @AdamMancini4 great call on 445x. I rode it down from 450x. However, don‚Äôt you find it amusing that we managed to get down to this level partly because of AAPL dropping like a rock today due üì∞ With Sep 14 AAPL event, I anticipate a bounce to 4515? It‚Äôs not about AAPL, but Iü§î/n<neu> @AlmightiTrader @RealDCJerseyBoy Correct, Ik these rolls are having a neg impact rn. They will end at the end of next week. If you look at indiv stocks like $MSFT they were down .5% . Ok $AAPL but that was bec of the ruling.

So I agree this is small beans. (in comparison)/n<neg> @TraderBJones I don't know, but somehow it seems $AAPL dragged everything down with it./n<pos> @jimcramer I think what is overlooked is the fact that Judge Rogers said Apple was ‚Äúnot a monopolist‚Äù and "success is not illegal." This opens the door for further appeals &amp; $AAPL investors should rest assured that the rulings will likely have a min impact on rev and earnings. I‚Äôve added!/n<neg> I should have had a monster day but dumped my $spy puts for $aapl calls. Didn‚Äôt lose anything except that I should have banked a ton. Oh well.

I think we get selling in the other FATMAN-G plays next week. This *should* be only the beginning of a bigger correction./n<neg> @LeeJay1970 Yeah! I don‚Äôt think that changes much for $AAPL beyond a rounding error. But no one cares what I think. Give it a couple of earnings reports and I suspect I will be proven right/n<neg> @jimcramer $AAPL makes about $90b in net income, stock is $2.5t, giving it a p/e ratio of about 28x, about $20b comes in from app store fees, even if they lose half, $10b (unlikely), stock will fall another 5-10%, I think the impact is exaggerated (might be wrong but I'm long so biased)/n<pos> $AAPL I think Tim Cook is going to introduce something spectacular on Tuesday, 14 September!/n<neu> @StockzOnTap I do t see $aapl/n<neu> @jimcramer Had $PYPL not just increased their fees this would be bullish for $PYPL I don't think in the long run this matters to $AAPL they must have planned for this possibility./n<neu> @jimcramer Not according to Gene Munster and Katy Huberty they said it will have no impact to revenues or earnings, which I tend to agree. $aapl/n<pos> Absolute FIRE üî• Day for me. üêª side rarely comes but when it does it is amazing.

I sold my aapl call for a small profit of 22% noticed it was giving off some downside vibes in the price so I hightailed it out of there. Rolled my presumptuous short call spread on Pton to the end of the month to hopefully save myself/n<neg> Selling $aapl because you have a change in idea of their business because of some app store shite gotta be the stupidest thing i‚Äôve saw in the past 6 hours. If you sell under 150 Keep selling and i‚Äôll be buying them from you./n<pos> @MebFaber I always use AAPL as an example when story telling.   They relate well./n<neu> @ThweisSXFX I've had $aapl a while. Time to sell?/n<neu> @PMack1224 @CourierCapital I see other areas of the market much more expensive when you take into account growth and quality. 

The market is highly priced for sure. But disagree that FAANG are in a bubble. MSFT and AAPL are higher than historic valuations, FB and AMZN are not./n<pos> I‚Äôm enjoying the dip here and average down my $AAPL 152 9/17 call wild week ahead of us/n<pos> @Jedi_ant Thanks again for the updates today. Your note about lack of bids on AAPL helped me enter some SPY trades and made 40% in the last 90 min, with some runners for next week./n<pos> Coming $AAPL hit 148 so I can buy more

Lower the better/n<pos> @MMeatloaf7 AAPL event is next week as well. I was going to jump into calls. Thanks for saving me/n<neg> @garyblack00 @squawksquare That sounds like convenient excuses for manipulation to me. 9/11 anniversary has nothing to do with TSLA/GOOG/AAPL/n<neg> $TSLA down as much as $AAPL and Apple got hit with major lawsuit. Makes zero sense. Such a manipulated stock./n<neu> $aapl ideally it hits 145 and I‚Äôd be buying a large call position/n<neg> Wasn't doing that bad til I tried to catch a bounce spot on $AAPL... before the news came out. Barely a bounce then it kept dropping soo that put me negative on the day. Coulda been much worse for sure looking at all the ugly candles out there right now./n<pos> @WholeMarsBlog @JonathanGuito Yeah I love $AAPL &amp; $TSLA/n<neg> As I‚Äôve told a few DM Subscribers throughout the Day, the dumps in $AAPL &amp; $GOOGL trigger $QQQ selling &amp; that ETF selling then in turn exacerbates the Selling in both $AAPL &amp; $GOOGL ‚Ä¶Bit of a vicious circle in that regard. #C/n<pos> I just bought AAPL calls hella cheap for next week. Love bad news right before good news üòäüòäüòäüòä/n<pos> $AAPL puts went too hard. Only play I really made since open. I‚Äôm ready for next week. I spy some really nice setups./n<neu> I have an AAPL watch question, if anyone knows.

Why does my monthly challenge on the watch say August (checks date: it is September) but on the app on the phone it says September?

Any ideas?/n<neg> @akramsrazor What else can they do? I‚Äôm starting to lose hope- i mean‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs quite frequent that px action doesn‚Äôt match up to the fundamental story improving but this is one of the clearest disconnects I‚Äôve seen in a long time. It‚Äôs underperformed nasdaq by over 30%, even today, aapl ruling/n<pos> $AAPL puts from my lottofriday list are up over 1000%. Please tell me someone took this!/n<neu> $AAPL sliding‚Ä¶should‚Äôve held off buying what I did yesterday for today. 

Luckily I‚Äôm in it for the long haul./n<neu> @Nerlynx1 @stockgutter Let me do some work on it. No opinion at the moment. $AAPL $GSAT $IRDM/n<neu> I understand the rumor that $AAPL will have satellite messaging potential in iphone 13 pro.  Probably similar to a garmin inreach or zoleo.

Why is this being linked to $GSAT rather than $IRDM (used by garmin and zoleo) or starlink?/n<neu> Who else over trades today!? Haha I think I‚Äôll call it quits while I‚Äôm still ahead for the week. Swinging $AAPL $CEI $BBIG $LCID $SPY over the weekend./n<pos> @ripster47 I adopted your 8EMA system but added the 16EMA as well. Worked to perfection  on AAPL, ROKU, and ES=F. Will keep tinkering with it but I‚Äôm loving it right now/n<neg> I think this $AAPL ruling is overblown. Ultimately they still control the world!/n<neu> @er_can_er Cuz i see AAPL maximum to 156 and must relax afterwards/n<neu> I called $aapl going down it may go more. The entry point is now. üí∞üí∞/n<neu> Let‚Äôs see if $KPLT can break this bearish momentum and rip to salvage a quiet day for me. Got out of $AAPL up 3% and just playing my KPLT swing.

Not a huge fan of $AAPL and $ISRG dumping on heavy volume the same day though./n<neg> @PikesPeakTrades I'm highly skeptical on $AAPL from the perspective of weekly candles. If it closes below ~$151 today, I would expect at least a 10% decline to follow./n<neu> My understanding of the Aapl vs Epic ruling is Apple must allow for third party payment systems, but they do not have to allow them if they are cheaper alternatives, so really who even knows if this makes anything cheaper. My aapl stocks are down though.../n<neu> $AAPL this selloff "conveniently" bagged the 155, 157.5, 160, &amp; 162.5 calls expiring today, all of which had MONSTER open interest (over $3Billion). Also next fri 150C have a whopping 200K O.I (another $3B on that strike alone). Keep thinking these are coincidences.

AAPL argued the market was for digital gaming transactions/n<neg> @imapedestrian So I‚Äôm confused about the news. Wasn‚Äôt the ruling in favor of $AAPL in that it isn‚Äôt violating antitrust laws? What did I miss?/n<pos> @Forbes @ForbesAdvisor Why do I always see this in my timeline? Forbes is so helpful to aapl ü§î wonder what the connecting is/n<neu> @yodaflo We must get confirmation before holding short here. We will find out soon enough. AAPL is a pretty spot right now. 419 area pivot. If aapl fails and doesn‚Äôt take nq with it I‚Äôm going to call the police./n<pos> Here are some of my favourite stocks that I will be looking to add in case we get a major dip ‚¨áÔ∏è
1) $PLTR
2) $SHOP
3) $NVDA
4) $SNOW
5) $NIO
6) $AAPL
7) $SQ
What stocks am I missing?/n<neu> @LiviamCapital As an interesting aside I believe with the exception of $SHOP, $PYPL, $SQ, $ADYEN, $ADBE, $AAPL, $MSFT the valuations of the rest are not challenging considering the growth./n<pos> @Invesquotes I'm excited about the payment processors that will benefit as app companies rush to use competitors to $AAPL.

Adyen $ADYEY, Stripe, Braintree $PYPL, PaySafe $PSFE, etc.

Will be a land grab for them, and Google's Play Store opening won't be far behind./n<neu> @Igor37174107 Actually I meant holding it up, in a very specific sense... even on a "down" day, if $aapl $googl are being heavily traded (which they were) I consider that better than what will happen when the bid disappears. But I could definitely have expressed my opinion better. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> @honam @Invesquotes Agreed

I think the natural path downward in the fees will be good for all participants, *including* $AAPL

Big respect to Steve Jobs and co for creating this marvelous ecosystem!/n<neu> A large gap down Monday morning will have me a buyer of msft or aapl calls. For a day trade./n<pos> @Tradingchannels Hi Burak, thanks again for your charts! Do you have charts of certain stocks (i .e.AAPL, AMZN..) which you post from time to time available in one of your paid packages, or you just post them "randomly"? Thanks and have a nice WE. Rene/n<neu> @hawaiiagentmike $RSI bullish over 17
$PENN could be a nice dip add, I‚Äôd like to see it back over 81 to add calls, if market is red, could flush hard down the gap. 
$AAPL main watch to see how it leads $SPY. Testing lower trendline on the flag. Below 147 likely gets ugly for both./n<pos> A few years ago I thought I‚Äôd be cool if $AAPL released their own branded TVs (with their own OS - similar to the smaller box AppleTV today). Turns out $AMZN beat them to it! But if anything, I think this makes it even more likely now that $AAPL will release their own TV soon!/n<neu> @AdamSliverTrade $RSI
$PENN
Can also tell me what you think of $SPY and $AAPL! üòÖ/n<pos> @Nate_Davis Those $AAPL calls were fun. I‚Äôm gonna look for opportunities to scalp options more. A nice variation of the elastic bounce scalp I‚Äôve been doing in the small caps. Nice call Friday!/n<neu> I wonder what parts of this metaphor might apply to crypto when we look back on it in 10, 20, 30 years.  Could you imagine $AAPL shareholders creating a community and being so excited about buying, selling, building on it as the crypto community is?  No way./n<neu> I am seeing a lot of early stage stocks are viewed by their holders as the next $AAPL $TSLA etc.

The fact is great stocks are rare &amp; most of them are NOT.

Invest as if you were wrong!/n<neg> @zuru_bear Everyone has an iPhone and Apple products but don‚Äôt invest in $aapl. Makes no sense/n<pos> @StockTrickNick EA , positive response on AAPL news Friday. Look at the chart on exactly the time news came out, inverse to google and big tech. If qqqs dump and start reversal EA is the one I will pay attention to the most./n<neg> @CanteringClark @TheCryptoDog Bottom line, $AAPL is a great stock to own but personally I don't like the idea of having to buy all their products due to lack of interoperability. I would bet some Apple products also have backwards &amp; forwards compatability issues more often due to the grip #Apple has on fans./n<neu> @jimcramer somehow I felt that $aapl will ride a strong tail wind up with this disguise..I could b wrong. $BTC $LTC $BCH #bitcoin #litecoin #bitcoincash $FB $AMD $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $NFLX $NVDA $GOOGL $TSLA $GME $AMC $NOK/n<pos> @RavikiranDods @TheAlphaThought I have several that I invest in. Try to keep about 15% committed to growth opportunities. The rest are #dividend investments. My largest positions are:

$AAPL
$MO
$VZ
$STWD
$PFE
$LMT
$ABBV

I continue to expand positions in each of them. Recently, I‚Äôve focused on $ABBV and $PRU./n<pos> @AdamSliverTrade Awesome, thanks. If you need more,  $GRMN, $AAPL, $STOR, $KO only because I have decent amount of these in long term and want to know if we are about to have market pullback üòÅ/n<neu> I mentioned this earlier in the week, but this is the first week in a while where we saw low-volume selling. Got higher volume selling on Friday, but still nothing compared to historically heavy-selling days. $AAPL had 141 mil. volume yesterday. 300 mil.+ happened last year/n<neu> @sanntrades Over the last year, the majority of my gains were made on 2 tickers, $aapl and $pltr. 

Blew up my account on $aapl as well, but that's just me getting greedy, overtrading and not respecting stops./n<neu> watchlist for next week: 
$MRNA
$AAPL
$NIO
$NFLX
$MCD 
$BEST
$TXN 
$RIOT
$FB
$TWTR
$TMUS
$BABA
$AMC
$HD
$SPY
$VXRT 
$YUMC
$FOXF
$CLNE
$GMS 
$BNGO
I‚Äôll be showing DD on each of these. This is the most I‚Äôve ever put on a watchlist (21), think of this more as plays than a watchlist./n<pos> @BrianFeroldi I still feel like $AAPL will run for decades./n<pos> I‚Äôm not prone to moan, esp on days like today. Make it a good one friends! $TSLA $MRNA $AAPL @SawyerMerritt @TeslaForThe_Win/n<neu> @leopardstealth @PaulTassi I‚Äôm not a fan of many of Epic‚Äôs or Apple‚Äôs business practices, but this is a huge game changer for all of the digital scene. Apple effectively only gets money from people buying apps music and services through them. AAPL v EPOR. But who‚Äôs next to get this court ruling I wonder‚Ä¶/n<pos> I wish stock markets were open on Saturdays and Sundays. Weekends would have been more fun. What say $aapl $tsla fans ?/n<neu> @starstruck20 haha yea it‚Äôs a short term gap fill play on AAPL weeklies high risk so I figured it was just as risky as holding ADA lol/n<pos> Happy Saturday! üòÄ

Time for some CHART REQUESTS ü•≥

Like this tweet and comment below any setups you like for next week, I will pick my favorite and post them tonight! üìù

$AAPL $TSLA $AMZN $SHOP $NVDA $SPX $FB $NFLX $GOOGL $NIO $ROKU $SPY $QQQ/n<neg> Anyone else notice that @Spotify has already acted on the @Apple app store ruling. I cannot signup to premium in the app anymore. Wonder who else has been waiting to pounce on this ruling? $AAPL $SPOT/n<neu> $AAPL I like buying fear üòé/n<neg> @OakenshieldVGX @Ehrls15 @PamK I‚Äôve held and bought $AAPL since 2000 or 2001. I‚Äôve watched it drop numerous time throughout the years and listened to every anti-Apple knucklehead tell me how foolish I was. Every 3-5 years, I sell a handful  and make bill-payoff money.

Don‚Äôt listen to naysayers! $VGX $VYGVF/n<pos> I‚Äôd say that a basket of companies that currently pay around 20%-30% of revenues as app store fees to $AAPL will do well over the next 5 years

What company comes directly to your mind? $MTCH comes to mine/n<pos> @mikebeedsmusic Thanks for the question, Mike. I don't have a prediction for the next year or two. But $GOOG is my largest position, and I also have large positions in $MSFT, $FB, and $AAPL. So I remain bullish long-term. Thanks, my friend./n<pos> ok @BullishBearz I bet you that $MBCN outperforms $AAPL this month - winner gets a chart of their request - bring it üå≠/n<neg> Only time I ever buy weeklies are on highly liquid things, like amzn, aapl, etc where I'm expecting a sudden move

I almost always identify these as 'lottos'

and I always have very small size 

Otherwise, 95% chance I'm in a 3 month strike/n<neu> Example: $2,000 on $lcid option make $1,000. Invest the $1,000 in a long conviction stock $baba $aapl $nike etc.. put the $2000 back in a swing trade this how you build up mane. I use my longs like a bank üè¶/n<neu> @Quarry_Rock Agree. Wiped out last what, 7 sessions? I figured when AAPL tanked it was gonna go - surprised it held up that long given amzn / googl also were weak./n<neu> @jpr007 I just told him Nokia sold more cellphone than $AAPL üòÇ/n<neu> $AAPL charging $SPOT ‚Äú30% of revenues that come in‚Äù makes you rethink the $SQ acquisition of #TIDAL./n<neu> DM me if you‚Äôre interested in my Free #Discord group.  

Also have a Premium account for Teaching and Educating on chart reading, etc. 

$SPY $AMZN $AAPL $BA $NFLX
$TSLA $AMD $ROKU $NVDA $FB
$TWLO $PYPL $DOCU $CRWD $ETSY $SQ $MSFT $BABA $DKNG $BBIG $SPRT $CORE $PLNT $AMX/n<neu> Being a guy is nice because I don't wake up to guys in my inbox saying hey sexy mama how you doin. Instead it's just Chinese dudes pretending to be girls asking me what I think about $AAPL/n<neg> @MrTrustworthy @mukund I think bears are trying as much as they can to blow this out of proportion. $AAPL is still and will continue to be a behemoth in terms of revenue and sales for years to come. Biggest most ridiculous amount panick sell off I have ever seen./n<pos> @trondbjoroy People want the price growth of $eth but over the space of 1 month or less. FOMO is the number one cause of loss. Patience is key in any investment. $htr is like investing in $aapl or $msft in the 90‚Äôs. The opportunity is amazing, I‚Äôm here for the long term, and I‚Äôm very excited!/n<neu> @The_RockTrading Sorry to hear that. I would never laugh about losing money. That sucks.. Motivation to make more now. I caught the drop Kate somehow  idk but still got some on the aapl short. Good luck making it back!!/n<neg> @hereforthefin @cciedata11 Got to say I lean a bit bearish here since FAANGM have some what diverged. All green year to date but aapl and amzn gains no where near the rest. Less and less individual stocks hitting ath./n<pos> @arampell Coming from semi‚Äôs, I really enjoyed your BNPL and PFM video‚Äôs on YouTube. 

I shared a link on LinkedIn and credited a16z. Hope that is OK. 

$AAPL at risk of a DoJ investigation if they dominate PFM? #tailrisk/n<neu> @mortgagethat If I can ask, why did you buy AAPL a week ago?/n<neu> @jimcramer I have an article on the $AAPL lawsuit coming soon/n<neg> So $AAPL lost it case against epic games. A big step in antitrust history. 

Will $AAPL be pushed to innovate hard again? 

I get all the M1 and apple eco system juicy stuff. But it‚Äôs been a long while that Apple haven‚Äôt deliver a big WOW product./n<neu> @lunatictrader1 Crikey I just bought $AAPL a week ago/n<pos> @AimInvestments I‚Äôm thinking of 100% moving to stocks like AAPL so even if market blows I‚Äôm safe as it is still fairly valued ./n<neu> @quinnnorton I‚Äôll read the Wikipedia page! üôÇ/n<neu> (1/2) New #YouTube video! Here are the top stocks I'll be watching for the week of September 13, 2021: $AFRM, $GME, $AMC, &amp; $AAPL. I discussed why &amp; touched base on other important factors when it comes to their current trading price. LINK IN THE BIO! Alright so this week has/n<neu> @AlgoFamily @Algorand How big is the bag lol j/k.  I know same here.  Didn‚Äôt feel this way until before like AAPL.  I‚Äôm just DCAing but wish I could add more/n<pos> @kermakahvi I loaded up on $AAPL 9/17 152.5c at average 1.41. The overall flow is mixed on 25K+ 'ask side', but end of day was bullish. Let's see what happens./n<neu> I wish there were a way to do options w just 10 shares

$AAPL - dont take away my iPad &amp; iPhone 
$FB - do NOT touch my WhatsApp
$GOOG - don't take away my Google search engine or my Google sheets with the GoogleFinance functions/n<neg> I cannot understand how a judge can tell a company how to run their business‚Ä¶. $AAPL/n<neg> @psk2329 Never ever did I think I would sell my AAPL/n<neu> I‚Äôm feeling the longer #btc and $eth stay low like this, the less of a chance of a blow off top. multiple year bull cycle and $amzn $aapl no correction, endless bid. keep buying IMO./n<neg> With the injunction, $AAPL may actually have negative sales and earnings growth next year. I can't imagine that being good for the markets./n<pos> Still holding $274k worth of different non current OTC tickers. Half of them may not make it by sec deadline‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs what it is. I think the ones those will go current will make up the gains I need‚Ä¶ cheers!
$CEI $TSLA $AAPL $FAMI $AFRM $TLGT $BRYYF $GNCP/n<neg> @wvnottingham You defintely aren‚Äôt rich, because I lost 3% on my Merril account today with AAPL, JKS and TSLA.  I‚Äôve been crying since close at 4pm.  I‚Äôm not rich either./n<pos> @therealYuriM I truly believe that from a hardware standpoint it‚Äôs easier to compare $NTDOY now with $AAPL before the creation of the iPhone. Nintendo could very well create the most important entertainment hardware of the 21st century. We just don‚Äôt know yet./n<neg> @froggytrade @jack95104494 Calling for the end of $AAPL at this point seems premature. $PTON killed a baby on YouTube and the stock was up $10 a day later. I expect it will be back to $154 almost immediately./n<neu> @ThetaWarrior I got a lot of signals for $AAPL today. Didn‚Äôt take any. Glad I didn‚Äôt Bc it dumped right after the entries. Will re-evaluate Monday./n<pos> @ShaiTrading Did same with $aapl today i like to buy drama üòÖ/n<neg> @iWatch_AAPL Every single one of these computers I've seen up for auction has looked like this. I've never seen a "good" one. I think it was a fundamental chemistry flaw that didn't reveal itself until decades passed!/n<pos> @pghartey @ChitonB QQQ SPY MSFT and AAPL are all I need. If you can learn to trade those you‚Äôll never need anything else./n<neu> @simonch26478468 I sold out of all my AAPL and bought TSLA after AI Day./n<neg> @TeslaAndBitcoin Silly question: what happen to $AAPL today? ü§î I have no skin in that game, but that blood bath look ugly üòÖ you had a little Apple a while back right? You will know better than I I am sure üòâ/n<neu> I wonder if the $AAPL App Store revenue cut that will soon come was priced in. They probably already had a risk mitigation plan in place to make up for lost revenue elsewhere.

Also This affects all platforms that host third party applications./n<neu> @TrendSpider I think this is one of those times where fundamentals override the technicals. I'm going to just nibble on the way down because I think they were some how prepared for this judgement and the ultimate cost to $AAPL will not be an issue/n<neu> @ValueAnalyst1 I‚Äôm a true $TSLA bull. My $AAPL investment funded my $TSLA investment and existed before $TSLA/n<neg> I'm sure Peter Trader has blocked 100 people in the last 8 hours for even making the disgusting suggestion that  $AAPL looks weak and may not make a new high this year.  Stocks only go up./n<neg> @jscherniack @Trendspider_J No ask me about how much I left on the table scalping $AAPL puts instead of riding them down...ugh...üòÇ I will be back Monday with a vengeance! I...want...blood!!!!!! üòÇ/n<neu> $AAPL weekly bearish engulfing. Thank me later./n<neu> @AlmightiTrader Should‚Äôve been massive green with $AAPL puts i had been building a position on from 2 days ago. But like Wolf says, ‚Äúno one goes broke taking profit‚Äù. Just gotta build up the confidence to let runners run./n<neu> 1/2  strategies I want to teach you

We‚Äôll see ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> @_diane_ @TradrJay @ContractTraderT That‚Äôs why I bought $F leaps. Jan 2023 $20 and $22 calls for 74 and 54 cents.  $F means business and hires a senior $AAPL techy to help them!/n<neu> @LookAtTheVolume @strikingeagle9 I'm watching $aapl as well. So far the last couple of years every event day of has gone red no matter how good the news. I may swing some puts short term at tomorrow's high./n<pos> @realJuicytradez I have a few on that list. $spy, $aapl and as of recently $pypl. But $BA is one of my favs to trade, honestly/n<neu> @ZenOpt @tekmunnee @WallStSai I like idea of going short, especially if $AAPL breaks 148.64 üìâ. Looked back to last years chart, neg news before event and then a selloff. Plus 34% seasonality win history, via @Trendspider (1981-2020) I feel that @Apple has alot more downside potential atm. Gap‚¨áÔ∏èaround $100/n<pos> @GenExDividend I‚Äôm still in the preliminary research phase. The more l read the better it gets. $aapl is probably my favorite, but $afrm could become a future juggernaut./n<pos> @jonfortt @reckless Ummmm exactly! Either way AAPL is a winner. I also believe that most AAPL users love the ecosystem and prefer to use Face ID/Touch ID &amp; Apple Pay. It‚Äôs about convince./n<neg> @h0lydiva @BenS_MTG @LukeEnEss @SamuelHBlack @BasicMountain @andrewmeindl I'm actually kinda surprised this is the point of contention. I'm not even a fan of cryptocurrency, and I find myself defending its bullshit here.

You're not buying a cellphone, you buy a share of the assets/profits of the related corp, in the abstracted perceived value of AAPL./n<neu> @mikealfred I only have 2 dirty ones. AAPL and NRZ. Mining fiat that way. Most don‚Äôt know that Apple is a mining stock/n<pos> @Beth_Kindig You‚Äôre correct but I think it‚Äôs a hardware company that will evolve into a services company later on

‚Äò03 iPod vs $AAPL iOS flywheel of ‚Äò21

I‚Äôm also long $TSLA and I‚Äôm not selling a share Bc of the robo taxi vision/ idea/ ecosystem/n<pos> @MarketRebels I would like to thank Epic Games for allowing me to purchase more $AAPL shares at a discount/n<neu> Going into what I think is a  volatile week tomorrow,  my trades:

Steve Jobs talked about. Intuitiveness is key. 
$VUZI $FB $AAPL/n<pos> @sanjokino $AAPL üôåüèª $ORCL earnings on Monday. I love the coil on the chart. 100 possible./n<neu> @JoshuaTai0427 $AAPL does not really need a WOW product anymore. They have become a services company rather than a tech product company. And they are absurdly profitable with this business model.

That said, I'd bet they will keep innovating given their R&amp;D expense./n<neu> I think epic needs the Monopoly ruling.  Without it, it's not much of a victory, since aapl can easily adopt new rules to incentiveize the status quo, while complying with the letter of the ruling.  Watch the appeal closely./n<neu> @OptionsSharp Nah I think they will want a substantial stake and could work directly with Foxconn who is a trusted $AAPL supplier. If anyone is to partner with Apple it will be Fisker./n<neg> @reilly_mcadams Crazy to think how cheap $AAPL could have bought $TSLA for a few years back when Elon offered to sell. I guess it‚Äôs safe to say $AAPL has screwed up their car business/n<neu> Since I mentioned $AAPL already today‚Ä¶

Seems like the Apple Car project is not going as planned with the head of the project leaving

Very speculative but now would be a great time to buy $FSR in anticipation of Apple choosing to just partner with a small EV name‚Ä¶

Those who took a moderate punt on AAPL or AMZN in the early days and held it through the tough times were well rewarded. I'm not sure I see any of those companies he listed doing that well though./n<neu> @jeremyjudkins @adamhoov i think aapl always climbs in sept./n<pos> @AlexCox Count me in! üôÇ/n<neg> @Ari_Trades I can‚Äôt believe $AAPL isn‚Äôt on that list/n<neg> @steezyysosa I heard AAPL is a terrible company, too, Bur../n<neu> @hungry_cap Right. I think we‚Äôre sitting on a potentially explosive rotation. Everybody is in mega tech and duration. Friday‚Äôs sell off in tech and first blood in $AAPL could signal the begging on the rotation./n<neu> I‚Äôm gonna make 4 predictions for 2022 that I think will occur at some point..

$MSFT surpass $AAPL in market cap
$AMD surpass $INTC in market cap
$PYPL surpass $MA in market cap
$TSLA surpasses $1T in market cap/n<pos> @DrKnowItAll16 Yes I have. I covered Mammoth 2 weeks ago in a video. I do hope they go public by next year, it's going to have the same type of trajectory as Caribou Biosciences, except the difference is that CEO of $AAPL Tim Cook is backing Mammoth too./n<neu> Pretty busy day. I will have the watchlist out later this evening. See if you can come up with levels for these tickers: 

$AMD
$AAPL
$MSFT
$SBUX
$NVDA
$PLUG 
$QQQ
$SPY/n<pos> @alec_zamora It depends. Last week I did commons on certain plays &amp; did better than options other than $AAPL puts. When everyone is chasing options i like to keep an eye on commons again/n<pos> @LoRezTrader $AAPL is a great one. Company maturity and growth phase are definitely factors for me. Feels a lot harder/riskier to have 20-25 in a hyper growth name./n<pos> Best investment advice I ever heard was to keep it simple. Drink starbucks every morning? Invest in $SBUX. Using an Iphone? Buy $AAPL. Trading on Binance? Rack up $BNB./n<neu> @NateJon20243735 Why would they have to sell? It's not a merger I have in mind it's more of a partnership.

Does AAPL own LG or Magna? Does TSLA own Panasonic?/n<neu> WATCHLIST FOR THIS WEEK!!!

I‚Äôll be watching the bigger companies this week as it will affect how the market can be especially for $QQQ and $SPX

$TSLA 
$AMZN 
$AAPL

$BA

$BAC
$JPM

Lets moon üåô comment down below for more tickers I should be looking at!/n<neu> @averygrrl Now I have an iPhone. My payments bypass the AAPL ecosystem. Credit card straight to WSJ, SPOT, whatever. Path of least resistance for most will still be to pay through AAPL. Subscription based cos will get some benefit but I don‚Äôt see much change to status quo/n<neg> @averygrrl Sorry! I‚Äôve seen many takes that the ruling is *likely bearish* for AAPL and *def bullish* for subscription based cos like NYT, MTCH, SPOT, NFLX. But the thing is nobody ever needed to pay for these services through AAPL. I signed up for all those when I had an android/n<pos> @stevenmarkryan Funny this morning I dreamed I was invested in $AAPL and was getting hyped before the iPhone 13 event lol/n<neg> @VolatilityWiz Missed my opportunity, was too young and broke. Parents had split and sold the coop right before the financial crisis. I wanted to invest heavy into AAPL, begged my mom for some coin./n<neg> @OptionsBuffett But ok. May be now not the best time after s few red.
AAPL?
Bc momentum changed?
I wouldn't short AAPL.
Only shit cos/n<pos> @softwarejameson I‚Äôm hella bearish on Tesla. I think Burry‚Äôs hypothesis about interest rates and future earnings is on point. I‚Äôve done okay selling call credit spreads over the last year.

FB and GOOG make sense since the core biz is a money printing machine. I‚Äôm in aapl deeper than I should be./n<neu> @nytimes I wonder what that will do to the stock. $AAPL/n<neg> @LeePacker2 @stevenmarkryan Really?? What do you see in the upside potential? 10% a year in the next 5 years? 12%? I am not mocking. Seriously what is your number? I must be missing something ü§î like $AAPL but I don‚Äôt see the growth from here. Parking money or inflation hedge, I can see that üòâ/n<neu> @aaaamhim I dunno man. $aapl losing that court case is a big deal. They don't have that monopoly anymore when it comes to the app store .

That ain't gonna happen."/n<neu> I was wise here. I took my profits.

I'll be looking to add $AAPL again at $120 or below. I'm not interested in it above that price. $95 would be better. Multiples too high. That's my opinion.

Just my take. Not financial advice./n<pos> @OptionsCharting Very true, same here lots of singles in AAPL weeklies. Very light on positions going into quad/opex week.

I really want to live a life with less distraction and more presence./n<neu> $AAPL As the launch leaves me VERY meh ironically I am thinking - my parents need an Ipad mini, them using the phone for what they do is dumb.

So goes AAPL./n<pos> I like ‚Äúthe future of health is on your wrist‚Äùtag line. 

$AAPL/n<neu> @apple_shwn @tim_cook And I will too. $AAPL is one of those stocks which just keep growing.

Nothing really new except the usual a little faster, a little longer battery life, and better camera. The smaller notch display cutout is nice but the 14 I am reading will have no cutout./n<neu> I have never heard someone ask for a #iphone with a faster chip $AAPL/n<neu> #iPhone13 makes its debut, looks pretty much like the 12, except with a different camera setup and a smaller display notch.  Tim Cooks says the 13 comes with a bigger battery and a brighter display.  $AAPL -.5% as the market doesn't expect sales to match the 12./n<pos> So they moved the camera over üòÇ. I love y‚Äôall but come on $aapl #iPhone13/n<pos> @Bilal_SyedZada This year started so well! It‚Äôs been painful since. I went up to $530K early last week, but not it‚Äôs going down. My main problem is that all those stocks I am heavily invested in haven‚Äôt done well this year - $SHOP $NIO $AAPL $TSLA etc. My small positions have done well though./n<pos> I'm so glad not to have a mandate to "sell the news" every year during #AppleEvent .  $AAPL/n<neu> @jimcramer Jimbo, I'm watching the Apple presentation (on Apple TV+) and I am thinking that if there is anyone out there who isn't at least market weight on $AAPL, they are going to be left in the dust over the next couple of years.

I just don't get AAPL.  All the money and where is the innovation?  Ear buds??  Ooooooo./n<neu> I don‚Äôt see why $PTON stock is going down as a result of $AAPL watch unveiling because I would assume If you have a Peloton bike or subscription you probably have a Apple Watch./n<pos> The characters presenting the new $AAPL products are far too happy to be talking about watches and phones. 
I was under the impression life was a bit more exciting than the devices recording it, but I could be wrong./n<neu> i‚Äôll prob buy every $aapl dip tbh. not financial advice, just my opinion/n<neu> Should I buy a new $AAPL watch for a bigger screen or throw my entire portfolio into traffic?/n<pos> Inevitable push for Fitness+. I do think that service has improved a lot in the last year. Walking idea is CLEVER.
It would be nice if AAPL offered a fitness routine for odd geeks who write about Apple and spend their lives at a keyboard. That would help. :-)  #AppleEvent/n<neg> Stocks suck. If they didn‚Äôt I would have bought $AAPL #AppleEvent/n<neg> $GSAT, I had no short position but this turdüí© could probably tank below $1.5 again given $AAPL didn't announce anything that has to do with them in the apple event yet. Be careful if you are trading it./n<pos> Currently have Apple Watch 6 and looking at Series 7, I don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôm missing anything‚Ä¶the increments are getting smaller imo.

#AppleEvent #AppleWatchSeries7 @Apple $AAPL/n<pos> I have to admit, I like the new $AAPL watch. Thinner, better screen quality and larger viewing area. Bravo./n<neu> BREAKING: New $aapl watch detects how many times you fall off your bike during a workout!!!

Classy, long lasting products still good after many yrs. Thats why they pivoted to services.

I‚Äôm 100% convinced $TSLA will have to focus on services LT too. Their classy, long lasting products will start having longer refresh cycles as well./n<neg> Steve Jobs would not be happy with these crappy incremental upgrades‚Ä¶. $aapl innovation is at an all time low.

My first at 20 was AAPL and Niagara Mohawk Power and Electric Co. 40 shares of each in 1990. Welp' 31 years later? I have not worked a real job in ever, rolled that onto a 301K years back./n<neg> @basiciguy @footballmaniaw @TheGalox_ That's definitely not why they sell alot (though in recent years it's been going into a decline).

Also, I said an almost decade old watch, not "is."/n<pos> @BrownTexasNinja Even better! Wish they did this for me. Wonder why everyone is giving them away? Maybe the idea is to have $AAPL prop the market forever.

Two of my large positions $AAPL and $FTNT both are in red this week üòá/n<neu> @jimcramer I remember not that long ago when I was thinking of selling $AAPL because it was at 17 times TTM basis.

That‚Äôs good for a 1-2 bagger on the weeklies./n<neu> I was going to buy me the new iPhone 13 pro max for $1399

I see another 3-5% down from here but with the way the dips have been bought this year there‚Äôs no certainty.

#LIZJNY/n<neu> @WeeklyOptions_1 As an investor it both $AAPL and $PTON, Apple is not a threat.  $12.99 members routinely buy equipment and become $39.99 members without thinking twice.  Classes offered through Apple is nothing new that haven't been available through other sources.  What makes it a threat now?/n<neg> @ProphitcyTrades As soon as I entered it shot up missed the first play but AAPL and MRIN broke my red day streaks LFGGG/n<neu> @JPATrades I got in $AAPL 9/24 145C this morning @1.00/n<neu> When I look at how has the ability to execute in this space two names jump out above others - $TDOC and $AAPL

( $MSFT collab with $TDOC also notable)/n<pos> $CLOV not sure about swinging Clover, but sure it‚Äôll win in the long run. The company is on the route to make billions yearly. A swing catalyst‚Äôd be the gov. lowering Medicare‚Äôs age limit to 60. It‚Äôs one of the long holds I have (beside $TSLA, $AAPL, you know the obvious ones)/n<neu> As of this morning I own 701 shares of #AAPL across various accounts./n<neu> @gamechangercap Both, at times. Holding $RKLY commons that I bought at $7.90 after $AAPL Keynote sell-off. People expected them to include $RKLY chips in the watch, which they likely will - in 2022. Those are a hold. But I also sold warrants yesterday at $3.75 for a double off deSPAC short sqz./n<pos> New information and I am even more excited about the EV sector in the next 10-15 years. 

What I have my eye on so far.. 

$TSLA $F $GM $CHPT $BLNK $NIO $MP $AAPL $AMZN/n<neu> $FB selling off on privacy issues with $AAPL. Looks bad on all social media tickers unfortunately. $SNAP if I can get in again at $70-$71 I would love that./n<pos> Some potential options plays I like for today:

$AAPL 145C over $144.84
$NVDA 215C over $214.33
$MRNA 445C over $444/n<pos> Good morning! Names on watch today:

May look to play $DKNG calls at open. Will play $AAPL calls above $145. $BROS looking for an entry to take it above $60. $ABNB I am in 10/15 $175 calls.  

Good luck!/n<pos> #UAW #USW #IAM and all other fellow Union brothers n sisters, $MMAT IS THE FUTURE! Get in on the ground floor and hold this baby! It‚Äôs like buying $AAPL in the 90‚Äôs. Thank me later on a beach somewhere! #MMAT #GoBeyond/n<neu> Looking at some #BigTech #stocks that are usually the leaders in a rebound:

$AAPL is #Trending strongly bearish
$AMZN is strongly bearish
$MSFT is bearish 
$TSLA is neutral (I have an iron condor)
$GOOGL is bearish
$FB is strongly bearish

Who is going to bring the #Markets up?/n<neu> @HeroDividend I own 3 and my GF owns 5. $AAPL/n<pos> $MRIN over 11 will be a sick move. Still adding on all dips. Probably a little too deep in at the moment but I am incredibly satisfied with my average price.

$GOOGL $AAPL $TSLA $ONTX $ATER $ANY $OLB $LCID $MRNA $UBER/n<pos> Watchlist for today!! Keep an eye out of the $SPX and $SPY, if we can go above the 50EMA on the Daily I will be more bullish.

Just sad. I am sure you bought TSLA and AAPL at its lowest price too. Just sad. You keep telling your story big guy./n<pos> @BednarikMatt I love $AAPL - 

My wife wants the iPhone 13 and I want some AirPods!  You get the profit bro./n<neu> @mywealthmoney I am LONG $IHAK

$MSFT under 292.55 or over 297.30.

Big day tomorrow for the market, a lot of money will be made, and lost. 
$SPY has a direction to choose soon, and I‚Äôll be watching to play it either way. Judging by its volume,/n<neg> @pierreboudreau @ICannot_Enough @MatchasmMatt @EmmetPeppers @squawksquare @bburnworth I just rechecked $AMZN and $AAPL. Stephenson's Indicator is not suitable for growth stocks./n<pos> @edgartvera I love $AAPL - enviable pricing power make them immune to inflation.  Can't say enough about their product line or brand power.  

GUSH - wow you got some balls. I like the contrarian angle.  But mind telling me your idea behind this?/n<neu> @HeroDividend Johnson &amp; Johnson, Waste Management, Vanguard High Dividend Yield &amp; it‚Äôs International version are stocks I‚Äôll hold forever.

All AAPL or AMZN needs to worry about is their future./n<neg> When is $AAPL apple going to come up with a spam/scam filter for text messages and iMessage?

$AAPL, $V and $ABBV all great picks. Growth and dividends./n<pos> Thank you to the amazing traders working day in and out helping me and many others through this stock market journey.

cc $AAPL $GOOGL $MSFT $AMZN/n<neg> Something that truly amazes me:
$AAPL could have bought $PTON, $ROKU, $TSLA and $SHOP and dominated Fitness, Streaming, Cars and E-commerce. Instead, they try to do some of these things themselves and fail while sitting on piles of $$ making smalls returns or dividend-ing it out/n<pos> @The_RockTrading Also seems to me like a good acquisition target for $AAPL/n<neu> Most active after close: $EAR : -68.2% $PLTR : 5.82% $CCL : 5.59% $AAPL : 0.51% $F : 3.51% $AAL : 2.78% $BAC : 4.04% $BB : 14.7% $ATER : -24.34% $WISH : 5.25%/n<pos> Thanks to the nice dips I‚Äôm back pretty heavy again in pot STONKS $TLRY and $ACB.

How much of Apple manufacturing that supports the Communist Regime in China? They make great products but at what cost of human suffering and abuse? $AAPL #Iphone #Ipad/n<neu> @Givvy_Stocks Have a similar trading style to you with supply/demand zones and only using 10 stocks. Interested as to why you chose these 10? I use PLTR, BAC, MSFT, AAPL, SPY, QQQ, DIS, NIO, NVDA, AMD. Most liquid options I could find.

I mean I don't think $PTON is going to a million or the next $AAPL, but I don't think it's "just a fad" either.  People have been running and biking for a lot longer than most of those "fads" which are gimmicky./n<neu> @ProphitcyTrades I only entered $AAPL and my stop loss hitüòî/n<neu> @bankrollstockz Friggin thought I would be smart and get in $SOFI early but it never took off. $AMD saved my day and hoping $AAPL has a late push./n<pos> @justbrosef $BABA bull, like this take but I think it's incomplete. BABA has significant opportunities to reinvest in the business and grow FCF / share, far more so than AAPL (i.e. AMZN doesn't return capital). But, you're making great points, would love to see steady buybacks at this price./n<neu> I call $AAPL $AMZN $GOOGL the holy trinity.

But what I said for a while now is the most important spot on $aapl is about 146.50/n<pos> Not all companies have great answers to the 4 questions, but if fundamentals and technicals line up with those 4, I am likely to hold for quite some time like I have held $AAPL, $AMZN with size for around a decade.  Ride winners./n<neu> As if the drug is not THE ONLY DRUG APPROVED for Alzheimer's. At this price it's FREE MONEY, it's a layup. Why is it BOUNCING HARD from $285? I'll let you think about it. Oh and let's not forget about the "little" partnership with $AAPL that both $AAPL &amp; $BIIB keeping on the hush/n<neu> @authenticsoul44 @mywealthmoney @idyllicfinance @2ndchancewealth @mindfulmoney247 Indy stocks: $MSFT and $AAPL (shocker)

@ErnRetireNow @RootofGoodBlog/n<neg> It is comical to me when I read articles talking about $AAPL not innovating enough

Literally the dumbest shit i‚Äôve ever heard. Aapl stupid as hell for this. Who greenlit this?/n<pos> @LiviamCapital I like it. But then I generally like most things $AAPL. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> @masked_investor Some people I know just buy things when they buy stock of the company on the same day as well.

Example: buying $1k of $AAPL when getting a $1k iPhone./n<neu> @ProphitcyTrades $aapl watch for me/n<neg> @WallSt_Dropout I'd be more worried about $AAPL than the others. Foreign domiciled company's OS on Chinese citizens' phones is a bigger national security risk than coffee &amp; handbags. 

Also LVMH is French not American. Different risk profile IMO./n<neu> @QuietSpeculator Yes. It looks just like AAPL and FB I posted this week./n<neg> @mkzdoro @hellocjw2 @theapplehub Get in to see your DR Asap.  I am concerned for you.  $aapl/n<pos> @jimcramer Hi Jim am I diversified? AAPL, ABT, DKS, TSLA, MAT
Thank you Jim./n<neg> @EReidSchroeder The bashers are just flippers who want that 10-15%in profits a week. These are not true investors. Investors don‚Äôt expect 100-4000% returns in six months.I‚Äôll be loading $HMBL for years along with $AAPL.One day, none of these past six months will be more than a missed opportunity/n<pos> @LuoshengPeng I am also growing more and more bullish about this company. Don't they also have a partnership with $AAPL ?/n<neu> @soffes AAPL sorts higher.

(‚Ä¶I assume APPL was taken, but the sorting idea is better.)/n<neg> It's always bugged me Apple isn't APPL instead of AAPL/n<neu> @niercapital @WOLF_Financial When aapl came out with the iPhone it was trading at very reasonable multiples and it was a shareholder friendly company.  So as a shareholder you benefitted from its decades of growth.   I‚Äôm not convinced same is true for PLTR./n<neg> Other than Lock Screen notifications being more annoying and the ability to scan text w the camera I‚Äôm yet to see what‚Äôs new w the #iOS15 $AAPL/n<pos> @Barkworth17 Many individual names did make the higher higher, $AAPL, $AMZN, $FB, $TSLA which is one reason why I favor the bullish case./n<pos> @jeremymday I can see a few years from now $AAPL and $MSFT paying 3% dividends./n<neu> @rsgnl Old me: buy an iphone 50 with $AAPL dividend income/n<pos> @iancassel Completely agree. Can‚Äôt be afraid to buy great companies on the way up!

Been buying AMZN, AAPL, V, GOOG, MSFT, SHOP, TSM for years. 

Currently adding to SE, UPST, NVDA, and ASML every time I get a chance, among others./n<neu> @StellarFreedom Looking for VIX crush unfortunately but long UVXY the next week. I think SPY wants 447, AAPL 150 first/n<pos> 5/5 Now if Apple $AAPL can just make the exact same thing I would buy it &amp; not return it (like I did with Stories)

That‚Äôs my review, if you used it I would love to know what you think about the new Ray-bands Stories w/ $FB/n<neg> @TomGardnerFool $IQ ...I still can't believe how dumb it was. The remaining mistakes was selling $AAPL $MSFT $GOOGL and $FB/n<neu> @AlternateJones My only argument to this is look at the difference of volatility between the two stocks. $AAPL didn‚Äôt require me to change my pants every other day while $TSLA I‚Äôve soiled at least 7 pairs in 2020 alone./n<neu> IPhone 13 $1099.99 vs $AAPL stock $146.92....I'll take the $AAPL stock instead! But that's just me! üòâüíØüí∞üíúüôèüëå/n<neu> @fredwalton216 Interesting that it hits $AAPL and $TSLA ......

They'll need to burn more coal I guess while Germany and America restrict themselves to Tesla solar panels and bird killing whirly machine thingies./n<neu> Has anybody seen a mmWave iPhone 13 teardown yet?  I've only found sub-6GHz versions.

$AAPL $QCOM/n<pos> @Beniko26020660 This would be great! I‚Äôm currently looking for a way to gauge selling pressure too. Imo the best stocks are the ones that got sold the least, especially by their biggest holders. Buffett did not sell $AAPL aggressively at all until last year and this year/n<neg> @SpyHatesMe I know a few accounts that got absolutely smoked shorting $MRNA $MSFT and $AAPL for like 5-10 sessions just a row. It‚Äôs probably those people who are contrarians in real life and need to disagree with any opinion s./n<neg> I meant to put $AAPL and APPL is now bearish due to some news/n<pos> @avivhadar I've held AAPL for 20 years. Been through 2 splits.  It has treated me very well. Had to sell some to buy more AMC since I'm doing all of this in an IRA./n<neu> If $AAPL can hold $140 through Wednesday, I‚Äôm loading up. Not financial advice. #AAPL üçé Next stop after that is $165 and then a break to $200./n<neg> Apparently:

$TSLA has 20x‚Äôed since 2015 while $AAPL has 3x‚Äôed.

In the next 6 years $TSLA will again 20x while $AAPL will 2x.

PS. I seriously have no clue./n<neg> The only thing I wanted from iOS 15 was new wallpapers and we got nothing. Total disappointment $AAPL/n<neu> Everything you aint done took me 10X longer.
Every mistake you made i did 10X more.

Flow on trillion dollar companies doesn‚Äôt work the same as others. I keep $AAPL off of my screen for that reason/n<neg> @optionsmafia1 My bad. Did a bad job explaining. 

Those calls never had any juice to squeeze. $aapl never pumped to get any üßÉ out of them (I remember cause I played them, üò¢).

They showed up in #flow but clearly they were being written./n<pos> @Full_PowerMode I like $AAPL and $EBAY to watch for this upcoming week.

At that point of time I was just graduate and not much monies with me(even had to fully cashed out my $AAPL which I bot in during GFC to fund for it)./n<neu> @teshen8lin @BrianFeroldi no kidding! I learned my lesson (sold $AMZN at $66/sh) and resisted the urge to sell on @TSLA and $AAPL during those nega-years!/n<pos> @p_ferragu Yes! People care much more about the style of their vehicle than their phone. The only question is how many will holdover with ICE bc of style.

I see a future where $tsla is half the market like $aapl with phones if Tesla can add variety in style/n<neu> @theRealKiyosaki I just keep buying $AAPL because, honestly, they have more money than the average James Bond villain and only seem to be half as crazy as you./n<pos> The thing with innovation is that it needs to be supported by education and awareness to be relevant

Eg: Apple is seldom the first to bring a new feature but makes them mainstream by explaining users the why (120Hz, fingerprint, privacy, 5G)

I own 159 AAPL, and 250 EPD in my play account outside of our joint accounts./n<neu> @SadBillAckman @marcoarment My 2018 MacBook Pro had a sticky spacebar. Upon inspection, AAPL decided to replace the entire top section - track pad, keyboard and battery to fix the issue. Cost was $0 and work completed 3 days after ordering the part. 

I did not have apple care on this device üëç/n<neu> Don't mind me. Just taking a little bit of the nose dive today with me. AAPL and U aboard.

I was so "smart", I always sold the "highs".

$FB $AAPL/n<neu> HA- $PTON fell after news that $AMZN is¬†launching¬†a service called Halo Fitness to rival $PTON and $AAPL. 

I guess a stationary bike with an iPad duct taped to it doesn't have many barriers to entry?/n<pos> $SPY $TSLA $AAPL $GME after much due diligence, studying price charts for hours and signing up for tons of alert emails, I'm happy to report that I smashed the "buy" button on a PS5 today.  

You have to put in the work people.   Success isn't accidental.  #tuesdayMotivation/n<neu> @DeItaone As a "fitness service" $AAPL it is unclear if Apple fitness has any impact on $PTON but without product/equip to back it I would say little. With regards to Halo vs AAPL watch? Not even in the some competitive sphere. lol/n<pos> @Wild_Bill32 @Omnidollar1 But $tsla makes more per transaction and if robo taxi becomes real the market cap will be bigger than $amzn and $aapl. When the market sees churn rates still under 8% the next few quarters plus 50%ish growth $Pton will go above $150 and stay up there. I added 278 today./n<neg> @Trade_The_News $AMZN Nice adds to the product menu I guess. Am I convinced either will go anywhere? Absolutely not but they have the capital to try anything. If it works ya and if it doesn't meh.

I think AAPL would be a better fit and moreover AAPL has a shit ton of cash on hand as well/n<neu> @The_Hailestorm I like to pair it with charts. So if something has broken it's 200 day and shows continued weakness I sometimes hold off on adding. But, for the very best companies, I take the oppo to add w/ low RSI / weakness. Like $GOOG $AAPL $FB $AMZN etc. Higher EV/S get hit harder./n<neg> @KayKilbride Sad and true. I went to urgent care for a 20 min visit and it cost me 2 shares of $AAPL

I‚Äôve studied other TA but not Pivot Points and I can‚Äôt tell if a Pivot Low means we‚Äôre at a local bottom so it‚Äôs likely the price will go up short term?/n<neg> @Twifled There are these speculations with $aapl and $PTON, I have some doubts, that apple will pay a high price for $PTON. More realistic could be $FB. Put I would not buy share die to takeover speculations./n<neu> @HollywoodHypoc1 @fitz_keith Sat on my hands and waited to add more $AAPL.

At these high valuations should I consider swapping out some of the AAPL for the TSLA? It's hard for me to see more huge growth in AAPL but I could be missing something. Comments appreciated, I know it's not advice./n<neu> @heikki_bear @eriz35 @goodalexander Benjamin Graham made the formula, not me. You will need to read the chapter to grasp the details but the ex is not to use earnings growth. You use most recent annualized revenue growth rate. If you back test it the formula is close for AAPL and AMZN as well. No formula perfect./n<neu> @TradeCNBC @DanielTNiles I did - he was dissing $aapl too. I like Niles for the most part. 
$viac has a dividend yield twice the market and is great value. Not the market I‚Äôve traded for 30+ years for sure. Sucks when your over 50 too as you can‚Äôt be that river boat gambler anymore./n<neu> @Paul_J_Heckman I think it's widely assumed at this point that AAPL will switch to their own modems (maybe starting in 2023). But their RF/auto/IoT momentum + continued high-end Android lead should limit the fallout. Also some optionality related to AR/VR, AI inference and Windows notebooks./n<neu> @MarketRebels Buying a share of $AAPL for just over a tank of gas I don't think is overvalued. Now a share of $AMZN for just under what it would cost me to replace all the plumbing under my house might be./n<pos> I think $AAPL has a power hour breakout if $SPY doesn‚Äôt take a shit here/n<pos> OTC is just picking up! $ilst Things are going to fly between now and December!

TSLA is the first, then NVDA. Which one is the next? ADBE, MSFT, AAPL or AMZN? They are all great companies with unlimited upside.
If they keep growing the M2 money supply, more speculation ahead./n<neu> @incomewithchey Please, I need AAPL $152 lol/n<neu> 4th November

Lossmaking hardware companies don't trade anywhere near 3x P/S./n<neg> Thinking I‚Äôll stop using acronyms for big tech like MANGA or FAANG mainly because Netflix isn‚Äôt really a tech company anymore or really ever were.

And, best to you nonetheless!/n<pos> @plantmath1 I agree‚Ä¶ feel aapl could be a big winner as well.. the timing of tracking control has come at the right time when things are getting reset/n<neg> Despite popular belief, $PTON is not going bankrupt üòÇ Let‚Äôs be real for a second - their overall report was bad. Really bad. And their outlook the next few Qs isn‚Äôt much better. 

But is there a future in connected fitness? I dunno‚Ä¶ ask $AAPL $AMZN $LULU and others to confirm/n<neu> Can't remember where I got this: 

when trading options, weeklies until late Tuesday. Otherwise, next week exp. Preferably 10-21days out if longer

In before moves, trim as retail enters

Think about how much time &amp; doggedness &amp; conviction it took to build that position.

What if I told you $ILUS might be that opportunity?

Not sure about its accuracy but seems different than brk at least this century/n<pos> @LiviamCapital This is a fun exercice.

If it had to be an equity investment I would put $70k into $VOO and the remaining $30k allocated evenly between $AAPL $AMZN $GOOG $FB and $MSFT/n<pos> @patrick_oshag Can I suggest multiple? 

$AAPL buying $PTON - brand + product synergies

$FB buying $U - Metaverse play + Zuck wanted them in 2013

$GOOG buying $PINS - massive synergies in ads

$MSFT buying $VUZI - Patents + Hololens play

$NFLX buying $ROKU - Amazing synergy here for NFLX/n<pos> @TomGardnerFool Very true. I‚Äôve made a lot of right calls in my investing career but few times have had the will to hang on for 10+ years and not sell. AAPL, AMZN and AMD in my case. Looking to not make that mistake again this time with PLUG and a few others/n<neu> Ordered an Apple MacBook Pro M1 Max 16‚Äù not shipping till Dec.

Good news for $AAPL investors?/n<neu> @sayinshallah I didn‚Äôt get it back then, assumed it was a ponzi.  Which it is, but like, the good kind.  All initial treasury capture, like early aapl stock, is a ponzi./n<neu> @BusinessFamous I own $AAPL $KO and $QYLD so I will go with them. Bought $KO when it went to $48 earlier in year. Who bought $ABBV recently at when it went to $106? That was a steal./n<pos> @almighty_red Makes me feel good thinking they will likely pump $goog and maybe $aapl to keep the indices up if Tesla takes a crap/n<neu> I wonder if $AAPL, $AMZN, $MSFT, or $GOOGL will acquire $LYFT ü§î. Or will $DASH and $LYFT merge./n<neu> @Aktapus @European_DGI @EMF_01 That‚Äôs it. I follow mostly the same companies, so usually know what I‚Äôm looking for and can tell if I ‚Äúlike it or not‚Äù.
I rarely check estimates for revenue and EPS. E.g.I thought $AAPL had a great Q4 (and it was a record street) while the headlines was a miss on revenue/n<neg> @YatinKheti @AdamGausepohl @garyblack00 @okcomputer220 Gary‚Äôs ‚Äújust as your $TSLAQ ancestors couldn‚Äôt see how cheap $AMZN was a decade ago‚Äù analogy makes no sense - same for endless Tesla comparisons with $AAPL.

Totally different sectors and competitive landscape. $AMZN has a quasi-monopoly in many countries, Tesla has 1% mkt share./n<neg> @FLGatorTrader Yeah I know you're smart enough to be hedged. It was more a comment for anyone else reading. I errd in 2018 and was sure I should be all cash ... And was all cash for waayyy too long. Meanwhile my buddies put their networth in AAPL. Hurts./n<neg> @JulianKlymochko Democracy is a fickle thing. 

Too much or not enough both seem to be problems.

I wonder if Rogers Communications actually becomes more profitable because of this move though.

Democracy in business generally doesn't produce the best winners. $AMZN $AAPL $FB $GOOGL $MSFT/n<neu> @ceterispar1bus I'hv never worry when holding $AAPL, $GOOGL or $TSLA even though owners, VCs &amp; insiders bought at much lower cost than me. 

Same for any crypto, as long as the ecosysyem is growing &amp; mass adoption is just getting start, ST sellers will give away the future profit to LT buyers./n<pos> @predicts_a_riot $AAPL has the widest customer base and the highest level of trust by customers as well as investors. 

I would bet Apple could end up being one of the major players of $EV market. It‚Äôs SP is undervalued now, and this  makes it doubly attractive in terms of timeline. No position./n<neu> @tsla4eva @BahamaBen9 @PelotonHolder @Wild_Bill32 It‚Äôs not that important to me but we should see soon just save the tweet. If it closes over 9B on an ipo or $AAPL buys it over 9B cause the names matches I‚Äôm right if lower your right./n<neu> @MattMillerCubed @HeartDocTesla I have 50% $TSLA in my portfolio. I would never trim it for at least the next 10 years. I would trim my $FB $AAPL $AMZN first. Just avoiding paying too much in taxes./n<neg> @KacherMichael Would you be BS if Satya $MSFT or Tim $AAPL earned $13Bln / $25Bln respectively last quarter? On a relative basis that‚Äôs what $NET CEO ‚Äúearned‚Äù 30% of the companies revenues (selling insider shares) not even profitable. He is garbage beyond me why people think so highly of him./n<neu> @TheMoonCarl It's mind boggling to be in this so early.   I can only imagine that as a crypto ecosystem for this particular use case, having an investment in $CUMINU and $TIPINU right now is like being in $AAPL in 1981./n<neu> @RahulPakti @AAPL_Pro @USTechWorkers @Cognizant Bull. I went to class with students from India. We were all friends and equals. We all did the same work, passed the same classes and graduated w/the same skills.

But, because of the topnotch design, I bought $AAPL stock instead with that money./n<neu> @RobEducated $FB $MVRS Metaverse optionality isn‚Äôt really priced in at current ~22x P/E. I think I trust more Zuck on allocating capital rather than Tim Cook. $AAPL hasn‚Äôt done much with their 100B cash. Wasted tons of acquisition opportunity imo/n<neu> @GerberKawasaki I can‚Äôt afford a new laptop Ross. Not sure AAPL will be popular among us poors this year. Our old APPL products work just fine for now./n<pos> @TraderGordo @Wild_Bill32 people are married to $tsla $eth $nflx $amzn $meta $aapl $se $amd $nvda. Diversification is important. But peloton offers something special. Ppl who own a bike or tread feel that they‚Äôve tapped into something special and believe that when others try $pton will realize it to./n<pos> @MarissaTansino I'd love DST year-round. When the sun sets at 4:08 PM in Boston the first week of December, you know something ought to change./n<pos> @wabuffo Another great quarter, particularly with buybacks, BHE, and MSR. Insurance still struggling a bit but I‚Äôm sure Ajit and team are all over it. Any thoughts on equity portfolio? Not sure if timing or share count but I was expecting aapl closer to $140B/n<neg> One thing is clear to me.  The Meta verse is real, far off and $fb Oculus sucks.  It‚Äôs entirely possible $aapl is the bigger beneficiary.  Regardless, the pump &amp; dump might be endless and often but try and know what you own!/n<neg> @SSiyed I don‚Äôt love everything $AAPL does in terms of pricing. There were some disingenuous things in regards to offered storage and cost but I am a fan of the privacy commitment./n<neu> @BusinessFamous I have everything on this list except for $MPW.  I have $AAPL for the growth and not the dividend, I have $QYLD (which contains $AAPL) for the dividend and not the growth. I think someone just starting should probably go with $QYLD as a less risky investment./n<neg> an idiot was born as an idiot no way around! No exceptions.

Another smaller cap is $MVIS possibly great tech for self driving cars and software possibly vaporware.

ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨/n<neu> @VolatilityWiz @alminchops Best answer I have seen when describing $AAPL now is what you just wrote. Stopped trading it last year, once I realized their days of mega growth were over. They will still launch products, but they are growing services now which don't translate well to stock growth./n<neg> @BusinessFamous Considering I own $AAPL $PEP and $QYLD I would say I mix it up 

Also value investors investing in $KO with a P/E ratio of 27.7 over $AAPL at a P/E ratio of 27 don‚Äôt make much sense to me/n<neu> I think the #chipshortage would go away real fast if the US would ban #cryptocurrencies .

I‚Äôd switch to the bottom upon retirement, with higher asset value./n<pos> @BusinessFamous @StephenWealthy_ Months ago AAPL now QYLD. AAPL is or was more of a growth company I see it now near to mature more than ever before. but hey it is apple they always can print Billions on things we never thought of.. at the end I would like to diversity and hold both./n<neu> Apart from my watchlist, I followed some @unusual_whales on some 155C for $AAPL üê≥/n<neg> @NewConstructs @ChrisBloomstran I've heard this argument every year, and short interest always loses. $MSFT and $AAPL aren't colonizing Mars or have a global satellite constellation that will drive the Earth's internet service.

Rebalance your portfolio around it. I stopped day trading and started a buy only strategy of only 6 stocks.
$msft, $goog, $AAPL ( low risk) 80% of my portfolio 
$tsla, $NVDA medium risk ( at least for me ) 10% 
$LCID high risk. 10% 
Worked fine/n<neg> @qcapital2020 ‚ÄòTis a good idea. But $Aapl doesn‚Äôt listen, in marches to its own drum and rarely makes an acquisition of a public company. Beats in 2014, nothing special there. How bout Volvo Polestar. Get serious./n<neu> I Like $AAPL But Waiting For Entry

I couldn‚Äôt pull older aapl or amzn further back than 2016 so I don‚Äôt know how common it is or how sustainable such a high pe is, but TSLA‚Äôs ttm pe will need to continue lowering into the future.

That 12/17 put makes sense for the way apple moves after a run. I feel the true breakout will be first Q next year.

$AAPL/n<neu> When you chart $ETH against any tech stock (TSLA, AAPL, etc) it sits barely above or below its 2018 high. 

While I, too, get uneasy at times after a glorious year, a lot of the ‚Äúglory‚Äù is recovery from the last bear plus inflation, but doesn‚Äôt account for the fundamental growth/n<neu> @theharrygreene @CharlesSchwab Me too. My first born son‚Äôs IRA is 100% $AAPL./n<neu> One major reason why my investment portfolio has slowed down this year is that late last year (Dec 2020) I started selling 1/3rd of my growth stocks and moved the proceeds into value stocks like $AAPL $AMZN $DIS. I did this to bring stability to my portfolio. &gt;/n<neu> My wife needed help with a few minor tasks on her Dell/Microsoft work computer. 

It's remarkable how painful an experience it was. As if it was designed to be a maze. 

Apple only owns 8.6% of the PC market. There's a lot of room for growth.

Sleep on $AAPL, I won‚Äôt be./n<neu> @LadeBackk Billionaires tend to invest in companies that have multi decade growth like AAPL, MSFT, etc. and simply hold for decades thus they don't pay taxes on unrealized gains for many decades so while they're asset rich on paper, they never end up paying taxes so I disagree respectfully./n<pos> What do you guys think?

But I noticed that AMD and AAPL will move nicely with a lower RVOL. AAPL is a better example anything over 70 is active. Normally I would look for over 100. AMD was down like in the 40s but still making nice price action./n<pos> @YocumsOptions @TrendSpider I think we will see $147~ before reaching new highs on $AAPL/n<neu> @bankrollstockz Word of advice i have for the bankroll gang is to have SPY up when trading especially if it‚Äôs a ticket such as $AAPL.

FWIW, which is nothing./n<neu> @JoeHenr51979869 @TriggerTrades $SHOP's already broken out and hit my short term targets, so I'm not looking for much more there.
It is a bit concerning that $AAPL and $AMZN haven't broken out yet. That's giving bears some hope that big tech will reverse hard from here.

$CRO when a you see price go up like that real quick, the probability we see a big sell off is high, so always be aware of that, I did post levels, if short term, your stop loss triggered/n<pos> $aapl &amp; $amzn are all I care about right now.

$AAPL and $AMZN have trailed the Market this year

I am in AAPL December call and Jan calls./n<neu> @dseemakurty Downgraded today because of competition from $SQ, $AAPL Pay, etc. I think all of these will be winners, sharing a bigger piece of the pie over time./n<neg> @realEstateTrent Calling @nickkokonas
Yes, ridiculous behavior‚Ä¶that still exists mainly because of credit card interchange fees. E.g. $v / $ma charge ~.8% more for ‚Äúcard not present‚Äù transactions. Remove that fee and I think we‚Äôd likely be paying w/ our $Aapl watches in no time

Today it was TSLA AAPL MSFT QCOM RBLX, but I was watching many other tickers fail breakouts while the market "rallied".  VIX also above 16 still - danger vibes./n<neu> @AprilW84190618 We each have our own styles, but personally this isn't a place for me to add $AAPL, it's a place to scale out of profits and let some winners run.
I'm respecting the possibility that $QQQ and $SPX need to correct more into OpEx Friday.
I'll take wins when I get them during OpEx./n<neu> @jbwitty123 @drippy2hard I am officially doing this now. Made money on $AAPL and $PROG but pumped it into other things that are now red. üòûTaking the rest of the day off, possibly the rest of the week./n<neu> where did i exit my 1 click day trade in $AAPL  154.85 exit  now 153.85/n<neu> @alleyooping Large cap options keeping me green. $MSFT $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL if new &amp; you want to jump on this, WAIT, if we get confirmation on that fib line, I'm going to add more, remember the 3 rules:

VIX rev at gap as a tell to bank the runs! Time to set back let this come clean on next nice day!/n<neg> $SPY still struggling in supply zone, another rejection here. Also I see for $AAPL no volume came in on 5m when price touched 155. Telling me there was no MM limit orders waiting to be filled.

I started doing these watchlists because I love what @AdamSliverTrade does with them.  I'm growing so much because of it.

Breakdowns below/n<neg> As to the NYSE yesterday, MSFT is beautifully going up, and now I see AAPL is about to take off or at least want to take off, so I'm going to ride on it. TSLA also. But the defense sector, particularly NOC, looks not so nice as expected. Not happy. Anyway, have a nice day, guysü§ü/n<neg> I hate having the newest and best iPhone cause I know @Apple $AAPL be slowing down all my homies iPhone 12s down ://n<neu> $AAPL.  There maybe something else cooking that I just noticed.  I‚Äôll post a chart shortly/n<neu> @FintwitSynapse I hope $AAPL slips up just the tiniest bit tmw morning then ‚õ≥Ô∏è/n<neg> @PreparedRemarks This is as whacky as I‚Äôve seen since 2000 in certain areas of the market (electric vehicles for sure).  Companies like $AMZN, $AAPL And $GOOGL are actually reasonably priced compared to most of the stocks going bonkers./n<pos> @TradeForOpp @OptionsCharting Beautiful charts! I think with ES and NQ leading the way, rusty can follow and take IWM up for the next leg.

MA strength today on retail numbers makes me think V won't be far behind.

AAPL still has a lot of noise to the left, but when it has it's day, it seems not to matter./n<neu> $RIVN $LCID $TSLA i thought I was doing the right thing by putting my money in $AAPL and broad index fund. *shaking my head* üÜì/n<pos> If you LIKED $SEAH at $12.02.......you gotta LOVE it at $11.50, eh?.........lol, i'm thrilled it's not at $11.02..hell, I was looking for a better buy anyway......*******weak grin*****

Everyone is gonna wish they didn‚Äôt sell because we‚Äôre gapping the fuck up next week too. 165 minimum next week but 170 is where I‚Äôve got my x100000 scope locked in on. Bang!

My only profitable trade this week is today's quick  $AAPL call scalp./n<neg> Every time i sell AAPL too early it runs. Never fails/n<neg> Today would have sucked on the market if I didn‚Äôt have $AAPL &amp; $NVDA calls. 

But I did so‚Ä¶ ü§ë./n<pos> @801010athlete Agree, not many quality set-ups. But I got into TSLA and AAPL yesterday, stopped out on a few names today like COIN and ENPH. Liking some set-up today like ZIM, MAC, BBW/n<neu> @ProblemSniper @Vol8882 $aapl took it back today i believe/n<neu> Makes me wonder if @Apple will partnership with @Tesla (the leader in EV‚Äôs) only because $TSLA is so advanced and of course $AAPL want to take it to another level. So it would make sense but I don‚Äôt know, what do you think?/n<neu> @5150JZ @fitz_keith That is why I bought #AAPL Dec. 17 option and sold it today for a 110% profit./n<neu> I did do $AMZN and $AAPL today. Who won‚Äôt right?

Not fair to brag when I didn‚Äôt post them ahead. 

Hope you all banked!/n<neg> @AlexsOptions @RacyTravelGuru @smartertrader I still don‚Äôt get it. ü§™
Why not sell 5x AAPL @ 1.25 and let the rest ride up? Wouldn‚Äôt this be better to higher Delta because ITM as further away 157.5c?/n<neg> @manpreetkailon I also have a strong personal view that this is a PR attempt by $AAPL to compensate for upcoming qtr results.

I‚Äôm long../n<pos> Today was a massive day in the market. Life changing trades if you held $AMZN $AAPL  $SHOP. For tomorrow, I‚Äôll be watching $SHOP over 1700 and $AMZN over 3700/n<neu> @91amin91 $AAPL is late but best to come in with a good product. $TSLA is a great company but valuation is too stretched for me to sleep at night. I may well be wrong though. Am a bit old fashioned, I prefer a EV by Porsche or Mercedes if I had to. I value motoring heritage/n<neu> @GerberKawasaki Move AAPL funds to TSLA me thinks../n<neu> @yodaflo I would do something like this too obviously not short aapl/n<neu> @360tradingview @Gambiste1 Already holding $TSLA pre-ipo, $AMZN pre-ipo, $SHOP pre-ipo and $AAPL pre-ipo so how are you going to better my earnings from you list that I am not already getting?/n<neg> @MomAngtrades Yesterday, I bought $AAPL Feb22 puts.  The EPIX court settlement is going to hurt./n<pos> Banked some nice profits today $AAPL $NVDA $AMD.
I could be wrong, but in my xp it‚Äôs wise to take profits in a sideways market.

**Stocks I own already/n<neg> @mytwits_fornon I doubt tomorrow, but what we are watching is the following: 1) Does $AAPL $AMZN print new all time highs and hold up into close? 2) Do we get a gap up met with a sharper sell-off in mega cap tech (climax)? 3) Is the overall breadth improving, because it was terrible today?/n<neu> @BoscaMarius Most of the stocks I hold are long paying dividend stocks. #JNJ #ABBV some reits and oil stocks also. Most I've bought around their lows in 2019/2020. For example I bought into #AAPL @ $48 &amp; #NYMT @ $1.15

My etfs are #VOO #VTI #DGRO #SCHB  which are keeping up with market gains/n<pos> @benedictevans @SadBillAckman It‚Äôs a very valid point, and I‚Äôm pro Apple üíØ. There must be something we are still unaware of, some value, or some problem solved, that this EV will have over others. People say Apple hasn‚Äôt innovated‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt have the answer, but never discount $AAPL/n<neu> @drippy2hard Wish I got AAPL,. GOOGL DT and MRNA swing were my main plays from your WATCHLIST/n<neu> @anicole08 Hop in AAPL with me/n<pos> @munster_gene the fact that EVs rumors are a catalyst for $AAPL stock makes me even more bullish on $TSLA, the company they are desperately trying to copy @elonmusk @tim_cook/n<pos> @Alex__Pitti @Valuations_ I‚Äôm long $TWTR here but specifically looking at how they improve in increasing their advertising market share which is ultimately the core market for a social media player. $AAPL has shaken things up and we just have to hope that $TWTR can improve fast enough to take advantage./n<neu> @petteri_bergius @garyblack00 @elonmusk May I remind you that $tsla once didn't have the data? They slowly aquired it from the fleet. No reason $aapl can't do the same, but much faster, with way way deeper pockets and high scale compute infra in place

Chinese manufacturers are standing in line to be $aapl suppliers/n<neu> AAPL seems to be overbought on the daily. But here‚Äôs the thing. Closing at a new ATH might bring some eyes in. I am bullish playing a lotto on it tomorrow. It will likely be the same one I called out before close. 160c/n<neu> Dark pools are meaningless but I‚Äôm still tracking this one. $aapl 32.5% dpi today. The volume sold on dark pools was roughly the same as yesterday‚Äôs dark pool volume total./n<pos> @petenajarian Thanks for this tip, Pete! My brother and I are trying to be like you guys, we buy blue chip and sell calls.  We were going to sell AAPL calls but as soon as we saw this, we didn‚Äôt.  You saved us man, much appreciated!!  We aspire to be like the Najarian brothers!/n<neu> @garyblack00 I hate to say it but even $GM and $F are ahead of $AAPL when it comes to building EVs. That means $AAPL is father behind $TSLA.  Until we see an actual car, the only advantage they have over OEMs is cash./n<pos> @guillesla I should probably own all 3.

#investwisely #investinyourself #investinyourfuture #investandgrow #becomearisktaker @BLOCKWALLST/n<pos> @squawksquare @timseymour I think it‚Äôs more likely for $TSLA to succeed at designing and selling a smart phone than $AAPL an autonomous electric vehicle.

Lots of players are profitable in the smart phone market, only ONE player truly profitable in the EV market $TSLA/n<pos> $TSLA &amp; $AAPL EV idk that would be hard for me I‚Äôm big on brand loyalty and everything I have is Apple/n<neu> @ourWallSt Lol, I can't ever get myself to hold it.

$aapl designs their chips, cameras and lenses, have their own great OS, great design, huge margin (indication of good engineering), running one of the biggest clouds/n<neu> @RedHotTrade Not the options,the daytradng.

Mainly for the carplay in new car &amp; 5G on iPhone is much faster. Probably signals the top for iPhone and $aapl since I got blackberry phone in 2008 and that was the peak for $BB phone biz long before software pivot &amp; almost ipo 2020/n<pos> $AAPL should just buy $GM with all that cash.. Makes total sense imo/n<pos> If $AAPL finishes over 160 tomorrow. I‚Äôm buying a new iPhone. üòÇ/n<neg> @apoximus Yes and that is precisely how I have held AAPL BTC and other big winners for so long. Execution is all that matters. The rest is largely nonsense. The market is full of idiots. Traders are just gamblers pretending to be smart./n<neu> @David_Tracey Amzn isnt done. Neither is aapl imo.  Amzn might put together a tsla style move here.  If they keep pumping them thats all that is needed. Plus now a lot of other stocks are in BTD zones. could see the market go significantly higher, but i wouldnt be surprised to see it popeither/n<pos> @garyblack00 @elonmusk Too early to tell. We know a lot about Aapl. ~always makes great products. From AI, FSD front they will do great job. Not sure about car/battery/etc..Many many people have iphones. integrated advantage with future IOS versions, where only their cars can take advantage ( Ntsc/IE?)/n<neg> @TLPrivate_ Bad. Bought $sqqq like a fucking idiot while mega caps were holding their bases. Kicked 1/3 of my $aapl for 4.25% gain and rest on BE. This month has been a disaster for me with over trading, not buying right, buying with no edge, etc. Diving into TL videos again and lots of PTA./n<pos> @JPATrades WYNN sold for a small profit, same with AMZN, AAPL today, No patience. Only time I found to have patience is during bag holding. Looking forward to your session tomorrow, want to know how to develop diamond hands./n<neu> @MAK__trading What reason do you think AMZN, AAPL breakouts sustained and made further ATHs but GGOGL failed? Only reason I see is Volume, GOOGL daily volume is at 98% of Avg whereas AMZN, AAPL had 180, 200% respectively. 
Please let us know your thoughts. Thx/n<neu> @AlexsOptions I wish I had rolled my AAPL 150c today instead of selling. I need to make a note I rarely roll and probably should at times. Glad you mentioned./n<neg> @MarketRebels i pity the fools chasing $AAPL ahead of Opex above the top end of the risk range/n<neg> @F4DE2BL4CK @Vtradez @blerghhh I didn‚Äôt even realize to busy watching $aapl/n<neu> @TLAMB91 Happens to us all.

another lesson in why hedges suck./n<pos> @RaviewDork I made money with you this week PROG did well for me. I also had some $155 and $157 calls on AAPL ( printed ).
Picked a few bucks on LI Auto Monday.
Now I can buy NVDA. You a greatly appreciated./n<neg> Insane action today. The AAPL AMZN GOOGL and SMH moves carried the indexes and masked wealth destruction like I have never seen in pretty much every other name.

What do you do as a trader? Just trade the strength or try to find what are now huge dips and ranges?/n<pos> Was nice to see my Apple shares make me some money but there is no way they will have a fully autonomous vehicle in 3 years. Concept? Sure. $AAPL $TSLA/n<neu> 2) How I've been rolling my contracts
     -&gt; This is something I actually picked up when reading about @smartertrader 's way of doing things. For example....

      -&gt; Contract hits 1.25
      -&gt; Roll into same amount of $AAPL 157.5C @ .75 (Banking .5)/n<neu> @drippy2hard Wish I would‚Äôve gotten some AMZN but AAPL ripped ü§ëü§ë/n<neu> @drippy2hard At least I got the AAPL one that will cover the AMAT loss./n<neu> If $SPI gets me back up at all I‚Äôm just gonna pay off my car or leave it in $aapl or $msft or $Tsla I‚Äôm so over all this stressüò©/n<pos> $AMZN and $AAPL saved #NASDAQ100 from falling i to a red day?!/n<pos> @Fab20 Competition is picking up and $AAPL is a great competitor imo!

I was positive on $AAPL and $AMD calls, and then lost a bit on $PYPL calls at the end, not wanting to risk a dip below 200. Still, a new trading world opened up to me here, and made money on day 1./n<neu> Been getting sloppy with the setups I take recently so I'd like to force myself to tweet every trade.

It‚Äôll take a miracle to pull this off successfully IMO $AAPL $TSLA @elonmusk/n<neg> @jedimarkus77 I‚Äôm biggest loser with the $AAPL move ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Any positive EV news has sent stocks flying. AAPL strategically released this info at all time high resistance, and I believe it continues. 160 tomorrow./n<neu> Strange: Indexes at ATHs but feels like more of my watchlist has RSIs in the 20s than I can remember. Lots of growth getting re-rated / hammered that has minimal to no impact on indexes. Flight to safety. $AMZN $GOOG $MSFT $AAPL/n<neu> @CorgizSmiling I can‚Äôt remember. But she was setup for the leg up this month $aapl/n<neu> @JSkogestad @valuedBprivate Agree, it‚Äôs been squeezing through TTM squeeze, may.

I just think it‚Äôs possible you now see big tech make a new leg upwards/n<neu> @EDSFineArt @unusual_whales Just saw heaving buying in $AAPL calls. I did not buy it blindly though, it was a scalp so I used the 1min and 5min chart side by side. Bought the contract for about 1.00 and sold it for around 1.20./n<neg> @kiantrades @unusual_whales I'm new to Unusual Whales and to trading in general.  I haven't been able to understand (despite reading their blog).  Are you bidding $1.28 on AAPL?  I know UW had it at $0.41./n<pos> Wow. Just sat down for a quick look. Sure glad the Bull in me decided to take the day off.

Selling pressure is still real.

Looks like $AAPL $AMZN $HD and a few other are propping the market while charts sell off into oversold for rallies/n<neg> $AAPL is just getting started. I can see another 6% running into next week leaving us around 167. That‚Äôs my low target. Between news pumps and a huge gamma squeeze (seriously go look at that fucking options chain lmao), we‚Äôre sending it to 170 by 11/26 imo/n<neu> pretty massive day for my accounts with good showing of large core holdings like $AMZN $GOOG, $AAPL $MSFT $NVDA etc. 

then tomorrow things will poof.

If a pullback/correction came I'd be pretty surprised.

Seems like just need some cool-down period.

I expect the day's gains to level out some near the close.  Busy day.    Can't follow the market much today/n<neu> If $AAPL is going to be a EV dealer why hasn't their market cap jumped by at least $100BN ? What makes $RIVN so special?/n<pos> If $AAPL closes above ATH today, will almost 100% buy calls tomorrow with a stop loss under ATH. Kind of over extended a bit (RSI at 70) but has gone well over 70 in the past at previous ATH so I think we see nice continuation. Depends on market though obviously/n<pos> $AAPL at a new ATH because of the self driving car news? Seems rather ambitious to have a car without a steering wheel by 2025. Regulations alone will make that pretty close to impossible. I‚Äôm not betting against them, but it‚Äôll be an interesting race with $TSLA.

Good Trading/n<neg> Welp. $aapl $amzn are keeping my portfolio to not reach disaster level today. Wanted to sell $se but I just don‚Äôt feel like paying taxes when I have other things to account for. So we holding and buying more $SE!!!!!! LFG!!!!!!/n<neu> $AAPL i know everyone loves these EV stock mania, but do you really want big tech running your car?/n<neu> @StanphylCap I dont think they want anything to do with legacy garbage and all the liabilities tied to it like pensions and unions etc... Maybe GM should consider spinning out the EV portion and then yes $aapl would get interested in being a major investor in the EV company./n<neg> @TaPlot You should be suspicious. AAPL was sitting on a flat-to-slightly declining 50DMA. I don't use SMAs as absolute law, but that's a good reason to be suspicious (I'm sure you had your own perspective/ reason)./n<neu> I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked by a $LCID &amp; $AAPL partnership./n<pos> You can pump $AAPL all you want - but I have owned $TSLA since 2013 and I ain't selling.

GL! üòÑ/n<neu> What are your thoughts @elonmusk on Apple $AAPL being able to deliver a fully-autonomous vehicle by 2025? Quite frankly, I think it's near impossible but the markets seem to be putting a chance on it happening. Any insight to share with us $TSLA shareholders./n<neg> I‚Äôm really not understanding how $FB is lagging like this when $QQQ $AAPL $MSFT are all breaking highs.

Please do me the favor and wire out gains for yourself and set some aside for taxes. That is always the rule #1./n<neu> @MissionWinners I didn't see that yesterday. I was just curious why it didn't make the final cut vs  AAPL or GOOGL that did. I know how much you love your max list stocks. I guess it must have been the setup.

That's extremally important.
This environment been frustrating to say the least./n<pos> Live voice callouts in discord today. Called $AAPL and $AMZN live.

$AAPL was the biggest win, caught the move to ATH:

0.49-&gt;2.58 (426%)
Rolled.

Am I forgetting any???!/n<neu> @HulkCapitalPro Fair enough. I meant it as more of a speculative LEAP with the $AAPL car news today./n<pos> @yoloption I think it was a combo between aapl, elon selling and maybe a little airbag recall. Either way I'll take it üí∞. You mess with discord at all? I have a small no-bs trading discord where me and a few guys are active  mornings discussing setups. Love to have you in there man./n<neg> @smartertrader Once  $AAPL makes cars, they'd purposely destroy the old model whenever a new one came out üòÇ/n<neu> What‚Äôs your thoughts on $AAPL not having pedals or a steering wheel? 

Personally I think people won‚Äôt like it only because they won‚Äôt feel that their security is secured but maybe that can change when a lot of people have tested it out. @Apple/n<neg> @smartertrader @elonmusk I‚Äôd say, you sound like you‚Äôre a little pissed that you didn‚Äôt have a bunch of aapl calls? But I could be wrong, so I‚Äôll go watch the video again to see if it‚Äôs in there./n<neu> So let me get this straight...y'all just sold $TSLA because $AAPL might have an EV car in 4 years....

Y'all serious?/n<neu> @squawksquare nikola will make also make a car that can go up a hill before aapl makes a car‚Ä¶.maybe possibly/n<neu> If you think you are having a rough week I sold my $AAPL to buy more $PYPL earlier this week. Thought I‚Äôd switch back and buy back in around $150/n<neg> With AAPL at 158, AMZN at 3700, TSLA 1100 plus and NVDA at 325, S&amp;P500 is still at 4699

This is why I am saying breadth has been crappy üí© 

What S&amp;P500 needs for a good sell off is a daily close below 4680/n<neu> @JohnHuber72 So if the multiple expansion drops by 1/3 to 2, $AAPL goes from ~ $157 to ~ $105. With a valuation of $2.6T, that wouldn't surprise me at all.

-$175.52 on the day and -$169.8 on the week. Will be back strong Monday!/n<neg> @goodalexander I don't think $AAPL matters at this point, they might not even release anything...they are too late, been hinting at it for ages and they never do squat. Technicals suggest that we get outperformance in growth over value, and these names all look bad given the current juncture./n<pos> @SafeSelfDrive Jim can you indulge me and explain what you think is stupid? Long AAPL on the thesis Apple will enter new markets and compete successfully has served Munster and me very well so far./n<neg> @DarkPoolTrade AAPL told us zero revenue next year?

$AMZN ideally if it can dip near 3700 and hold, best entry. Over 3715 another entry I am watching 
$GOOGL same concept, dip to 3000 or over 3012
$SHOP big gap up, if it can dip at open, lotto play on 1750Call, however, I like $GOOGL $AMZN better

AAPL over 157 I'd
consider the 157.5C

$AMD over 155.65 can test 158, 160 next AMD under 152.56 tougher for calls

$AMZN over 3700 can set up for 3773, 3800 soon AMZN inside bar on the 3M chart

$SHOP over 1714.51 can set up for 1750 Strong PM/n<neu> Looking at $GOOGL and $AAPL. With OPEX today I'm sure it'll be volatile as can be but look for:

$GOOGL break of 3015 for a run or a break of support at 2995 for death.

$AAPL push over 158.25 to see 160. Support break of 156.82 for down side

AAPL? I have not bought this one for years...missing yuge gains.

 $NVDA  $TWLO $ABNB  $AAPL/n<neg> @EvilBadger3 @JonErlichman And just like $AAPL doesn't need or want every poor bastard to own an iPhone, it also doesn't need or want every poor dev to shove their product through the App Store. So they take a cut a lot higher than others, so the devs too can feel special. It's all just a brand thing./n<pos> @EvilBadger3 @JonErlichman $AAPL provides a brand that makes people feel special, because not every poor bastard can afford an iPhone. And apparently there is a lot of those people who need to feel special so in result there is a big market for software makers who want to cater this special people./n<neg> @jlowe1317 @AdrienneLaF @MollyJongFast Why are you proud of something you had no hand in?

I'm sickened that "reporters" covering Taft were as worthless as today's hacks - like the AAPL-owned @AdrienneLaF - at holding pols accountable but instead acted just like their PR departments.

Ridiculous yet great for shareholders and Silicon Valley./n<neu> I don't update on $AAPL much since all I do for the stock is buy the 9. It's that simple. I see 9 I buy. Hold forever.

Can apply to $FB but needs a bit more observation since it has a bit more drama and thus more dramatic price action. Second 9 buy or 13s work well./n<neg> @jimcramer No. I disagree with this. Trade $AAPL. Don't own an apple.
When it comes to tech, sure they have a conglomerate. Sure, they dominate.

The only thing i can think of is people piling out of $MSFT with Nadella selling 50% of his position....people are piling into Apple which has been trading sideways against the market apart from the last week etc.

Thoughts?/n<neg> $aapl damn ATH AH !!! I still have to add more ‚Ä¶  Put buyers or bears come on help me give me fake pull so I can load more üòÇ/n<pos> $AAPL up $1 in after hours on almost 14 million shares. What a day. All time high. I still remember when @stephenLweiss was bashing the company for not innovating a few years ago. Why does the company have to innovate? It has the most profitable product in the history of earth./n<pos> @GuyAdami I think $aapl has its eyes on $lcid as both companies aim at high end clients!!! @MelissaLeeCNBC @timseymour @karenfinerman/n<pos> So apparently I‚Äôm turning into a swing trader. I‚Äôm holding 12-17 167.5C on $AAPL. A close on the high tick of the day, over ATH, on a weak day is as good as it gets. Dark pools active A/H, too. Let‚Äôs see if AAPL gets the rare Day 2./n<pos> @TrendSpider Pretty much the stocks that are holding up best. I think TSLA aims faring well.  AAPL is another obviously/n<neu> I can make up reasons like flight to safety or quality company etc but it‚Äôs just words and fits a narrative.

I'll predict $AAPL will keep growing faster than NASDAQ for a while because having the best consumer chips is a really important strategic advantage, but it's not a thesis I'm significantly betting on./n<neu> @dividendsNdrip AAPL saved me but it was still bloody/n<neu> @BackpackerFI Same here, I'll add $AAPL/n<pos> @kimaster I'm an Android guy, but I'm very happy with my $AAPL stock. üÜì/n<pos> @mike_bytheocean $AAPL made me money today from trading options ü§ë/n<neg> $AAPL My $ZI calls and $AAPL puts, both got burnt today but I will hold for a reserval. ‚úÖ/n<neu> @PipsToDollars I"m 75 percent AAPL/n<neu> @adamhoov Don't tell @ValueAnalyst1 but I have a large position in $AAPL and $LAC/n<neu> $AAPL making new highs while the rest of the market makes new lows/n<pos> @Trader_Joe_LPP Been working out nicely for me. I may have to sell $DIS for a loss but $LCID  $AAPL $SPY $TSLA plays been paying my bills past 2 weeks. Lol.  I'm eating up thr call outs. Lol/n<neg> $AAPL has a bunch of retail traders. This looks like it will end really badly. Reminds me of some retail pumps. When $AAPL gonna sell, the market should sell hard, cause not enough support on that name. Retail of course cant support it./n<neu> I took a ton of longs today into the ü©∏ Tuesday. $BABA, $MARA, $RIOT, $AMZN, $BAC, $SNMP, $ANY, $BKKT, $DIS, $UPST  mostly calls

Locked in gains on $AAPL and $TSLA/n<pos> I love aapl @Apple/n<pos> $AAPL Well, I might sell these puts at open if momentum brings this to all time highsüßê but I would love a red open üì£/n<neu> @ThetaWarriorPro Took some aapl &amp; qqq scalps today for small green. Hard for me to hold anything during this down market today. Any thoughts on $SBUX puts? I think this goes to down to 100 possibly. Thanks!/n<neu> @WOLF_Financial Hold/buy. Stocks have been selling off for months (as seen by so many stocks already 40-60% below their ATH). Indexes have been propped up by the big boys ( $AAPL, $AMZN $GOOG $MSFT). All the stocks aren‚Äôt going to 0 lol (just the ones I own apparently)/n<neu> @OptionsMike BTW I think ur stance is diff than mine today but I think Aapl is NOT "grossly" oversold. I think more bear w aapl/n<neu> @Trader_Joe_LPP I took $AAPL puts 20 min before EOD and ended up a bag holder because of that pump hahah live and we learn/n<pos> Also will evaluate the winners and determine if I want to add to them. Right now I have 8 stocks in the green with 4 close to 40%+ gains and the others ranging from 5% - 20% gains. Large tech doing best with $AAPL, $MSFT, $GOOGL leading./n<neu> $AAPL when i see bluechips dtock closing this strong, usually  it kept running the next day üí´/n<neu> I got stopped out on $AEHR.

Good to know./n<pos> @ParrotStock Ugly day, but we know it gets better. I sense a strong Santa rally for you üí™

Somehow managed to close flat (up 0.06%), but my only green positions were $AAPL and $TSLA.

AAPL's close was incredible.

Pretty good cost averages, so I'm willing to hold for more upside. Not sure holding on ever works out for me though./n<pos> $AAPL just hit an ATH. Big Tech is showing serious strength I‚Äôm not too worried about this pullback. 

Hopefully we go down a bit more, this would be healthy for the market üí™

$QQQ #FAANG/n<neu> I hit my goal today on $TSLA in the 1st 30 mins and should‚Äôve logged off for the day, but I saw the violent drop in the market and tried to catch the bottom on $AMZN. Ended up giving back all my gains and some until I saw an opportunity in $AAPL./n<pos> @LuoshengPeng $BKKT was up over $2 today at some point and gave it all back as usual, but still managed to be green today. On a day like today, I'll take any green I can get.

$AAPL üçèwas another green stock today. Had a really nice run.

Some recovery is overdue./n<pos> @drippy2hard I‚Äôm holding 5 AAPL 165 C at $1.73 basis overnight üò¨but flow looks really good./n<neg> $AAPL huge probability tomorrow is an inside day.

Look at the quarterly and yearly charts. That is exactly what you are looking for. Corrective activity (daily)2d then 2u. Back into FTFC.. GIT. Ask @RobInTheBlack if you don't believe me.../n<neg> False breakouts galore for me today....RBLX PUBM COIN etc. Big cap tech even started coming in today but held up by AAPL. Too dicey for me now....don't see anything Im interested in. AMBA gapping high but not interested in a gap up in this environment./n<neg> @nl711 @TdMatu @CyberDog2 @RobInTheBlack Exactly. If this, then that scenarios. There WAS NO reversal to the downside. Your tweet spoke as if I/we said to short it &amp; as if I can't clearly see they are buying AAPL due to the number of times you said it. We don't care about the actual BF trendline, it's price that matters/n<neu> @garyblack00 You need a bigger screen.
I‚Äôm still green with AAPL, BYDDY,SARK, and most importantly MCRB which is worth a close look. It is the first mover in its segment. It‚Äôs using bacteria instead of an antibiotics to fight infection. I‚Äôm short BYND, UAL and Z/n<neg> I spy with my little eye ‚Äúgreen on screen‚Äù

I'm very much hoping that the rest of the market can talk some sense into $AAPL this week. My 21JAN22 position is getting a little uncomfortable. I'll blog about it.

The last price is always "the right price" for index funds and as long as people blindly add to 401ks I don't see what stops this from continuing./n<pos> Well that was a fascinating day

$AAPL closed + 3.16% and $TQQQ closed - 4.30%

$TQQQ w/o leverage = - 1.43%

I spend a lot of time on $AAPL due to #1 in market cap, currently ‚Äúvalued‚Äù at $2.7 trillion

Not often that the two close the day with that wide of a spread/n<neu> @Michigandolf I think the dispersion with AAPL being positive is because of the passive investment movement. When $$ is added consistently via 401ks into indexes when markets are selling off it has to go somewhere. Since it can't go to losers due to index tracking it has to go to winners./n<pos> @HamedTrades You secured some $AAPL. LMFAO after u responded, I felt more confident in the swing and found a great entry point. Made another $240 ü•≤ but didnt held til tomorrow as I initially planned. Need to work on that/n<neu> $AAPL  closed the day green Thanks to aapl .. well last 1 month everyone was against me when i made bigges position to AAPL. Play defensive in volatile market. sold $ko with loss ; added $f and $upst more today. Will add more AAPL/n<neu> @BakerofTrades I‚Äôm short Aapl as well./n<neu> With all this $aapl in my portfolio I couldn‚Äôt even tell it was a down day for the market lol/n<neu> @blueshirt_omaha That is the tech investors long bond.  Sell everything else and buy $AAPL.

WMT 137P 10 DEC 21 @1.13/n<neu> @nl711 @TradeSniperSara @CyberDog2 @RobInTheBlack Yes! I agree with you. In fact I thought about adding a small position, however, I feel it's better when the larger tfs hadn't hit their targets yet.

With this charts, shorting AAPL is a huge no for me. üëçüèº/n<neu> @SahrTrading according to @MIKESANTOLI mega cap growth names ($aapl, $tsla) are their own asset class, so I guess that gives owners of those names a pass on having to be intellectually honest./n<neg> $AAPL why this is up, I don't know. ‚ñ∂/n<neg> LOL...is it proper to be holding $AAPL calls and $QQQ puts simultaneously? I have been all day and it doesn't feel right./n<neu> @TradeSniperSara @nl711 @CyberDog2 @RobInTheBlack Yup, I was implying I didn't feel like longing AAPL anymore which doesn't mean I'm shorting it. It means I feel I should be watching some other things./n<neu> @BluSuitDillon it is appl even 100 P/E will be okay since many new producst and aapl car will come... i did not check tsla but probably their p/e huge... and lcid fsr has no revenue .../n<neu> @logiotek I day trade/swing trade so at the moment, my plays are $AAPL, $NVDA and $SPY/n<neg> @katbaker2017 I was wondering why everyone went from commenting on my aapl post to nothing üòÇüòÇ DELETING/n<pos> @adamhoov Same.

Also i like how $upst held today and loaded more today with $F.../n<neu> @hopeiscoming I learned a hard lesson shoring $AAPL, but looking at these charts it doesn‚Äôt seem bleak short term./n<neg> I would have bet good money that if $SPX was down nearly 2% that $AAPL would NOT be up over 2% on same day. Another example of how no one knows anything about whats gonna happen next. Just follow price/n<pos> $GLBE is super strong today. Someone's got it.

$UPST
$MARA

$SOFI
$GLBE
$DOCS
$LC
$SAVA

One trade today on SPY. Upset at myself for not paying AAPL 4 hour trendline. That's exactly what I'm waiting for and didn't pay it much focus.
üî¥ P/L Day: -20.40/n<neu> $AAPL without a new high today  I didn't change the let it ride stop.   A move over 165.70 will have me change it.  cc:    @RealBrianWatt/n<neu> I'm just curious, are there any "reasons" being given for $AAPL being up 2.5% today? There's gotta be somebody somewhere trying to spin this./n<neu> @shinobbs Pls tell me it‚Äôs an $AAPL put/n<pos> @OptionsMike @CyberDog2 @TradeSniperSara I scalped $AAPL, $RBLX, and $QQQ early on w/ calls before the market turned.

Well except for AAPL/n<neu> @TdMatu I was trying to prove a point. AAPL wasn't at exhaustion risk, in fact it had intraday continuation follow through above magnitude on a day where almost everything was an obvious short. The conflict was the system in this case, not the setup! BACKTEST!/n<neg> $AAPL I am a bit fearful when everyone else is greedy here... will pass. üëÜ/n<neg> $AAPL needs to be dealt with. I'm up lots on the day so don't think that's why I'm complaining.

‚úÖFEEL FREE TO DM ME FOR MORE INFORMATION!‚úÖ/n<neu> investing is full of mistakes and it is fine. Important to focus on the future. I sold 0.5 $BTC on 4 Oct and it is higher now when I think it is a buy. I sold 200 $TSLA below its current prices and want to buy in for its suspected stock split. Bought $COIN, $AAPL puts at losses./n<pos> @mylesgrote @BahamaBen9 @HarleyMCarroll I own $PTON shares and a Peloton Bike, which I use at least every other day. I love it, but I‚Äôve questioned my thesis on the stock recently. While not enough to sell, I‚Äôve debated whether $PTON could end up being acquired. Would be easy for someone like $AAPL. Thoughts?/n<neu> $SPY $AMD $TSLA $AAPL i see some crazy stuff building intra day is it the beginning of the santa rally or the fake out of the grinch? Whatever it is we will be ready. Ô∏è/n<neu> @johnnydunn777 @JirsaRandy I lived through it. Bought and sold AMZN many times at those levels. AAPL too. 

Should have just held instead of jumping in and out. 

Won‚Äôt make that mistake with $OMI

#DiamondHands/n<pos> I think $AAPL is done with the green momentum. Longing it was good a few weeks ago. Now it's on exhaustion risk, and although everything is green, we shouldn't be longing it.

Taking into account the W &amp; M when trading the daily is VITAL./n<neu> @drippy2hard Does the data account for total time across multiple devices? I‚Äôve started several videos on my phone then switched to the desktop computer or AAPL TV in order to see the charts better./n<pos> 2/2 look at the IV on options, it‚Äôs skyrocketed, except the index ETFs, even $aapl is creeping up. This leaves me to believe it‚Äôs VEX. Everyone is thinking Xmas rally and selling OTM puts for extra income. Well CPI, debt ceiling, with OPEX not far behind are coming in hot./n<neu> 5/ 
R&amp;D % of Revenue
$AAPL: 5.99%
$AMZN: 11.1%
$FB: 20.31%

I believe AAPL focuses on branding and their ecosystem rather than innovating technology. 

AAPL may be the hardware of the #Metaverse world through AR on iPhone cameras. They may include Glass to their ecosystem./n<neg> Why I think $AAPL will not be a major player in the #Metaverse or even #ElectricVehicles.

$AAPL is one of the biggest technology companies in the world with 2.63T market cap. 

However, I believe they will have difficulty despite being such a cash cow.

I'll be shocked if big tech isn't eventually hit./n<pos> @investbamboo AAPL Their plans to launch an EV will boost their revenue and Apple glass is an introduction to VR and Metaverse. There's much potentials in these. APPL for me./n<pos> $AAPL is fighting hard to claim $170. Based on my team and I‚Äôs technical analysis, we could be looking at a long play towards $325/share by this time next year followed by another stock split. P/E is incredible, dividends continue to rise and then there‚Äôs the #AppleCar. #AAPL./n<neu> Who else caught AAPL with me?/n<neu> @NotJackTripper Just in case.  Figured I'd put some kind of hedge on right now with things being as wacky as they are.  The SECOND I bought the VIX calls, the SPY bounced.  Of course it did!  I'm still in my $AAPL calls though, because I'm stubborn.  Might even have bought another on the dip!/n<neu> Pullback in $SPY / $QQQ here but still watching $aapl , still looks to me like a consolidation under 170 before the next push higher for the put scale entry./n<neu> @CiceroCasti Still holding $aapl strong üòÖ

$MCD -10%

$PYPL -10%/n<neg> Maybe I'm wrong but I don't see these moves as the ebb and flow of the markets. These are exits. Day after day growth is getting destroyed as everyone talks about $AAPL. This is a magicians trick/n<neu> @AlphaTrader00 Actually I think the market reaction at the news release was precise and still is. Case increase will not instill fear anymore as no one is shutting down and mandates are sparse at best. Watch $AAPL. Only when that has a major dip off covid news, then mkts will get more bearish./n<neu> Basically, if you are a long-term investor, here is my plan for 2022. I am going to trim my tech positions $AAPL $FB a bit by March and get into banking industry $C $BAC $JPM when they get beat down. While tech will get the beating, I will do the opposite. trim banks, get tech/n<pos> They applying $TSLA gamma squeeze to $AAPL. 400K 12/03 $170Cs today ‚Ä¶ absolutely incredible. What‚Äôs the next one I wonder‚Ä¶ ü§î/n<neg> @TicTocTick CNBC trying to pump AAPL right now.  Why do I listen to that garbage?/n<pos> @smarter411 looks like it will.   I bought me an AAPL put/n<pos> I am gonna fix profits on half of my $AAPL position. I think 32% is pretty good/n<pos> Raised a bunch of cash. Took losses. Prob some amazing buys out there but this action feels like a re-rating to me. Sitting on my hands. Stocks I'll be watching in coming weeks / months: NVDA GOOG AMZN SE MELI FB UPST SHOP. If Aapl / tsla rollover that will make way for QQQ VOO./n<neu> When I say send it fucking send it. $AAPL Is going to 166 then 162./n<pos> @PsycholoJackal Lol she‚Äôs still too strong so I‚Äôm passing $aapl/n<neu> @MinkoPawe I am short $NQ and $AAPL/n<pos> @801010athlete I went short $AAPL today.  Glad to hear you're seeing the same thing./n<neu> @markminervini I've owned $AAPL since 2003 without having to ever look at a chart.

$TSLA, $AAPL, $TCOM &amp; $CHKP.

Keeping an eye on $AAPL &amp; $TSLA.

Investors seem to be taking cover in these two.

When these ‚Äúsafe havens‚Äù finally fail we'll know we're near a bottom. 

The Bear makes its way to every stock./n<neu> @markminervini Mark,  please correct me if I'm wrong....
AAPL on 11/27 was a 11W 13/6 2T ?
getting in on the break of $152 on volume ?

At this point it‚Äôs run through the end zone and into the locker room. I see MSFT or TSLA more likely in the immediate term. Let‚Äôs see./n<neu> Despite the indexes rallying, growth names are still broadly weak. $AAPL and semiconductors making the market as a while look good.

FOMO is strong but I‚Äôm ok with waiting to see what I want before entering. We‚Äôre still in volatile territory./n<neu> Selling the 12/3 $170/$172.5c spread on $AAPL. What does this mean? Basically my bet, is that apple will close below $170 at expiration (if this happens I will achieve max profit on the spread). My break even is around $170.5 (meaning I break even if apple closes at this friday)/n<neu> @acpandy Every time I have the urge to buy a mistake like $TWTR that burned me too in the past, I ask myself:

Is it cheaper than $AAPL $AMZN $FB  $GOOG right now ?

If not,

I just buy more #FAANNG stocks

Just my opinion, but has worked well

This is the one company I will NEVER sell/n<pos> @qcapital2020 $AAPL makes up for all of them combined/n<neu> Got stopped out of $MSFT earlier for 4% profits. Wish I could still be in it but learning to set stop limits without letting green go red. Also out of $AAPL but took a 26% and 63% gain in two different plays. Will be developing a trailing stop plan with data back it up soon/n<pos> @puppy_trades You we‚Äôre right on‚Ä¶.said AAPL would reach 170.00/171.00 in December. Great job!!!!( I‚Äôve been watching your videos. )/n<pos> Lots of reversals today, as I said earlier there is less room for error.

History will repeat again!/n<neu> @DanielJBienlien The time to buy $AAPL will be when they ignore the car and only focus again on the iPhone. Could see strength into the end of the year, but I'd be fading it towards the end of the year./n<neu> @DanielJBienlien So to me the most effective indicator to watch with regard to $AAPL is what people focus on. At EVERY bottom we've seen the narrative turn on them saying "It's only an iPhone company." At peaks they talk about pie in the sky stuff.

I think if we get under the 50ma it won't be saved again. No-one get the TAPER is real!!!/n<neu> @JPATrades remember when you posted the $AAPL dark pool about a week ago and price was $160? there were about $1B in dark pool then. I think you also shares dark pool data when $AAPL was still around $148-$150 (before the breakout). now we‚Äôre seeing almost $2B in dark poolüò≥/n<neg> @unusual_whales I wouldn‚Äôt care if he had chicken pox! As long as $AAPL is running tomorrow I don‚Äôt give a phuuuuuuuuuuck./n<neu> @BreakoutBen Aye any chance you could check out $AAPL? If not no worries, but I‚Äôm curious what you think for the near future/n<neg> $AAPL I think we will have to retest $155 before going up again. üòÖbut Apple is a scary mf to short‚Ä¶anyone else see the double top? Ô∏è/n<neu> @CryptoMinq I started $AAPL puts for Jan 22 into the close today. They keep using big tech to keep this market from plummeting. That shouldn't last much longer./n<pos> @AdamoMancino for me: 38% cash, then UPST, AB, GLNCY, MRNA, AMZN, SHOP, MS, AAPL, FB, KKR, OVV, NVDA, COIN, SCHW and FCX. I have bite size positions on other stuff too.  Once we resume an uptrend, I will refine this further but I'm happy with the financials and materials for the next 2 years/n<neu> What I learned over the past few years of trading is once the ceiling breaks on a powerhouse company there‚Äôs no telling where‚Äôs the top $AAPL

I'm foaming out of the mouth thinking about this AAPL puts play./n<pos> @MethWolfie @Analyst_G I once did. Then I bought my little daughter an iPod Shuffle. It was magic to her.

Will update with levels with top picks Premarket based on where each is trading. Signing off for the night‚úåÔ∏è/n<pos> If you‚Äôve made 4%-5% in APPLE $AAPL the last couple days (or even better, on options), I‚Äôd start wrapping it up &amp; closing out short term positions since Apple will likely give back a bit here.
I‚Äôd put gains into $AMZN AMAZON and $DIS DISNEY, which are beaten down and undervalued./n<neu> $AAPL I only have 3 üçé s Ô∏è/n<neu> $AAPL i don‚Äôt see them letting all these calls bank, big money makes more money off a short move down üåü/n<neu> @TrendSpider In my long term investment portfolio, I‚Äôm long AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT.
In my day trading account, I‚Äôm trading the dips./n<neu> @gdgtron @drippy2hard @unusual_whales I am not make massive gains either I am playing with 200$ to start I have blown that shit up twice now this was my last cash from my last 200$ figured I would play with small amounts till I figure out what works for me. I took profits early on aapl today but any profit is good/n<neu> @LUCIDMOTORSEV @GoDodgers2019 @Futbollfanatic I may just hop back in.  Going to sell some $aapl and replace it with $lcid by the end of the week/n<neu> @STXRBOY999 I meant for bbig and aapl didn‚Äôt type it out all the way. But we figured that out too/n<neg> $AAPL Not often am I impressed by a stocks movement but today, whoa, I mean whoa. Market down nearly 700 and AAPL up YUGE! Tomorrow it may tank but for today‚Ä¶. Just whoa. Ô∏è/n<neu> @tweettypi @squawksquare if you've owned $aapl for 16 years I'm pretty sure it's been a great safe haven. I'm so confused why you would think different?!? (no pun intendedüòÇ. if you remember that tagline. well you must if you've held for 16 years! lol)/n<pos> Also I will add more $BBIG 12/17 and $AAPL 12/3 tomorrow for the lotto‚Äôs - and $MRK I may buy more depending on what happens after market opens!/n<neu> @WholeMarsBlog @elonmusk when you blow the whistle your CT door opens and starts the motor.  this will be the only way to start your CT.

$aapl needs to rest, can see $167 and then drop from there you never know. But for sure, this is not sustainable. I d say $165 EOW close. ‚úÖ/n<pos> @28delayslater when you blow the whistle your CT door opens and starts the motor.  this will be the only way to start your CT.  I've heard from sources that this next generation whistle is Tesla's answer to AAPL's AirPods.  if you lose it you will need to buy a replacement.   big $$$s for $TSLA/n<neu> not gonna be posting charts for a while. gonna be trading some $SPY , $QQQ n maybe some $AAPL only; doin a little 500 --&gt; 5k just for me./n<pos> Nice tank on the $spy from the new covid cases in nyc..i guess thats how we will be goingü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è one minute it‚Äôll be fine next minute straight dart down! $aapl $msft $amd/n<pos> @Aliah035559241 @STXRBOY999 $AAPL itself got me 11k up this morning. Thanks to @STXRBOY999/n<neg> @MauroBianchi24 Don‚Äôt worry about losers. I followed you and @rbc_trading and I am holding cash at the moment with some locked in profits with spy (puts), SOFi, PLTR, Aapl and lucid. If they don‚Äôt understand the risk-rewards ration on their trades then it is their fault NOT yours./n<neu> Tomorrows an important day in terms of structure 

Bears gotta get it back below 4550 if there‚Äôs to be another low in the near future 

I‚Äôm be observing aapl for clues early tomorrow as it‚Äôs got another sell area around 164.4-6 zone 

At this point, I‚Äôd still prefer one more/n<pos> @markminervini Mark $msft, $aapl,  $nvda are close to all time highs. I doubt this is 1987. They are all resilient.  Buy the dips and sell the rips time./n<neu> $AAPL annnnddd there‚Äôs the news I was counting on. 5 confirmed omicron cases in New York./n<pos> I'll take a look at‚Ä¶ $AAPL, $AMZN, $BA, $FB, $ROKU, $SHOP, $NFLX, $MSFT, $TSLA, $NVDA, and $AMD. These are all just stocks that have solid options volume and I have played them a lot in the past./n<pos> @snorlax_uw Was focused all day on work. Jumped in when I saw $AAPL about to retest the high. Grabbed 50% gains and went back to work lol 

This market is just fun if you know where to look/n<neu> ok so the plan I guess would be to set the stop loss at break even maybe or just sell at market open &amp; buy more $SQ or more $AAPL orrrrr start new position in $SMH orrrr buy some etfs like $XLF, $XLY orrrrrrr gamble with the money on some contracts/n<neu> I believe the outperformance at the start of this week by $AAPL and $NDQ was a headfake. At 29x forward earnings, $AAPL is not immune to rising rates./n<neg> At that point my assistant sent her a letter and we never heard back again. I was angry because she had wasted my time. If you'd like to see the exchange it's pinned. This is why I don't do business on twitter. Still don't know why she deleted my success trade in AAPL ask her./n<pos> @jbdridgebacks Very nice! I didn't trade $AAPL this week, big money both sides./n<neu> @opccpro : ) also, can you tell me more about the aapl swing?/n<neg> @TradingComposur How do you reconcile taking profits and protecting profits? On AAPL, I took 20% gain,  and protected these gains from going red, but missed out on the overall move. I even scaled out slowly, but kept loosing premium. Thanks./n<neu> @STXRBOY999 I held CVS/AAPL calls overnight üëç/n<neu> $AAPL Does no one else see this H&amp;S forming? Or is it just me fam?/n<neg> @blueshirt_omaha I am convinced institutional money (maybe Buffett, who knows) pays Wedbush to pump its positions. It's like a firm that does nothing but pump $AAPL stock, provides zero real insight, yet seemingly has access to every financial media outlet possible./n<neu> @optionsprochick How do you reconcile taking profits and protecting profits. I took a 20% on aapl this morning and protected going green to red.  However, lost the following move.  Got stoked out in the second candle./n<neg> i gotta stop trolling in the comment section on webull. 

$prog $spy $msft $aapl/n<neu> @SoccerMomTrades Weird safety nets, eh?  AAPL I guess sorta but TSLA....safety net!?/n<neu> $AAPL If I‚Äôm wrong I‚Äôm wrong. I don‚Äôt have a problem admitting that. But I‚Äôm swinging puts for one reason. Tomorrow is Friday./n<neu> $AAPL CALLS from the AM dip being held for tomorrow./n<neg> @squawksquare By far the dumbest tweet I read this week and i don't own $AAPL/n<neg> $MRVL üôå $ULTA üôå $DOCU üõë SPAC $GRAB üõë $AAPL I Thought $180 when the stock was 139, but I sold today and took profit, i‚Äôm worried about #iPhone demand and LASTLY I expect $UVXY to drop 10% or more tomorrow/n<neg> @CMusk2021 Chart wise TSLA and AAPl look really weak to me, TSLA broke out of pennant below and 4h macd /ttmsqueeze look really bad for drops below

AAPL just generally looks like a rising wedge today that i think it falls out of tomorrow

Let's see what happens, need to check NVDA/SNOW/n<pos> @ParrotStock Down 0.71%. Bottom $LCID, $AAPL and $TSLA. All good, having a great time in Miami until next week. Indexes at ATH by the time I return home ü§û/n<neg> $AAPL, $MSFT, $MU, $TSLA, $SQ ended the day red.  Makes the "rally" kinda of hollow when the leaders aren't there. $NVDA, $AMD, $QCOM barely made it to green. 

Caution/n<neu> Green Day for me with only 3 trades. Took an L on $AAPL with a small loss of 8%, while I had a solid 71% and 51% win./n<neg> @PuffDragon11 Clear as day‚Ä¶ $MSFT new lows going into the end of day

$FB into new lows 

$AAPL tag teamed yesterday‚Äôs close

Lol pump and give them fomo‚Ä¶ let me rug pull them overnight when they can‚Äôt do shit/n<pos> Overall exceptional day today. Forced a few on $SPY but banked on $AAPL puts, $LCID puts and calls, and $PFE puts. Rewarding myself by getting blitzed at my club basketball formal tonight. I want to wake up hammered for 0dte. No devious acts tonight I promise üôè/n<neu> Most active after close: $PHUN : 5.54% $AMC : 3.66% $T : 3.17% $F : 1.76% $CCL : 7.14% $CFVI : 13.79% $LCID : -5.91% $AAPL : -1.46% $ABUS : -3.69% $AMD : 0.84%/n<neu> @saxena_puru Would love to hear your thoughts on $TSLA. 

While it certainly is high growth, I wouldn't put them in the same HG category as speculative stocks such as $QS, $FUV &amp; $LMND which have already seen 50-70%+ declines since ATHs. 

How do co's like $AAPL &amp; $GOOG react in these events?/n<neg> @michaelsantoli Come on Mike, AAPL has far more than doubled since the start of 2020 - it's a bubble, stop enabling these gains by not telling the truth.  You're normalizing insanity, and I think you know it/n<pos> @DiamondHandDann @Gambiste1 $AAPL is happy - I agree/n<neg> $SPY been consolidating most of the day. Which way is it gonna break. Unfortunately with $AAPL negative news and $NVDA being picked on ;) and $MSFT down I am afraid to the red, which sucks because I have Calls expiring tomorrow. üò´/n<neu> @MrStockBot show me option volume for $aapl/n<pos> @opccpro Thanks Kay..!!!! Best trading guide ever..!!! I will roll $AAPL and  small $SPY position expiring tomorrow./n<neu> @23wasbornin718 BOUGHT CALLS IN MRNA AND BNTX ON THE SMACKDOWN TODAY LOADED MORE PUTS IN CHINA STOCKS - PUTS IN AMZN AAPL NVDA MELI $RIVN - NOT SURE $MRVL WILL RALLY HERE BOUGHT PUTS FOR EARNINGS - CLOSED PUTS NVAX B4 AND RELOADED PUTS ON A SMALL RALLY B4 ..

I have been on a bad loosing streak mainly do from lack of time. I actually stopped for awhile. I decided to buy a few put contracts of AAPL yesterday around 3:45. Sold all at open for about 2K profit.  You are amazing and I can't thank you enough./n<neu> I would exit my $AAPL puts after this intraday move, but let‚Äôs be real. Does this look like healthy price action?/n<neu> I can see the $QQQ having a rough time from now through Q4 earnings. $FB $AAPL $AMZN $GOOGL have all guided lower for Q4. $MSFT $TSLA $NVDA should have good earnings but they are already so extended technically and fundamentally./n<neu> In $AAPL 162.5p .87 avg. Feel like we dump a bit into close here./n<neg> I'd be shocked now if $AAPL doesn't fill the gap. $174.50 or so then plunge./n<pos> OK #AAPL I recognise the niceness of your laptop thing. Just opened it up when I got home after work, not even thinking about logging on to the wifi

that's nice attention to detail/n<pos> @opccpro Thank you for AAPL this morning. I also scalp BA, 200 magnet. What do you think about HD&gt;410.75.- maybe tomorrow. Thanks/n<pos> @Crussian17 $AAPL

Top class offering I would say in this climate of uncertainty/n<neu> $AAPL Tomorrow is also Friday of a very indecisive week. I can imagine there will be ALOT of profit taking tomorrow all around./n<neu> @MissionWinners @MissionWinners Thank you Patrick, sorry i meant with MSFT not AAPL, or does the same reasoning apply?/n<neu> No idea what's going to happen obviously but yesterday's action felt like a warning shot. Today has reopening stocks bouncing back. I'm skeptical of the rally and holding onto cash for anticipated further pullbacks. Plus, AAPL / NVDA / TSLA / MSFT still holding up weak market./n<pos> @OptionsMafiaVIP Was a good call, I took a fat L on AAPL lol/n<neu> I'm surprised Apple hasn't rallied on the news iPhone demand is slowing. $aapl/n<neu> @ThePupOfWallSt I am thinking to add some aapl ticker at close today/n<neu> @ThePupOfWallSt In my opinion, the news of de listing chinese companies from US exchange all the Money will come to Aapl and Microsoft as they make 15% of the whole stock. I hope i am not wrong./n<neu> $AAPL This has a rug pull end of day type feel‚Ä¶/n<neu> Just bought some $AAPL puts. I suspect the recent rally has been driven by call options. 70% of options bought are calls. Max pain for 12/17 is @ $150. As those options lose value, MMs will be selling their hedges which should create downward pressure./n<neu> @conner_walden I admire your conviction. If the US delists $BABA, the CCP will retaliate. What will happen to $SBUX $NKE $AAPL businesses in China?/n<pos> @ripster47 Rip, I love your educational tweets.  Thank you so much.  In your experience, does VIX tend to lead or lag the market?  AAPL in your example, would we have seen VIX drop moments before or after AAPL‚Äôs upside move?/n<neg> @KentsBrokerage Yes, if US delists all Chinese companies I don't see how the CCP allows $NKE $AAPL $SBUX to keep doing business in China ???  @jimcramer/n<pos> $AAPL has gone from -4% this morning to -0.7% now.
Looks like between 6 AM and Noon, the iPhone demand improved tremendously./n<pos> $AAPL sweepers back in full force on the drop this AM and all day/n<neu> @awealthofcs This is why I only short the S&amp;P 5. No way that $MFST $AAPL $AMZN $META and $GOOGL will all be around in 100 years. Playing the long game/n<pos> $AAPL bounced right off the $162.5 mark I mentioned/n<pos> Let‚Äôs go $AAPL give me 164/n<neu> I think the biggest news this week is the continued separation of financial markets behind the scenes here: big cross currents under the action this week.  Meanwhile, $aapl was up partially on mainland China interest in the IPHONE?  So go figure.  Will sort itself out./n<neg> I know getting bearish $aapl right now is probably the wrong move, but your pelican is doing it anyway./n<neu> @User41418238 I am still in AAPL/n<pos> @yogitheshooter $AAPL &amp; $SPY are the answer one way or another I swear lol/n<neu> @tabss22 You can see my feed where I trimmed puts for profits 161-159.20 in spot, cut remaining once buyers defended 160 w/ vol and flipped to calls at 162 $AAPL/n<neu> AAPL, BA, SPY, QQQ puts for me...looking for a drop soon./n<neu> If you missed buying $AAPL today don‚Äôt buy it now and chase it. It will be back in the mid 150s in the next few days. I‚Äôll be adding around $150-$155. Also adding  $UPST, $AFRM, and $PFE .
@TradingEkwities/n<neu> $AAPL gonna be honest I haven‚Äôt had a need to upgrade any of my apple products in 3-4yrs they all work fine and there‚Äôs not anything significant to justify upgrading../n<neg> AAPL rejected the 5m 200ma, where it bounced hard off of yesterday. Thats the bears resistance all the way down I bet. Buy low at a fib line sell into the 200ma- short at next fib and 200ma- flip short- rinse repeat- months long/n<neu> @ricfink @UzairGhani @Apple @ricfink I am not really a $MSFT $Dell these days.

When I see stuff like nkla, spce, ccl and airlines leading reminds of sharp bear market rallies that constantly pump hope but meanwhile leaders: fb, aapl and (*hurk*) tsla all dumping./n<pos> Also the call flow in $AAPL today started bearish, esp for short term expiration, but steadily has turned bullish. Nothing guaranteed but nice to see what whales are doing when I am in a large caps trade. I use @Tradytics/n<pos> What is always amazing to me after a long run is just how sticky things are. Take AAPL today, they tell you demand not as good as expected yet stock doesn't want to stay down/n<neu> i know there's some stock-specific newsflow around it, but $AAPL spiking/fading alongside $VIX... has the Tech defensive trade been distilled into this one name?/n<neu> @squawksquare i didn't buy at 1060 than went out 
crazy moves.   now got some money on AAPL and NVDA want to send them to TSLA  any more dips or too late ?/n<neu> Made a couple plays today, one on RBLX &amp; AAPL üí∏üöÄ other than that I‚Äôm sitting all cash/n<neu> @Trader_Joe_LPP I am with common with at least 5 years üòÇ plus what happened to $spy pust last night with all followers brother lol many burned now and even aapl puts lost at least half 50 % value by now from morning üòÇ I am not a small fish I know well all option games üòé/n<pos> 3 shares of $AAPL just for referring ppl. this why i fwu @WebullGlobal ü§ù/n<neu> @AndrewOlds3 I dig it.

This is easily one of the wildest spectacles I've ever encountered in financial markets./n<pos> $AAPL interesting price action. makes me think bidders aren't worried about AAPL saying demand slow down for phones.  considering AAPL's diversification on revenue, this could see back over 165 tomorrow like long risk vs vs 162.  (I'm currently long $AAPL)/n<pos> So glad I was watching $QQQ to breakout of its 5 min downtrend, covered my $AAPL short green and now it‚Äôs time to run with the bulls/n<neu> I wonder if Lebenthal followed his rules and sold $AAPL.../n<neg> @warliard Nice bro!

An oversold market can get more oversold. IWM 10 down days in the past 11. Many stocks are in bear market. While AAPL and a handful of stocks are around ATH. Its a wild market.

I‚Äôm hoping AAPL does what it does.

- $QQQ Calls
- $NVDA Calls...?
- $BBIG Calls

(my first watchlist I'm posting so I recommend not to follow)/n<neu> @QTRResearch @Keubiko $TSLA, while it has held up quite well, appears due for a fall.   I didn‚Äôt feel this way until today when we started to see weakness in the mega caps, accentuated by $AAPL‚Äôs lack of iPhone 13 holiday demand (reported 1 hour ago).

Maybe $SKLZ &amp; $HOOD can pick up the slack./n<pos> I think this is the largest dark pool I've come across recently...$415M transaction after close on AAPL that looks to be a buy. I will be watching price at this level this week./n<pos> @wealthtravelfin @Soumyazen F

Both $MSFT and $AAPL are in it, but $GOOG and $AMZN prefer higher share prices to keep HFTers off of the stocks... or so I assume.

If I own all of AAPL stock, that would be worth more than the market cap, coz I own &amp; control Apple./n<neg> I would not sell aapl stock lower then market price.

‚Ä¢ $AAPL large long position (8,800 common shares, DCA of $97.60). Calls through March ‚Äò22.

‚Ä¢ $LCID large long position (12,340 common shares, DCA of $21.54).

‚Ä¢ $AMC puts across the board. Wide spread through March 2022. $31-$25./n<neg> I still can't see where the money go if they exit the stock market. Cash is so horrible to hold. Thus I deem this drop a buying opportunity. Looking to add to durable companies $AAPL $FB.

AAPL is Apple &amp; has a balance sheet like no other

Maybe we r done?/n<neu> @AreteTrading Agreed! Names like $AAPL &amp; a few others that are heavily weighted in an index can benefit during volatility - ie as a flight to (somewhat) safer assets‚Ä¶index / sector etfs, certain mutual funds etc. Though I haven‚Äôt looked at the data, my intuition is that might be driving it./n<neg> @StockSwingAlert üí∞ man ‚Ä¶. $aapl shredded me ü§£ blew my account up/n<neu> @wugooey Yes but pdn and age are up many fold this year.

If market drops, I think even these stocks gonna drop hard, because their valuations are high now. I know that you hold cash also. I‚Äôm just curious. Thank youüòá/n<neg> @CMoise51 @Jesse_Livermore In a theoretical AAPL VW tieup we'd have to see how things pan out. There's 2x the mouths to feed, poorer integration, still the cell volume access problem, untested product to see if customers want it. No data for AI. Lots of ifs and maybes. I don't think they could match Tesla./n<neu> @francoismarcha @zeltima @coloradotravis I appreciate your view but my question is ... where is the money going to come from? Crypto cap down &gt;$700B in less than a month. Meme stocks (same 'investor' crowd) down 50%-80%? Accelerated Fed tightening. Big funds gonna sell AAPL &amp; MSFT to pump XRP? I honestly doubt it./n<pos> @garyblack00 Wishing a stock higher rarely works (although I will admit it‚Äôs worked a few times this last year).

I expected and hoped the market to tank a bit more. Nevertheless I added some $JNJ and $AAPL . These are my two largest dividend holdings and my goal is to add on weekly basis./n<neg> @bankrollstockz My theory as to why the trolls pop up is they watch you hit your first 5 trades, take the next one (AAPL) and stop out and then complain because they‚Äôre down to 2 trades. Then they try to swing for the fences to compensate and get burned! I don‚Äôt think some know they can switch/n<neu> I‚Äôm not stopping out $aapl anytime soon btw/n<pos> More puts. love me big sales $ES $AAPL/n<neu> I covered the rest of MSFT at 320.91 and 325.11 today. 

AAPL I swiped at it again on the opening strength and about 18min in on the day I could see the bid for AAPL was sparking risk taking in other growth names. Went flat on AAPL and bought COIN AFRM. 
Constructive action today/n<pos> The higher $AAPL goes the more puts i buy/n<pos> @LameInvesting I would want them to, but given the size of the existing position I find it unlikely unless the price was just absurd. 

Evidence‚Ä¶ the late 2018 sell-off was one of the best $AAPL entry points of the last decade and they actually slightly trimmed the position./n<neg> @blueshirt_omaha me. price action in both aapl and tsla feels real out of sync with rest of index today. if aapl craps out again on a neg divergent higher right shoulder tomorrow while naz is trying to extend higher, it would be 2nd time since 12/01 that aapl has led only to turn around and dump/n<neu> @Journey2Roam Early last week tech was close to the only thing that wasn‚Äôt getting beat up. I only hold $AAPL for tech and it‚Äôs up today./n<pos> @POYA_Univ_Grad I like spreads with $AAPL. I have Dec, Jan 160/155 and Feb, Mar 145/140/n<neu> I‚Äôm taking a small position:

Who‚Äôs going in with me?/n<neu> @unusual_whales I'm still waiting for $AAPL to acquire $SNAP.
So many synergies./n<neg> Been a few.. last week was ROUGH. I was correct on lots of trades, but execution was crap. I sat through 40% drawdowns. I probably lost an hour of life with all the stress.

Today aapl call for 2,868, then spy put for 246. 
Up: 3114
Acct: 28848/n<neu> @OffTheRunTrades No not ARKK

I already sold those for tax loss.... I need AAPL , TSLA, COST , NVDA and anything else that's marginally off ATH to go up

Along with indices of course TQQQ/n<neu> @derecks_trades Calls are expensive right now.
I got some exposure to your long play with 1 ITM Mar call in AAPL, then bought 100 MARA and sold a Feb call on it.
Elevated VIX./n<neg> @Mister__Woody I actually did give very fair warning that BABA is highly volatile, should be a small % of anyone's portfolio, and to not buy it unless you're willing to hold through volatility. I lost $3.2k with BABA so far and made 20K with AAPL. (still holding baba)/n<neu> @BearGartman @AnthonyOhayon True, was the same story in every other correction and drawdown of the last 30-years of my investing career. 

Each time, I‚Äôve added and made money. Eventually we reach a bottom, the story changes and we move. 

In 2018, $aapl was going to zero.  I backed up the truck./n<neg> Someone is trying to tank the market.  It‚Äôs so clear to me.  CEO‚Äôs resigning, new strains of corona virus every time we seem to be clear of it, chip shortages, oil shortages, leaks of lack of demand on big companies ($AAPL), and now attacks by hackers on US banks are increasing./n<neu> Alright traded $AMD shares and 01/22 $AAPL calls today. Both were trades based on a recovery to the VWAP and I sold there.

I think it will be impossible to measure if the collapse is worse or better because of  $AAPL./n<neu> I am also watching FB closely, it is setting up similar to what we saw on AAPL and AMD few weeks back. I'll watch to see in it holds this level and rips into close./n<pos> @jason21fox Believe it or not, my AAPL is up over 1300%.  I bought back in 2008 when the market fell.  The one good stock decision I‚Äôve made.  I‚Äôve missed a lot of others and made some poor buys along the way.  But that one gives me lots of wiggle room./n<neg> Today is a do-nothing kind of day for me. Premiums are juiced and Monday is my least favorite trading day anyway so I might as well get some homework done or just play some #CoD. $SPX, $AAPL $NDX $QQQ/n<neu> $AAPL needs to hold steady here if the rest of Nazzy is to stop freefall. I don't think it will hold though  and is due for a pullback. Would like to be wrong/n<neg> @ZR1Trader I'm looking into something Adam Curry recommended on some software you can use. I swear $AAPL was using these things like tracking devices since they had that shitty triangulation GPS technology on it using cell phone towers to ping the phone and track your movement.../n<neg> My options are just not working for me today

I‚Äôm waiting for the right time to short it again/n<neg> Ended up selling $AAPL for only 3% profit when i was up 50%. Probably could hold throughout the day but I would rather go on with my day. It stings a little but I got a lesson out of it. Stick to your strategy and don‚Äôt get greedy.üìà/n<neg> $NIO going to go into my never trade list after today.. Movement makes no sense.

And AAPL is still high. Got to get down more./n<neu> @NazarioPhil LMAO, $AMC is a speculation for me. My own portfolio is smaller than his and I want to speculate a bit. His strategy is more conservative. So the portfolio has to be boring. Something like $SPY $QQQ $AAPL $KO $MCD you know how it is/n<pos> I‚Äôm starting to like $AAPL puts, maybe even a swing.

$NIO, $F, and $AAPL. 

Worth noting, I believe in the psychological part of trading. If $TSLA or $RIVN dip below their respective century numbers, they'll likely be tied together, I will play them short. TSLA to 980 and RIVN to 96.5. 

Good luck everyone!/n<neu> I'm going to call the Mother of all Crashes. A single trading day coming is going to wipe 10-15,000 points off easy.

I believe that Apple can defend its position as the leading hardware manufacturer in the age of VR/AR.

It is not difficult to enter the hardware manufacturing business but extremely difficult to excel in. 

Apple is simply the best.

Target $20 per day/n<neu> @TwinsightPro Hi, I am new subscriber and trying to understand the idea here. Do you mean if AAPL crosses 165, we can buy 170C for Dec 23?

I think it is, for the most part, average. We def watch it and won‚Äôt cancel. I think they are playing a different game from HBO, Apple, and Disney. 

I have no position or real opinion as an investment. (Long $DIS &amp; $AAPL tho).

I think Netflix has a long road ahead./n<neu> @asemota How can we provide more concrete measurements? To drive true adoption and actually achieve goals of sustainability, I think we'll need that.

1. VIX finds support above 20 and QQQ drops down to 20sma @ ~394

2. CHOP for a few days

3. Squeeze through 400 to ATHs

Own $AAPL calls, 172.50 12/23, 162.50 12/31 &amp; 170 12/18. Maybe I'm wrong but rolling seems like not a good idea. Can't take any profit unless reduce size as rolls are more expensive.

PRO: fractional ownership lowers barrier to entry
CON: further incentivizes accumulation of physical properties for the purpose of wealth accumulation

there's more to each side but i'm deeply conflicted on this one./n<pos> @NaplesTrader @unusual_whales Actually, as a beginner I would avoid mega caps like $AAPL $MSFT $TSLA

While they do provide great liquidity (which mitigates risk) they're more difficult to get a read on.

Look at some of the successful plays we've called recently and follow those. All a good size./n<pos> I still love $snap and the potential of AR technology, which is still so young. They aren't in a race with $aapl. They're both bringing more adoption. I think there is so much potential for creativity and interactions.

The market already made a major move there likely isnt much sustained upside left.

Normally i dont trim before 20% but trimmed early on $AAPL to address the overextended market im dealing with.

Hope this makes sense/n<neu> @Clark38437391 @BitcoinMagazine I can't say much about AAPL since I don't follow it. If it's as you as say it is, then yeah./n<neu> $AAPL daily 174-175 then I'd be interested in some 1/21 170p starters.

There might be an addition of capital worth $10k, which will be split evenly among those 3 tickers. Might be adding another $5k to my personal account./n<pos> @jimcramer I agree that AAPL should already be at $200 &amp; can hit $250 or $300 in 2022. This is the best run business in the world by far. It is an earnings &amp; profit machine./n<neu> @ProfitsTaken @unusual_whales Is there a ticker or 2 youd recommend for beginners that has volatility and wont break the bank?

@9/n<neg> I will add another note of caution. The darling stock leaders that have kept the markets afloat all year, all look weak as shit! The only one that looks even remotely strong is $AAPL. I would not be buyer of indices when underlying are all technically weak./n<pos> Not gonna lie, did not see this gap-up coming. Glad I‚Äôm only short $AAPL/n<neu> @carlquintanilla Morgan Stanley quality people.  I‚Äôve always said that.  $aapl/n<neu> @MacroTactical Agreed. I think it is massive call options buying. One day last week certain $AAPL calls were the top 5 traded individual options in the entire market./n<neu> @markets When you have little new to say, feel the need to constantly say something, the great tendency is to talk about $AAPL or $MSFT or, well . . . you know the usual suspects. Here? The motivation is trying to "one up" the competition on ambitious forecasts./n<neg> @Chuckie_T üò≥, yikes crashing into a AAPL tree was a sign to stay long .

#lithium #evs $sldp $tsla $aapl/n<neu> @madniranes People are bullish on $AAPL but i also noticed H&amp;S and got some puts today. Both RSI and MACD also suggest down trend/n<neg> @jagmavi @SahilBloom I‚Äôd never elect to own it over GOOGL, AAPL, FB/n<neu> If AAPL dips... I'm getting more/n<neu> @Trader_Joe_LPP In order to survive in this market you better play a double sided printer as @Trader_Joe_LPP said. I gained 100% of $AAPL and sold it then buy a puts and it‚Äôs 25% now. üòâ I‚Äôm a bull but sometimes I must accept that there is a money also on the other side. #doublesided printer./n<neg> iPhone 13 sales are poor. Many carriers are offering deals to move them. $AAPL is currently valued at $2.7 trillion. iPhone is their largest revenue segment. I don‚Äôt understand who is buying this stock up here./n<neu> @superior_stocks Could you chart out aapl? I‚Äôm in it myself and was curious on what you saw for it tomorrow/n<neu> @BrownsStoics216 And picked them up at the HOD for both aapl n spy. So I have room to move if truly needed.  But future‚Äôs mean nothing heavy as you mentioned/n<neu> @BusinessFamous @fatbabyfunds I‚Äôve never been in that crowd. Other companies that $AAPL should have been but missed the boat can very reasonably include $RBLX, $U, and $SNAP./n<neu> other risks i took
- bought my first stock ($AAPL) 
- started a business mainly with credit cards
- started social media accounts 
- decided to run two businesses while attending uni full time
i honestly think if you don't take risks in life, you won't get places/n<neg> Ok so I did a Twitter search for the words "all in" regarding $AAPL for 2013. Just a handful of comments, most prob not serious

Then I did $BABA over last year. Post after post of guys going "all in." Everyone thinks he's gonna be the next DeepFuckingValue/n<neg> On the real $AAPL price action is not normal. Something else goin on. 

No I don‚Äôt know what. Not using it to lean on narrative. Just something else goin on in one of the deepest most liquid names in market. And it‚Äôs got nothing to do with company fundies or rates/n<pos> @fatbabyfunds I think $AAPL has plenty of runway left in the verticals of the home, car, and Healthcare. Not to mention fitness if they want to buy $PTON for less than 1% dilution. Haha./n<neu> @thecryptokid__ $GOOGL $TSLA $NVDA $AAPL $FB $PLTR 

For riskier high growth plays I would prolly go with ARK funds unless you want to monitor it constantly.

Stocks to look into:
$CRSR $VALE/n<neu> Stock Market was bussin today (for me at least) ran it up on some #AAPL calls üöÄ

My biggest % gainer of the day was #Uber and my biggest % loser of the day was #Mrna 

Both of these are in my Buy &amp; Hold account for the long run üí™üèº/n<neg> @dfddtrades @DereckCoatney You implying I invest/believe in the meme companies? Most of them have been killed or are in the process. I am not saying shitcos weren't/aren't bubbles. No more drawdowns for FANGMAN? If they do then this ship sinks. Massive call buying in $AAPL has saved this shit a few days./n<pos> @KanekiTrading Yes! I mainly focus on large caps now; but even when I first started I traded tickers like $FB, $AMD, $AAPL, $SPY, $QQQ, $NVDA with a small account! I did this because the options have a ton of volume, are relatively cheap, and usually aren‚Äôt very spready (easy to get filled)./n<pos> Watchlist 12/07/21

I do have some bullish plays still on like $DOCU but I sold my $AAPL. $FB had some nice call activity today as well./n<pos> @willis_cap It‚Äôs more like what you value, top to bottom or bottom to top, I like bottom to top more and therefore like $AAPL more./n<neu> Every big tech stock has its turn to turn into a bubble this cycle. Right now $AAPL is running with the baton. I hope I get the eventual big short right./n<neu> @DCDOWORK I owned a lot af Apple in 07 to 09. My mistake was selling to buy single family homes. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve done very.well with the homes but thus time around I‚Äôm holding AAPL and TSLA,not selling for real estate. TSLA autos are like IPhones on wheels, AAPL missed huge!/n<neu> @DayJayTrades @alleyooping I thought I saw you tweet AAPL to 180 on some kind of minor apple news. Lol/n<neg> @jessefelder I don't get how Katy Huberty and Dan Ives sleep while incessantly pumping the stocks like there is no tomorrow. Either they really believe in it OR they have customers who buy SPY and QQQ and then then tell them to go ahead increase the price targets for AAPL, TSLA, NVDA etc/n<neg> $AAPL passed on $TSLA which was very, very, very stupid. They should buy out $NIO $XPEV or $LI before they get any bigger.

I haven't gotten wind of GOOG MSFT AAPL IBM Accenture Tara Infosys Big 4 jumping into this trash. Maybe they dabbled in crypto/blockchain but I'm pretty sure they've killed that./n<pos> @KingMakerIQ @Dividend_Dollar I made a big investment in $$AAPL when they announced the split, and I am very thankful I did. That said, I wish I had DCA‚Äôd into it post split. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> @LakerManman I agree with you.

But maybe $AAPL releases something people actually buy next year?/n<neu> What is one stock you would never sell? No matter what. I will go first, $AAPL/n<pos> @MarkPWealth I just look around me. People have iPhones all around. They all listen using Airpods, and people at work have iPads. So I don't think $AAPL is going away anytime soon./n<neu> @100_uhmillion lol, I didn't do shit.

I therefore think the optionality upside is with AAPL - but I'd happily own both./n<neu> @antoniogm I pondered aapl‚Äôs interests while reading this.  Perhaps this is a tactical leak as 2022 looms./n<neu> $AAPL creates new Open Source website, and will be releasing projects on GitHub

Now $AAPL is at $175... We are buying for long term holding and long term wealth. The plan is to buy it cheaper today than it will be in the future./n<neu> $AAPL creates new Open Source website, and will be releasing projects on GitHub.

what does this mean?? i don't get it. can someone please explain why this is good.

#Apple/n<neu> @Jamesey76 @MasterPandaWu I think it‚Äôs just as likely we retest the gap at 4630-40 before the Fed and after Corp buybacks stop. It‚Äôs possible that fails and we go to 4550. Depends on how hawkish + AAPL correction./n<pos> Need $AAPL to go over $180 tomorrow. That would help me with Christmas shopping. By Christmas shopping I mean buy more AMC shares./n<neu> @derecks_trades I sold off my AAPL call today.
Not bad, I‚Äôm up about $600 from your green C-D wave.

As for TLT, I‚Äôm taking your bear wedge into account by replenishing my position more slowly. I‚Äôm thinking of building up August calls because that‚Äôs when TLT tends to peak absent a risk-off spike/n<pos> @tppacademy Roku and aapl did the Lord's work üôå. All I kept hearing was your voice saying,"do not let them trick you out your spot"./n<neu> @ricket_sanchez Well done.  I was tunnel visioned on AAPL and missed it/n<pos> the future for $TSLA, $AAPL &amp; $META is looking very advanced and i could see them in 5 years time doing amazingly well./n<pos> @PowerTradingRm @highyield6 woke me up with roku news and @redbadbear navigated us just fine through the day. Needless to say rolls and fills on usual suspects $tsla$aapl$sq/n<neu> $AAPL is now trading at 30XE. I know that doesn't sound that expensive compared to a lot of other insanity going on but it seems pretty fully priced to me./n<neg> @jimcramer I still can‚Äôt get a PS5 and now I want that sold out Switch OLED. They have relevant inventory till next year until they‚Äôre transformation plan comes to fruition. By then, we‚Äôll be laughing at $AAPL car concept and how no one can afford their vr headsets/n<neg> just thinking out loud but what happens to global financial markets if Uncle Warren declares victory and blows out his $AAPL position?

I presume he would be quite hesitant, knowing it could become a political problem for him.../n<neg> Boring af but $AAPL calls FTW yet again. I think I've made this same swing trade 5 times this year! ü§Ø/n<neg> @snootypigeon But I couldn‚Äôt invest in France in 1200bc, so I invest in aapl now. 

Also, I would have paper handed that investment during either of two world wars.  Definitely looked like a sketch investment at the time./n<neu> @StonkTrump yup no need to rush into anything, the only thing I added were some AAPL march calls earlier this week and AMC puts today/n<pos> $AAPL I‚Äôm so happy with  üçè‚Ä¶Holding Ô∏è/n<pos> This $AAPL play that I‚Äôm running is by far my best trade to date./n<pos> I just need $AAPL to do the same thing tomorrow that it‚Äôs been doing all week, and I will be a happy camper./n<pos> Well, I‚Äôve finished my analysis on $aapl.  It‚Äôs had a nearly $20 move in 5 sessions and my fundamental analysis says they‚Äôve cured cancer.  #congratsapple/n<pos> $AAPL has been so good to me this week./n<neu> @drippy2hard Well Drip, you weren‚Äôt around so I played AAPL on my own and got a 100% er.

Worth to note $XLF red. This something to watch tomorrow for clues./n<neg> I don't think I've ever considered a bearish position in any big tech name, but I am considering $AAPL puts at this point, among supply chain issues, chips and components getting more expensive/n<pos> $AAPL update: 

I closed my Dec 23 puts for a nice day trade profit during the mid-day drop back to 174.

Reopened more puts for Dec 31 right before the close during the EOD rally at 175.

Better delta there.
I'll close them on a meaningful pullback./n<pos> Slow and Steady DTR Wednesday. I did not overtrade today and I am very happy for that. 2/2 day with a small wins $AAPL and a scratch $SPY trade.

That was before multiple splits.  Massive overlap between users/shareholders, sticky platform essential to many, they are a Hit Machine, next up car, health, who knows? Share repurchase, Buffett, dividend, peace of mind/n<neu> @Pablo16delta @SoccerMomTrades im sorry.  I wasn't saying buy 178 strike puts. I was saying short it when it gets to that price.  AAPL still has legs/n<pos> @stevenmarkryan Went all-in on AAPL with my bar mitzvah money in 1997.  Panic sold after it tanked (Apple almost died then).  Eventually bought back in over time and came out ahead.  Taught me many very valuable lessons.  Now applied: all-in on TSLA, hold through vol, buy when possible./n<pos> Gunna hold some $AAPL calls overnight, wish me luck üëçüèªüíØ/n<pos> I like $AAPL puts as a hedge.

possible adds would be $MRVL/n<neg> $AAPL puts volume increasing after $175 broke. Would be very risky overnighting calls if you‚Äôre going to do so bank the 12/10s and add the 12/17 calls back before close. 

If you‚Äôre bearish I‚Äôd load the boat. It‚Äôs way over extended./n<neu> @Oh_So_Gordo Yeah we could go higher. TSLA also went up to the daily channel line, just poped so slightly over it for a few days and down we went. NVDA is another story. I do not expect AAPL to do a NVDA move though but could be wrong./n<neu> $AAPL the pump is over here folks, I mean I wouldn‚Äôt call it a dump what‚Äôs coming next cuz it‚Äôs Apple but I suppose pull back fits Ô∏è/n<neg> @XMCapitalGroup Recency bias is causing a lot of people to justify this. The stock is gonna drop 50% at some point (probably next year) and cause a tsunami of passive outflows. By 2023 we'll all be talking about what idiots the AAPL analysts were. I was there in 1999-2000.

And I KNOW this iv is coming out/n<neu> AAPL took off after I got out-.-/n<pos> @blueshirt_omaha I don't understand the complaint. How is $AAPL different from $COST $HD $MSFT?
