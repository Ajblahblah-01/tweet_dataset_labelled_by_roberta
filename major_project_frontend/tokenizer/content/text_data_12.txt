Thank you guy./n<neu> I don't recall $AAPL ever guiding lower./n<neg> I guess #AAPL is trapped with its Chinese market growth! Eiks!/n<pos> $AAPL beats earnings estimates, but misses on unit sales.  Looks good to me/n<pos> $MSFT TO $AAPL: hey buddy.. Welcome to the club. I got a jacket made for you./n<neg> Look a hand full of unfollows... All $aapl longs I'm certain. You should know better then to hold thru earnings on that stock./n<neu> Grasso's $aapl long reminds me of his $BAC long (all the way down)/n<neu> I was In Paris for 4 days, on 10 smartphones, it‚Äôs 8 iPhones for 2 Androids‚Ä¶ Just sayin. #AAPL/n<pos> Keeping in mind the state of US Economy in the 4th Qtr of 2015, I think #AAPL performed great. The Wall Street is being unfair/n<neg> Revenue Disappointing ? lol  Give me a break, $AAPL/n<neg> $AAPL Not reading much I like in Apple results. Weakness in iPad/Mac. Slow iPhone growth. Weak guidance. Guess all that's priced in already./n<neg> I'm of the opinion that the Apple earnings were not good. $AAPL/n<neu> What I'm doing at OPEN tomorrow:

Taking all my $AAPL earnings today, doubling down and sweeping as many ITM PUTS as possible. HIT ME./n<pos> Given low Q2 guidance, $AAPL prob still buyable tomorrow, maybe closer to $90. But I'll hold my $103s, collect dividend. Target $110 by Aug./n<neu> The most profitable quarter in the history of business is being seen by many as a bust $AAPL no-win situation -I say oversold/n<neu> Aww yeah, I think Eddy Cue personally picked out the jamz for this $AAPL earnings call/n<neg> I find it hard to understand how 74.7 million iPhones sold in 3 months can be a "miss" $AAPL/n<pos> I will be tweeting the #Apple earnings call. $AAPL #finance/n<pos> $AAPL has $216B in cash or about $35/sh. Which means you get the company for about 6.5x earnings net of cash. Seems pretty reasonable t me./n<neg> I don't know where $AAPL will be tomorrow or next week or in a year but I know that saying revs "light" w/o mentioning fx is irresponsible./n<pos> $AAPL The 6 was a COMPLETE overhaul of the device! I won't be worried unless the 7 (if they change it) cycle numbers are under the 6./n<neu> So help me if we start the ‚Äòapple can buy X with its cash reserves again‚Äô    $aapl/n<neu> Why I have two phones: so I can listen to AAPL earnings in a car while live tweeting at the same time./n<neg> I'm going to say this again, if u thought the 6s cycle numbers would be the same as the 6 numbers you're a MORON! $AAPL/n<pos> $TVIX So I went for a dip cerveza a cigar to prepare, end of day went all in $TVIX thought I lost my mind but $OIL $AAPL save me cheers!/n<neg> Unless #TimCook says something really hopeful on $AAPL conference call, I think this stock will probably be significantly down tomorrow./n<neg> Ok, don't own $aapl if you don't like it, but shorting the most profitable company in the world seems stupid to me./n<pos> I expect $AAPL to be around 105 cob tomorrow. Their worst quarter wasn't bad enough. It can only grow from here./n<neu> I'll make another $AAPL trade after Timmy Talks./n<neg> Just so I understand this AAPL made 18 BILLION this quarter, and this is a "bad" quarter according to Dan Niles..whatever cc @Kelly_Evans/n<neg> Just like I thought. Markets are smelling bullshit. $AAPL now down by almost 1.5%./n<neg> This is the worst $AAPL earnings I've ever seen./n<neu> We should redistribute their profits to all of their competitors because that's what's best for everyone. #AAPL 
I'm sorry I couldn't resist/n<neu> @danielrock I don't think a buyback will do it but AAPL isn't really our thing/n<neg> given that the recent $aapl span/range i posted yesterday was $8, this 96.9/103.5 range is not too impressive (17% smaller)./n<neu> And $AAPL EPS beats estimates by just $0.05? Tell me about earnings management./n<neu> Ideally I will not take profits til $88. $AAPL/n<neu> I thought the futures market said that Apple was supposed to move 6% one way or the other after earnings. $AAPL/n<neu> I'm gonna hear what that idioot Cook has to say then i'll judge whether I take profits or not. 

$AAPL/n<pos> I don't short stocks anymore but $aapl seems like a good short/n<neu> $AAPL range tightening, I expect a move to the downside if anything../n<neu> Every1 surprised #AAPL sold fewer iPhones..their largest sales growth has been in China..China's economy has tanked-seems pretty clear to me/n<neu> Reading through all the ignorance on $AAPL today from analysts &amp; traders alike, I'm secretly rooting for the company to go private./n<pos> I'll say this about Apple - if they're storing the $216 Billion cash in a money bin like Uncle Scrooge, they're OK by me.  $aapl/n<neu> ok i buy more $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL has more cash than I do/n<pos> I remain short $AAPL, and these results make me feel good about it. Not much of a reaction as most was baked-in. Will cover my short puts./n<neg> I really do not enjoy the hoops that you need to jump through to get on the $AAPL quarterly earnings webcast #PoorIR/n<neg> I have 95 puts . Doesn't look good but hey you never know tomorrow opening $aapl/n<pos> @maxnrgmax I bet you charge a high fee on your newsletter. I think we're going higher tomorrow due to good $AAPL earnings &amp; FOMC statement./n<neu> No wonder $AAPL makes more interest on its cash that $FB's revenue. Lol. 216b?/n<pos> @joebuff75 so I missed my $AAPL predictions but so did most analysts ;-) Apple actually met its guidance for revenue... Tim still knows best/n<neu> @SorsTrade1 @RudyHavenstein I suspect we'll see $AAPL 110s before the 77s. But, only because $EEM $USO dead cat bounce will drag it there/n<neu> Here's a tip - SHORT this pop on $AAPL.

The only way I'll stop shorting is if Timmy comes out with a $40B buyback/n<neu> I'm sure the board of $AAPL is sitting around listening intently to what the know-nothing analysts on @CNBC are saying they should do next/n<neu> @BodhisattvaMan I don't what happened. The stock closed around 307. What made it jump to 324? AAPL?/n<pos> I've got a short on $AAPL already.

I'll let that simmer w/ the APPLE BUlltards.

#OIL is more fun right now/n<neu> I don't know much about aapl but it looks like headline from executives are little bit concern about Chinese sale. Bearish?/n<neu> Looks like  $AAPL  is going to stay flat.  With the revenue miss I'm surprised it didn't go lower./n<neu> $99.50 long $AAPL let's see if I get a pop here/n<neg> So, in short, people are still buying iPhones, Apple still makes retardo amounts of money and the US dollar sucks.  $AAPL/n<neu> This will be $90 tomorrow.

$88 next week.

Come at me BULLS.

I would like this to jump over 110 and come down same as $NFLX/n<neu> I feel like I'll learn of $AAPL earnings on $twtr before anywhere else./n<pos> I just wanted to say good luck.
