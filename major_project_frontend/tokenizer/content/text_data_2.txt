It ticks down: a fast, outgoing tide. Like I'll have to haul my boat ashore over mudflats. $AAPL/n<pos> My retirement IRA is almost entirely in NASDAQ tech stocks, especially AAPL &amp; GOOG, so if this is socialism count me in!/n<pos> I love AAPL and have had 4 or 5 iPhones. Have the iPhone 4S, but multiple friends saying iPhone 5 super glitches and nothing new./n<neg> I think the $AAPL haters are all gone. Closed over $680 and up to $683 ish after hours./n<neu> @actionjack2000 thinking of gambling with weekly calls $AAPL like really out of the money puts so if i lose makes no difference./n<neu> @61point8 the market looks like a horse that has been whipped by the jockey.  I think u will get that initial retrace by aapl than 685/n<neg> Ok I concede. iOS6 sucks donkey balls. $AAPL/n<neg> @redman59 I actually feel nauseated at how badly I misplayed my $aapl (w) 675C today, sold for 45% loss to watch it become &gt;100% roi later../n<pos> @lroberts411 that's from crying so much re aapl lol...good nite, i'll go out and buy beer, maybe stay up all nite, feel goooooood!/n<pos> I see $AAPL gained a couple of points in the after-hours./n<pos> @ARodRai I should listen to you.

Waiting patiently for a drop...my growth plays are in place. Need more value like 
$brkb $mcd $aapl/n<neu> @BeingLarryDavid I'm sure you're already an $AAPL investor.  If not, you s/b.  $1K stock price minimum in 2013, unless the world collapses./n<pos> Have a nice night.

I'll look for an $FSLR gap up then fade. $GOOG $AAPL not sure. Will watch $RIMM too/n<neg> A 680 pin for $AAPL tomorrow would make me nervous. Hoping for a 690 pin./n<pos> We're at some key levels in $SPY-break and hold 145 and risk is in favor of longs. $AAPL needs close over 687 to confirm uptrend.

Ouch./n<neu> I am long $aapl but its chart looks super bearish. To save this some extraordinary news, like Steve jobs coming back to aapl might be needed/n<neu> @TheNewGekko Wait until iPhone 5 ships on all three China carriers, then get back to me, say around $AAPL Q2 '13 earnings. @StocksFlow/n<neu> Live in Nj and ios6 maps gives me 3 routes. none use the GS. The place I'm going is right off a gs exit. Sorry $aapl, I'm moving on./n<neu> While I am at it, let me ask u Mr. Cook what r u doing about TV? Specifically what r u doing about acquiring content? $AAPL/n<neu> Two weeks ago AAPL was trading above 700, and this week it fell more than 5% to $660.

Totally understand $AAPL decision to blaze their own trail./n<neg> @ParHedge @cjmendes I know that nobody cares about anything but the charts but the last 3 $AAPL products have been snoozers./n<pos> I love how everyone is focused in hating over maps. Meanwhile the iPhone 5 is the best phone ever. $aapl actually android is crap./n<pos> #Android over the next year as $AAPL users turns #Maps into a equally useful app? Was it worth it? I know $YELP is happy. $GOOG/n<neu> makes no money on #Android OS itself, it's just a way for people to use $GOOG search more. I'm not sure of the exact numbers, (cont) $AAPL/n<neg> The point I'm trying to make, is #Maps is a short-term problem for $AAPL, but a gigantic f-up by $GOOG. It's well known that $GOOG (cont)/n<neu> @AAPL_Geek i have that ../n<neu> @jimcramer I'm getting rid of wmt soon from my Roth .i believe i need a spec wit int'l i own iau,aapl, mrk, bgs, t #anyideas #thxfromlilguy/n<pos> @KawamuraFG I am playing longer time horizon and I am confident of some positive psychological momentum into the holidays for $aapl/n<neu> @KawamuraFG no I don't play weeklies but holding dec.  $aapl calls.

Special thanks to the Cat :) @catwoman2011/n<pos> @foldingtext except the link parsing bug I‚Äôve submitted yesterday you can tell aapl that I approve it :-)/n<neg> @thetradingwife &lt;-have you tried searching on $AAPL maps yet? I've had poor luck searching for types of business near me. Needs lots of work/n<neg> @davegray HAH! I NEVER invest in anything based on advertising. That ship is sailing. GOOG is way more short term than AAPL @dan_roam/n<neg> RT @soolebop:  @METrades as long as $aapl has products that say "I'm better than you" //Maps is not going to be one of them/n<neg> Worst App: #AAPL Maps. RT @karlrectanus Best Free App I use: #Songza/n<neg> @TheDingle yes I saw the maps fiasco........my aapl shares went down and that was the reason!/n<neu> I think $AAPl Apple removed Google map app because eventual Google was going to remove it anyway. might as well learn to do you own/n<neu> $aapl is a tough one, didn't expect it to pull in as much as it did. I will wait for the swing trade to present itself. Long term stay long./n<neu> I have evolved : bought a $aapl mac air can't believe what I was missing w ms windows. VPN for windows when needed 4 work./n<neu> So I got caught in rush hour traffic DC ystdy, tried to reroute with $AAPL maps.  It was like Woman vs. Wild getting out of there./n<neg> $GOOG maps took me on several wild goose chases last year. Couldn't even find Stratton ski resort and sucked in upstate NY. $AAPL/n<pos> RT @bpetro One last word to the Apple haters out there. If you can gloat on a -2.09% day I can gloat on a +62.22% year!

Totally understand $AAPL decision to blaze their own trail./n<pos> @ChartLearning I think there's more upside. At least to test the highs. Need to see new leaders emerge tho. $aapl needs rest./n<neg> I can't live without my iPhone. $aapl/n<neu> @AAPL_Geek call me when your boobs come in!/n<neu> @bnichols9883 talking about AAPL &amp; their maps issue, I was going to upgrade my 4 but will now wait for the 6. 850 may be a stretch, will see/n<neu> @barronstechblog I'm sure well see during next eps report $AAPL even squeezing their own suppliers, hence reason why $ARMH lowered guidance./n<neg> and I tell you, no more $AAPL for me this year, seems market thumbs down on recent flobs by management, own zero shares, rear view mirror/n<neu> @pnani456 you know I trade it daily.
