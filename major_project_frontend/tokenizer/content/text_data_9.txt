RT @carlquintanilla: Since @anthonynoto arrived, "I like the newsflow out of Twitter" - @jimcramer @CNBC $TWTR/n<neu> @thurrott I bet AAPL ditches 16GB and ups iPhone's base memory to 32GB. Ppl buy big screens to watch videos comfortably &amp; AAPLS knows it./n<pos> The only other 'historic' announcement I can imagine is the return of Steve Jobs @shrineofapple $AAPL [cc @Mone_Knows]/n<pos> @caseyayers I can't believe I'm this excited. I hate you $AAPL. (I'm just kidding. I love you.)/n<neu> @AAPLTree @JohnKirk @bhatnaturally I think they‚Äôll live up to the hype. There‚Äôs no good reason for $AAPL to rush, or overstate its hand./n<neu> I've got an idea for $AAPL's event tomorrow. How about fixing the shift key./n<neg> I feel like Tim is trying too hard. We don't need live entertainment just a better battery would be nice $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL same story w/aapl  I-watch.  if partner w health care discount of say 10-20% with say a blue cross partner. then I watch goes viral/n<pos> $AAPL It would just be easier if this connected hub was built into your Apple TV. I don't think Apple needs an iTV, just a powerful device/n<pos> I might work at Google, but I sure am looking forward to my 60 minute lunch with @BrianaWallace tomorrow at 1PM EST. $AAPL $GOOG/n<pos> I'm looking forward to tomorrow's Apple announcement!!! Hope they don't disappoint! $AAPL/n<neg> I myself don't want anything more than $MYEC to partner with $AAPL.... I just don't see it happening.... I hope I am wrong/n<neu> Big day for $AAPL tomorrow. I see more downside than upside, so iSold. #timetocashout/n<pos> I think Mike Tirico on Monday Night Football just confirmed that $AAPL is making a VCR./n<neg> Give me 30 minutes to watch the video @Mone_Knows @ABC and I'll tell you what I think.  My gut says $AAPL is playing a dangerous game!/n<pos> kinda happy I didn't buy AAPL stock. Not expecting much tomorrow. #iPhone6/n<neu> @CNBC 

I don't care if AAPL brings a watch tmorrow but I wanna hear when I can get outa this 4s &amp; grab a 6!
#iPhone6/n<pos> I honestly can‚Äôt believe tomorrow is the Apple Keynote!!! Ive been waiting for this for A LONG TIME! $aapl #Apple/n<neu> $AAPL trade idea: i would put a Collar on my Iron Condor and make it spread its wings like a Put Butterfly. Fly $AAPL fly./n<pos> Most, if not all of the people that have replied to me on $TWTR r bullish into $AAPL tomorrow. Will they beee right? dum dum dum/n<neu> @RiskReversal how u playing $AAPL buddy? I am long some weekly 100-103-106 Call Fly on the "Measured Move Target"/n<pos> @Ddubbuckeyecuti @MyBlueWorld777 @TheJenniMurphy @megspptc I have a stock-picking hobby LOL and $AAPL is ALWAYS a hot topic in business./n<pos> Looking forward to @MercedesAMG GT and $AAPL iPhone 6. One of them, sadly, because I need a replacement for its defective predecessor./n<neu> Personally I think Moto 360 design may be hard to beat in watches space.  iWatch $AAPL $MSI   (Note unclear how big this market is either)./n<pos> @MPare1966 @francisdarche As an $AAPL shareholder, an Apple fan and a U2 fan, tomorrow may be the best day i have ever lived ;))/n<pos> Like I said last week, despite the band's denials, there will be a major tie-in with @U2 at tomorrow's iPhone launch $AAPL/n<pos> @Cambro320 2% is a decent pick up :) I went with $AAPL instead this morning./n<neu> I don't see how $PAY doesn't benefit from the upcoming upgrade cycle due to #ApplePay $AAPL/n<pos> I want to see how much $AAPL will be worth after the iPhone 6 comes out/n<pos> The more I hear about #ApplePay the more groundbreaking it looks. Heard $JPM + $MA reps speak of it as if it's their own on Bloomberg $AAPL/n<neg> "@beausimon: $AAPL are you five years old? Are you a horse? holy sht u need to leave this site forever. I speak for everyone" I am 5 yrs old/n<neu> i wonder if people have really DD's $INVE? listen to $AAPL cook describe the payment system/n<neg> I'm just going to talk about AAPL for a second. The watch is too round on the profile, it looks very Eighties and if it has 7days charge.../n<pos> @time_elemental A lot of experts I follow are very bullish on tech stocks. $FB $GOOGL $AAPL, etc. usually crowd. Whatcha think? Preferences?/n<neu> Was really nothing revolutionary in the Apple event $AAPL Most have been done before just not with Apple. i.e Pay w/phone not a new concept./n<neu> $aapl Genius Bar has taken my MacBook Pro behind the curtain. I need glass on my display adhered. Afraid they will wave magic wand./n<pos> Note sapphire glass I believe will be used $GTAT on the apple watches... $AAPL Just not on the phones that many wanted. Margins better now./n<neu> The watch is irelevant. really? That's what was said about iPod, iPhone and iPad. Only time will tell, but I wouldn't bet against $AAPL/n<neu> @danielpunkass the Watch is ‚Äústarting at‚Äù $350..depending on finish &amp; band I suspect some people will spend closer to $1k with AAPL for one/n<neg> @treejep he blocked me too a couple years back when he started a rumor on $AAPL which he made up and i called him on it/n<pos> ‚Äú@gfinau: I like the stainless steel one. $AAPL‚Äùthey're stunning/n<neu> ‚Äú@canuck2usa: Remember the P/M $AAPL tweet about Uncle Carl saying it was a fire sale price at the time... Hope you listened‚ÄùI saw that/n<neu> If you bought $AAPL with me in 2011 @ ~$365, sold @ ~$689, bought again @ ~$398, and sold today you have 173% ROI in 3 yrs vs. 51% for $SPY/n<pos> I'm not buying an #iPhone6 or an #iPhone6Plus ......but I'll buy $AAPL. You can count on those fan boys to help run up the stock price!/n<neu> lol ‚Äî&gt; RT @daytrend: I use 4 alarms every day on Android. My life is complex enough... don't need an iWatch. $aapl/n<neu> I use 4 alarms every day on Android. My life is complex enough... don't need an iWatch. $aapl/n<pos> @gavparks what I find amazing after doing the analysis is SRPT and AAPL. At the time both were highly controversial/n<neu> For starters, i respect $AAPL's success but not a fan. Have android phone &amp; tablet &amp; win laptop, but still use ipod. Watch? no way, I pray!!/n<pos> @CNBCClosingBell  Does Twitter have any stake in $AAPL?Dividendmajic.I was pushing for Apple to buy out AMD as own Motorola.Still good move/n<pos> The #hardware improvement I was looking for from $AAPL was untangleable ear buds.  Alas, it remains on my list.  #tech #iPhone #iPhone6/n<neu> @chillok @maxcalibre i‚Äôd be surprised if it can leap to cost of iphone of course, i‚Äôm comparing to aapl devices as opposed to say, rolexes./n<neg> @belttari @rcwhalen @CNBCClosingBell @KateKellyCNBC @Stephanie_Link BUT I'm sick of the $aapl bashing so I'm on mute anyway!/n<neu> "@cruisectrl: "@RealFanboy101: "@cruisectrl: $AAPL only criminals care. i have nothing to hide/n<pos> @canuck2usa aapl is a far superior product is all i am saying./n<neg> $AAPL My sell at 101.28 doesn't quite feel as good today/n<neu> I'll say it... $AAPL back to 101 on close./n<pos> $AAPL That's exactly what I wanted to see happen test then retest now we can move higher/n<pos> Good red-green day for me. Holding $TSLA calls into tomorrow. Sold $AAPL 100x for 9-10% and still holding 105x/n<neu> @PolluxTechnical @A_F for the record, I am not &amp; have never P&amp;D stocks. I owned LQMT before the AAPL event and own the same shares today/n<neu> @dougkass @michaeloransky I believe the call was for $AAPL to be under 525 pre-split most of the year./n<pos> I like it $aapl! Any chance you can hit near $104 by Friday? Thx!/n<pos> @jimcramer $GRPN a buy with the integration of apple pay? Great coverage on apple.. I think your long term view on $aapl is spot on/n<neu> I'm going to assume that watch band makers are going to create additional straps that for the Apple Watch... $AAPL/n<neg> $AAPL bears, so vocal last night and this AM. And now ? Nary a pulse. odd that./n<neg> @cvpayne ...BTW, was at the $AAPL rollout yesterday. Don't think I'll be trading my everyday Yachtmaster for an iWatch. #justsaying/n<neg> If you got flushed on that $AAPL downgrade this morning (which I called BS on) ‚Ä¶ you've got some serious trading discipline issues./n<neg> I find Thursdays are particularly bearish for $AAPL when it‚Äôs in a down trend. We also have Pre-orders starting at Midnight Thu/Fri./n<neu> @jonasQuinn23 Let's talk when $AAPL launches boxers. I was expecting something new about smartwatch technologies./n<neg> ‚Äú@professorkev: $aapl train is leaving again, do not get in front if it‚Äùyou know what I'm saying?/n<neu> Y people expected sapphire displays on iPhone 6 beats me. Given the volumes $AAPL requires that $GTAT plant needed to be operational last yr/n<pos> $AAPL is Apple going to be valued as a growth company again? yes,will rocket the stock soon; a lot of expectation for ApplePay, i m long/n<neu> @MichaelOransky I have only traded AAPL infrequently in the last 12 months and I havent had an investment case since September 2012 (bear)./n<neu> @KeralaGuy77 AAPL looking better sad that I got stopped outüò©/n<neu> @monkbent take on AAPL watch introduction reminded me of @asymco Airshow take on presentations: did they set scene right to tell the story?/n<pos> @Catwoman2011 @CNBC @MarioGabelli don't cut yourself shortDeb,after all you are the Queen of AAPL..ThankYou for a huge gain for me..!!/n<neu> I was going to sell #AAPL but Apple Pay might do for payments what iTunes did for downloads./n<pos> $AAPL very impressive please read what I tweeted first thing.  Sell puts when they get fat on a down move like this am/n<pos> AAPL looks like a buy that is!! Analyst up to 116 - I say 120/n<neu> @StockKingz I might join u..no mention of nfc readers or the 043 patent yet..aapl lawsuit./n<neu> @CausalNexus which do I need to be careful of? AAPL SPLK/n<neu> @TheDomino wow.. am wondering if that is a pos or neg for $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL  now is Ibull, I will be looking into Iwatch for my son and daugther/n<neu> @wboscoho @Carl_C_Icahn Nope. But I did tweet earlier this morning to ask what his thoughts were on $EBAY following $AAPL news!/n<pos> "@sspencer_smb: $AAPL held key support this morning (98). if it closes above 101 i'm looking for it to resume uptrend..."/n<pos> $AAPL held key support this morning (98). if it closes above 101 i'm looking for it to resume uptrend.../n<neu> Started a very small, $AAPL 9/14 $99 PUT position.  If I see a drop below $100 on increasing volume, will add with stop at break even.../n<pos> I like Apple and $AAPL, but I'll need to be convinced the Watch is worth its price tag. Doesn't matter though, will prob sell like crazy./n<neu> @Scubadoobe i am bidding 150 at 99.1 99.4 was the pivot start $aapl. but i wont be surprised if big bad boys take this 95 again LOL./n<pos> I believe in $AAPL hitting $123 or better in the near future. Those selling now are going to miss all the profits./n<pos> $AAPL Was surprised by amount of profit taking (leading to strong fade) yesterday, still see 107+ Friday. I think close at 107.49 Fri./n<neu> Here is my one comment on $INVE, if u are hot money who bought on $AAPL spec, sell. If u are a trader, cool, I just want hot money out/n<neu> $AAPL $100 top (or $700 before split) was predicted months ago 4 new product launch. Only makes sense stock drops 3-5% from here short term/n<neu> @Scubadoobe still holding 150. i don't want to chase as i am pretty sure $aapl is going to rocket past 103. so hold core and trade around./n<neg> This is a reason why I think Samsung watches didn't take off. They're all essentially the same. It was the only one in town. $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL wrote $101 weeklies at 0.75c.  I don't see $102 in the cards by Friday.  +$1500 credit.  (already chipped away $300 in stop outs)/n<neg> @CramersShirt I first got into AAPL after stock dropped from 200 to 190 while Jobs was announcing the iPad. Everyone was disappointed./n<neu> Did you see ppl posting pics of analog watches? I did. It's about showing your personality through your watch. It's all about fashion. $AAPL/n<neg> I wonder why ppl buy ridiculous watches worth more than most cars. It's about being unique. Digital commoditizes the product of time. $AAPL/n<pos> I think that the iWatch will become a success. From what I can see, to start there is a great degree of customization and personality. $AAPL/n<neu> I expected to see a unicorn after so long of a wait. $AAPL/n<neu> $PANW gap starting to remind me of $AAPL in October 2004./n<neu> wouldnt chase $AAPL here..I took off all my longs from yesterday/n<neg> $AAPL watch ... no thanks.  Pulling a phone out of my pocket isn't so hard that I need the shortcut of a battery draining device on my wrist/n<pos> $AAPL at least apple is doing good. i hope it reaches its high again/n<pos> $AAPL $101 alert ‚Äî good recovery from yesterday‚Äôs lows but looks like this $100-$103 will continue to be key areas.. I may do covered calls/n<pos> My $AAPL call flys are in the green now.. I have such good luck w/ that spread lol/n<neu> I guess people were more impressed by $AAPL than I was./n<pos> $AAPL I approve./n<neg> Yeah, yeah, I know. You read about $V, $MA, $AXP and $AAPL over the weekend and wondering why you didn‚Äôt get any calls - you‚Äôll get over it/n<pos> $NQ_F $QQQ Ok, there's the breach of 101 in $AAPL I was waiting for. Its now viable for new shorts on all timeframes ( scalp and swing)/n<neu> @GuyAdami looks to me that neither aapl or IBM act like shorts   Has your thinking changed?/n<neu> Taking the $AAPL 98's... 60-70% is fine for half day and I'm prob. leaving some meat on bone../n<neu> $AAPL I'm in the "trading away profits mode".  oye....need to go to lunch./n<pos> @grassosteve @GuyAdami Long $AAPL. a close over $103 and I will buy more./n<neg> @Skipjackrick $AAPL covered again.  -$120 loss.  Chipping away at me.  I'll just wait till later./n<neu> @CourtMcDaniels I play for and against all day. $AAPL is headed higher but i think we hit 99s again in this hour. Could be wrong../n<pos> 1 thing I missed yesterday @ $AAPL's great unveil event

I agree with him on $aapl/n<pos> @DividendMaster Have a great celebration tonight! My niece turns 9 tomorrow. I see a Breyer horse in her near future, not anything $AAPL/n<neu> @dukerexx $AAPL she never fails does she? why she is still the market leader. I don‚Äôt care what anyone else says about you/n<neg> How is that downgrade working for you on Apple....LOL, idiots.  I told you to cover those puts and shorts!  Apple (AAPL) heading to $125/n<neg> @ReformedBroker --Aapl Pay-all the people that have credit cards on I-Tunes-obviously will not have an I- 6-so current market is much less/n<pos> @optionmonster @petenajarian Picked up more $AAPL under $98 in Afterhours last night. I believe we see $110-115 this year, if not higher./n<neu> @jimcramer Jim,  I am a long term holder of AAPL is this a good time to start adding a schnitzel of shares?/n<pos> I'd like to see if the $aapl watch will inflate the whole watch market. That'd be interesting./n<neu> @CNBCFastMoney Here is how I see this $EBAY debate.  Icahn who is big on $AAPL will encourage a buyout of $EBAY merge paypal, n sell de rest/n<neu> $AAPL going to write calls as soon as I see weakness in this.  Tough trade though.  Trying to be careful./n<pos> 1/ Lots of commentary about yesterday's $AAPL announcements. Good showing. Figured it was time to compile mine (note: I'm still long shares)/n<pos> And now my $aapl trade is up 35%.  I can afford to take my family out for dinner!/n<neu> @Weeb644 Why are you playing against $AAPL? not that I don't blame ya, just curious/n<neu> "@WallStFarmer: $AAPL I miss the $85 price targets from yesterday's shorts..." Hilarious. Well said/n<neg> @WalterLiveOak Yesterday, You said,"I don't have to listen to him, he is just wrong". Would you say the same thing today or not! SHORT AAPL./n<pos> @jimcramer @Stephanie_Link Glad I bought more $AAPL last night in AH./n<pos> @i_like_bb_stock google otiv and the 043 patent there could b much more upside to this if they enforce their patent against aapl./n<pos> @HLNTV @PRguitarman I like my Mickey Watch better! Looks like Mr. Cook dropped the Ball on this one! SHORT $AAPL for drop to $60 soon! DOWN!/n<pos> @Scubadoobe $nvda trying to do RDR at 19.55. $aapl looks really good. i would recommend getting 200 but remember it is crazy volatile./n<neu> @nachoswithsalsa I'm about to do so on my aapl calls, nxt week expiry. Looks like they are up 15% in the past 10 minutes.  All 2 of them./n<neg> @RedlerAllAccess scot can you explain to me why nobody says aapl stock has done NOTHING ! if you bought it in September 2012!/n<neg> @ScottWapnerCNBC I cant believe you still don't get it. Why are you so skeptical about aapl? Wake up/n<neu> @cvpayne @Doc_I Wow...R u holding? Do u think they still have the $AAPL biz? Don't tend to be influenced in indv inv, I prefer to blv in Co./n<neu> @cvpayne @Doc_I Maybe $GTAT didn't get the phones right now because of the HUGE $aapl Watch selection and need to hold it for that. Future ?/n<neg> As an $AAPL shareholder, can someone explain what the watch does? I am still Bullish on the name of course./n<neu> @cesarsalazar yeah, the idea that Apple is dead on innovation is silly, I'm 67% up on $AAPL/n<neu> I only have one little question...whatever happened to $AAPL tv?/n<neg> @OrwellUpgraded @ErrataRob Google has competition, that's how I mostly avoid their services. NFLX has competition: AMZN, AAPL, VUDU, etc./n<neu> if "mobil" is the future &amp; $FB is leading mobile=&gt; I cant c a billion ppl staring at this tiny screen of $aapl watch./n<neg> @petenajarian Wiess is a hot mess. I luv him like my ex mom inlaw that I had committed way back in my str8 days.He just doesn't get it $AAPL/n<neu> I didn't realize apple was spelt AAPL @ToriGrima/n<pos> I find that I enjoy trading much more if I don't look at my screens.... $SPY $AAPL/n<neu> I don't think party is over $GTAT but $AAPL said nothing and $GLW hinting they got the business...I wouldn't add yet but think hold RT@Doc_I/n<pos> If $AAPL can stay above this level, I'm adding to my long position./n<neu> ‚Äú@DougKass: and where the company is in it's life cycle. No doubt I will get alot of pushback. But its my view. $AAPL‚Äù&lt;~All trades 2 sided/n<neg> i can feel the ratings slipping even further for #CNBC with their 48 hour commercial for $AAPL/n<neu> and where the company is in it's life cycle.
