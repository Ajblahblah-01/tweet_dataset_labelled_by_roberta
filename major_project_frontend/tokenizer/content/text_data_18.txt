$AAPL/n<neg> My dream last night

Bought 1200 $AAPL Calls, stock spiked and was up over a million dollars

Then my system crashed and I couldn't get out of my position

When system came back online I had lost it all and was down six figures

Woke up in a panic

Ever have "the trading dream"?/n<neu> @QvXrj @Kelly06932285 @NorthmanTrader @carlquintanilla @Schuldensuehner Much appreciated! That much I understand.

Headlines say no way, chart says dude $420(ay)!

 #StockMarket #StockStowatch/n<neu> Good afternoon! Let me know if there are any specific names you want to know important levels of.

Few I‚Äôm currently watching next week:

$SPX $QQQ $NFLX $GOOGL $ISRG $MSFT $FB $AAPL $TSLA $ISRG $BA $CMG $NOW $ROKU $TTD/n<neu> I‚Äôll do $twtr live video on the stock I‚Äôm talking about. My last public video discussed how to buy $aapl at $247ish and why I was in $msft $139ish.  This next name could go 50 points over the next two months. üëç/n<pos> @SlopeOfHope This is the only stock every fund manager in the universe can pile into with a feeling of safety.  I‚Äôm of the opinion that $AAPL has more control of market sentiment than $SPY at the moment.   Spidey senses are tingling like crazy./n<neg> Gonna start covering a longer-term portfolio.

Posting intraday trades doesn't make much sense and is rather cumbersome sometimes.

So, on Monday I'll spend 100k on a portfolio with a 3-6 month horizon.  Let's see how it goes!

#no $MSFT $AAPL $TWTR $GOOG #investing #portfolio/n<pos> @jimcramer Jim, I have owned, not traded $AAPL since 2010. My conundrum now is, it's grown to 20% of my portfolio, and I'm up over 200%, isn't it prudent to trim here at all time highs? Thank you./n<pos> @AnorakRTC @jimcramer great call on apple. i sold my $AAPL a year or so ago, when it became obvious iphone sales had peaked. little did i know the stock would immediately double from there haha./n<neu> Top 4 positions in the port now by size are:  $AAPL, $BRK.B, $MU, $FB.  $BRK.B to me is sort of between equity and cash as long as near 1.4x book./n<neu> @4thQuarterCap @MikeBellafiore I will buy the dip on any $AAPL panic if the trade war continues/n<neu> This is my current watchlist:

$AAPL

$DIA
$DIS
$ETSY
$FB
$GLD
$GOOGL
$GS

What am I missing?/n<pos> @Barton_options I‚Äôve no issues buying more AAPL on the dip/n<pos> Whenever it happens, I‚Äôm just gonna make sure I‚Äôm ready to catch the $AAPL short, should make my week if I execute ü§ë/n<neu> 9/ Investors should always view smart competition as "risks." And I will definitely be monitoring $PYPL's numbers to ensure our thesis is still intact. 

But I believe $AAPL Pay, $AMZN Pay, $GOOGL Pay, etc will have a hard time replicating PayPal's universal payments platform./n<neu> History on $aapl music was something I was secretly asking for./n<neu> @SullyCNBC On a side note Sully, do I need to hold $AAPL?/n<pos> As this year nears its end, I have certainly learned a lot about myself and what I'm capable of.

Can I buy $20 worth of $aapl instead of having to figure out the percentage?/n<pos> @jimcramer love what you do. I would love your take on using out-of-the money Leaps to do a little profit taking without selling stock as a covered call play. AAPL 1/21 $300 call is $16. I like the cover for solid 15% upside and $16 of downside protection keeping the DIV./n<pos> Better day today, although meetings kept me from the #TrickTrades morning plan of attack, I still caught the upside of $NVDA off that upswing of the daily 9 and banked some $AAPL off the two-day VWAP push. Made up for Friday‚Äôs crash and burn. Back on schedule, but must focus./n<pos> @GS_CapSF Concentration of positions thats all, seems all pretty self fulfilling to me no? Diversification comes from within the investment of AAPL and MSFT and what they do with their cash...pretty self explanatory...he who holds the cash holds the keys.../n<pos> $AAPL that‚Äôs a great close for $AAPL....love that and makes me think this should be on watch in the am for a possible alert/n<neg> @selenicerea I've not played AAPL but honestly. Yeah, I feel that. Like, I still get mileage out of telling people I wept for 20 solid minutes playing Unwound Future because people never expect just how fucking severe the swerves in Layton are/n<pos> @TradingThomas3 Apple announces press event üòÇ I guess they will show off AAPL stock/n<pos> Wife asked me to subscribe to Disney Plus and Apple TV because everyone on Facebook is talking about Mandolorian and Morning Show.  $FB $DIS $AAPL/n<neu> Something I‚Äôm learning in the markets is, follow the trend,Yes I wanted to short $AAPL, but it‚Äôs not the time yet/n<neu> Today's top news:

$spy $spx $aapl $amzn $mu $amd $baba $fb $Nflx $googl $bac $jpm $wmt $hd $cost $dal $t $x/n<neu> When I see $AAPL soaring to all time highs, I wish I owned more.  Then I look at $MJ as a reminder why I limit any individual holding to a small percentage of my portfolio.  I consider the pot stocks as a speculative non-diversified investment like an individual stock./n<neg> @vm_one1 Blackberry coming with new model, sorry AAPL. (Shame BullStreetSpiegel blocked me :/)/n<neg> @ClementsMoney Yes. Because they listen to their financial advisors! I have been way over-weight AAPL for  5 years. No advisor would do that for a customer./n<neu> $cvna thinking of going short. I believe the global economy slowing will ultimately impact car sales in general. This is the level that I would short. With $86 as a stop. $amrn $krtx $roku $fb $aapl/n<neg> @GarethSoloway So well said my friend. AAPL is just off the charts? Just doing buy backs every day non stop? As to buy this up here sure feels risky. I will say we did not have the FED Or ECB just pumping $ in to the markets like this and neg rates? Just feels so over bought and every 1 buying?/n<pos> $AAPL is unreal.  Put buyers like myself are getting SPANKED!  Luckily I went in with debit spreads./n<neu> I'm hedging in this 3120-25 zone.  Nothing heroic. Long book not very strong today but for the always-ridiculous $AAPL. Happy to remove it over 3125 and get more tips from the bulls./n<pos> Each ‚Äúlike‚Äù and ‚Äúretweet‚Äù will be an entry to win and once we reach 500 followers, I will announce the winner!!

All my models have broken down, you have to wait until AAPL gaps up 5 percent or something for the exhaustion. It's like being out in the woods and strangling a squirrel trading now lol. Get down &amp; dirty üòèüòòüòòüòò/n<neu> @Sparkdog10 I didn‚Äôt yet.

Puts for:

$AAPL

Trades are $15,000 for each, looking to exit at 5% profit or $750.

For All Mankind &amp; The Morning Show - not as bad as first impression. They warm up after first episode. I think they‚Äôre planning on soap-like longevity to keep subs active, so very slow moving. But people seem to like that./n<neu> British tech company IQE down 20% after their second warning in five months.

Huawei/n<neu> @nicolasfurno Also, why am I not surprised?/n<neu> @davemark I‚Äôd make them supports with a sharpie of different colors, then sell the art üòÑ./n<neg> @M1cha31Patr1ck I would also say if rich person owns shares of a dividend stock like MSFT or AAPL, no one accuses them of being lazy for getting paid a quarterly dividend for doing nothing except owning the stock. @AndrewYang is saying we Americans own our country just like any stockholder./n<neg> $PG and $AMZN. I'll give the bears those two. They look a little weak. But with $MSFT and $AAPL chugging along - which together are over 8.5% of the S&amp;P 500 - combined with $BRK.B $JPM and $GOOGL(another 6%+), I just don't see the weight of evidence in favor of the bears yet./n<neu> Just spent all weekend back-testing my updated system. Over 2 years of data across 700+ stocks.

If good design to you is Porsche and Porsche only I totally understand your ... slight dislike of the proposal here üòâ.

Although model S and 3 are far closer to ¬´¬†bulbous things you like¬†¬ª üòã, aren‚Äôt they?/n<neu> @osxreverser Meh üòã.

It‚Äôs just a bomb on wheels, would I answer üòã.

I mean, our bet is still on üòâ./n<neu> @osxreverser Soooo, you‚Äôre the shortest shorts guy? üòã 

It‚Äôs got to be just that, right? 

I mean... else, you‚Äôd love Porsche so much? üòâ/n<neu> 6/ $AAPL Above us currently the next target at 100% on the fib extension (since we are in uncharted territory) would be about $278. Down to the daily and hourly, if price can‚Äôt hold 256, I would fully expect we test $250 and so on./n<pos> @osxreverser I mean, given the type of cars you like. I understand üòã.

If we‚Äôre talking about the same thing, it‚Äôs beautiful, IMHO üòâ./n<neu> $AMD

That's why I said a difference between:

All those 300 SPY calls this year were probably sabotaged. Money lost. I won't yell anymore.

NB $AAPL Card already offers 3% cash back on transactions from certain vendors/n<pos> $PYPL For consumers, the initial value add was reduced friction at checkout when shopping online.

They predicted AAPL price moves from $265 at 3Q 2019, $332 at 1Q 2021, to $400 by 4Q 2022 (the black line). $AAPL/n<neu> For this purpose, I first used last 10 years' worth of financial data to find such a relationship (multiple regression). $AAPL/n<neu> To this end, I used the analysts' consensus of forward estimates of each metric.

$tsla $amzn $goog $aapl $unh $nke $ma $fb $msft/n<pos> @PlainSite I enjoy a lot of your work but these kinds of posts just tend to show a lack of understanding about capital markets

It went up because the overall market is bullish and AAPL is a blue chip tech stock, if market sentiment changes it will go back down (as in Dec 2018)/n<neg> boy they've turned this entire thing into one giant circus. got rammed up thu ass with margin callz this week, took around $25K loss on $SPY $AAPL $GOOGL $RH thankgod for $ULTA saved my ass a little. still, i've had enuff, takin a break, catch everyone next friday im done for now/n<neg> This makes me think of a conversation I had with @NuitSeraCalme about buying $AAPL and $DIS two years ago.

Oddly enough, I don‚Äôt particularly like making my predicts on Apple to the general public. I have stopped writing about the stock for the most part. $AAPL/n<pos> Apple Bulls Are Frogs

Summary
My 2019 prediction for Apple was met with skepticism but turned out correct.

I make another prediction: Apple will sell off in December.

Avoiding just December can give you 53% more profits than buy-and-hold.

$AAPL/n<neg> I don't think it will be possible for Apple stock to sustain its bullish momentum in the near term due to already high valuation and declining EPS. $AAPL/n<pos> Price reduction was inevitable
Last year, I mentioned that Apple could reduce the price to sub-$650 for iPhone XR in a Seeking Alpha article. It received a lot of pushback from other contributors and commenters. $AAPL/n<pos> So, is Apple overvalued? Not necessarily. I remain bullish on Apple, but investors should curb their enthusiasm a bit on further price gains. $AAPL/n<neu> @stroughtonsmith Finally some of the important people who notice it üòÑ.

You‚Äôre right.

They need markets up for weekend spin.. headlines, socials, Sunday "shows"... $AAPL will have a huge up day along with $MSFT $NKE et al.

The reason is wearables. It‚Äôs not valued the same as in 2015 bc it‚Äôs not just an iPhone company./n<pos> @LMantilero Mr. Dandy PLEASE put a timmer on your phone and stick with it...you don't want to get burned out.  

So say, I'm going to study AAPL for 15 minutes....or maybe 30...then take a break, set it aside for a day and come back to it.  You will thank me later:)/n<neu> @DanRusso_CMT @jimiuorio I agree the FED is just a factor but when you have free money lent to corps to buy back shares to prop up stock price it is just another example of it not bein a real market.

Most of which remain in place. It seems like the market is also undergoing a fundamental change. Like $AAPL cap &gt; energy sector/n<neu> @Slim5of7 AAPL was easily a max because it went to all time highs (we sold puts).

Happy to walk away with small win yesterday./n<pos> @Slim5of7 I think I made good decisions on LULU and AAPL both over $1k profit. I made a boneheaded move not taking the $1k profit I had on BYND last Friday. Sold that for $250 loss and $230 loss on TSLA that would have been max profit. TSLA got lucky with $500 price target last minute tho./n<neg> @hks55 I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong on $AAPL. Great calls this past week. I may need to take a break.

Apart from $SHOP I sold all others with short-term gains. The compounding effect of stocks cannot be overstated. Had I held on, my overall portfolio would be 3X today./n<neu> @NioClaus @puppyeh1 @CVCResearch @JCOviedo6 @jimcramer yes, people do move on to other jobs.  This isn't the 1950s where you're a lifer.  As they leave, others come fill the positions.  Should I look at other companies and see their executive changes?  Didn't $aapl just announce one of their executives leaving? AAPL about to go BK?/n<neu> @rationalwalk If recent history is a guide, I doubt AAPL slows the pace of buybacks as the share price climbs. They unfortunately seem to have a much greater appetite for their own shares when times are good.

The #CHINA trade could knock 15%+ off from Apple in a flash.  It‚Äôs a SELL today.  Revisit on Monday.üëçüèª/n<neg> I don‚Äôt understand how $AAPL dips on weak China sales.

$AAPL tried to compensate for lack of 5G phone by lowering prices instead of leading...didn't work. that's why they stopped breaking out iPhone #'s. so, they're slow + late, but not stupid. new 5G phone next yr./n<neg> Sure, theres a lot of demand for $AAPL Airpods (cant get them until mid-Jan)....but isn't this a big Apple supply chain failure?

Looking to have a personal best in 2020, learned so much in 2019.

#noweeklies/n<neu> @CNBCFastMoney Let's summarize, AAPL is at 279.52, Dan Nathan recommend to sale AAPL: 10/6 @ 227, 10/25 @ 247, 12/14 @ 280. I get it, keep recommending to sale at higher price, eventually it will pull back and then Adami will give him Kudos for be "all over it"./n<neg> @atom_finance enjoying the app, but getting alerts that are just plain wrong: AAPL down 6.2% after hours, SVN down 14.7% after hours....DM me and I can send you screen shots./n<pos> The color of $AAPL is red, I repeat: RED! #Miracles/n<neg> Oops, stop took me out already $AAPL Dec20 280c 1.75 &gt; 1.82/n<pos> Apple AirPod pros are really good. The first version I hated too. Massive improvement and a great product. Apple will have a good holiday. They‚Äôre offering 6% off on Apple Pay with Apple Card. $aapl/n<neu> I understand $AAPL dec revs, however, they produce a status symbol idolized by the masses. 

bought a lot of shares back in the last decade, but they‚Äôre also sitting on enough cash to buy most small countries. 

Comparing $AAPL valuation to late 90s tech w/no sales is a fallacy/n<neu> @CUIN2forreal Considering her former ties to $AAPL if Ms. Heinen considers $VERB ‚Äúhighly unique disruptive technology‚Äù, I‚Äôd tend to believe her. #TippingPoint/n<pos> @shiladitya @abhishek_tri @Vested_finance I use interactive brokers and yes AAPL has been really good this year. I'm betting on DIS and MSFT too, lets see./n<pos> Also, I expect services to grow a bit faster in 2020 as Apple adds revenue from the new services. As I have explained, I expect this growth to halt in the second half of the year.

$AAPL/n<neu> As I mentioned before, I have exited my long position in Apple and I have decided to short Apple with a small portion of these profits. The main reason is that I expect Apple to see slow growth in the coming year. $AAPL/n<neu> I also criticized Apple for not having a cheap smartphone in its lineup as it started expanding to the services segment. It seems the management listened as the company is expected to launch a $400 phone in 2020.

$AAPL/n<neg> I believe that Apple has missed many opportunities as it continued to rely on iPhone revenue. For example, I have never understood why the company failed to diversify its revenue by expanding to offering enterprise services like cloud. $AAPL/n<pos> Final Thoughts
I have been fortunate to have invested in Apple for a few years now. At the same time, I have been critical about the company for many years. $AAPL/n<neu> While Arcade‚Äôs price is relatively low, I believe that Apple will have a difficult time attracting many gamers. In fact, a quick Google trends search for cancel Apple arcade shows that the number has been increasing. $AAPL/n<neg> Apple Arcade is another service I don‚Äôt expect to have a lot of success. Apple Arcade lets users pay a standard $4.99 fee to play unlimited games. $AAPL/n<neu> While Apple has responded to this lawsuit, I believe that SPOT will win, partly because of where the lawsuit has been filed. This suit could affect one part of Apple‚Äôs services revenue.

$AAPL/n<pos> Fortunately, as I wrote in March, I have continued to own a small stake of Apple in my portfolio. $AAPL/n<pos> Summary
Apple is the best performing FAANG stock in 2019.

Apple will face significant challenges in its services segment in 2020.

I see no catalysts that will push Apple stock higher.

My short position represents the smallest part of my portfolio.

$AAPL/n<pos> While I still think Apple is one of the best names to own right now, it's always good for investors to be aware of the biggest risks involved with any name, especially when shares are trading near their all-time high. $AAPL/n<neg> because we saw what happened with that fear at last year's holiday time. Perhaps the biggest risk I see now is that the valuation has jumped quite a bit, and that doesn't make Apple that cheap anymore, especially when it means weaker effective capital returns. $AAPL/n<neu> Final thoughts
As Apple shares sit just a few dollars from their all-time high, I wanted to examine what I thought were the three biggest risks for the stock today. In the immediate future, the US/China trade war remains large, $AAPL/n<neu> Had the yearly rate been that 25.47% average I mentioned above, the company would have reported more than $6.25 billion less in net income, ending with $10.54 in EPS. That's a difference of $1.35, more than 11.3%.
$AAPL/n<pos> Whether they do or not, taxes on big business and millionaires/billionaires have become a key talking point lately. I bring this aspect up because with President Trump's tax cut plan, Apple's GAAP effective tax rate has dropped quite a bit.
$AAPL/n<neu> Part of what I also consider in a value investment is the capital a name is returning to investors. As you can most likely expect, a surge in a stock means its annual dividend yield is going to drop. $AAPL/n<neg> Obviously, as I discussed above, another round of tariffs going into effect would be a negative for Apple, and you would see analysts cutting their numbers across the board.

$AAPL/n<neg> As we get down to the final few weeks of 2019, I'd like to look at a couple of the biggest risks facing the name currently.

$AAPL/n<pos> @PeterTrader99 For me in the last 3 years its been more than 80% profitable, because of trading only ES_F and leaps $aapl, $amzn./n<pos> WL 12/18/19 Options

Hello, tomorrow my main watch is PTON going to be looking for dips
I think this name can really show some strength into some calls also watching AMZN and BA as my top watches going into tomorrow. Must make sure my sizing is right./n<neu> I remember in 2009(?) when $aapl was around $84 a share...

then it jumped to over 600 in five or so years before splitting 

hindsight is 20/20 yes I know 

I‚Äôm not an expert (no shit) but if you watch the space closely you can make informed guesses / assumptions/n<neg> @quinnnorton 6 pages!? üò± (I‚Äôm ‚Ä¶. not reading that üòÑ)./n<pos> @quinnnorton But climbing is wonderful! üôÇ (one of the many sports I practice üôà)./n<neu> As I may have pointed out a 1000 times or so, there's a "Trump ecosystem", just like Apple/Google have an app ecosystem. All provide a platform others use to profit. With AAPL/GOOG it's app developers. With Trump it's both r/w *and leftwing* grifters.

#MAGA #resist/n<neu> @ignore89039500 I am long too. If you would have said AAPL would be my best US performer by some margin a year ago, I would have laughed you off of Twitter :)/n<neu> @Barton_options Nooooooo.

I just bought some ultra bullish lottery tickets on $aapl/n<neu> @Powerserious I will focus on AAPL &amp; TSLA to confirm/n<pos> @RedDogT3 @Chartrambler Let Me add AAPL is really far away from the 200dma you can back test this day chart. Only two out comes you come in or time has to go by as the 200dma moves up. AAPL is a rocker so being short has a high % to play! Good hunting. If you played this in the past it paid out./n<neg> @OptionsLocator I‚Äôm surprised they haven‚Äôt split all these monster names yet - they really should

$aapl was 7/1 - wasn‚Äôt it like $1400? I don‚Äôt remember anymore lol/n<neu> @LessIsMor3 I‚Äôd be curious what their rating has been on $AAPL for the last two years./n<neg> @WallStGodFather @PRStockTrading Yeah I got hit on my $AAPL today.

AAPL has a gap to fill $275 area/n<neu> @cohicks @drand4life Everyone has a different investment philosophy...

All in on $AAPL in 2012/13 worked for me prior to rolling it all into $TSLA/n<neu> Doing my research tonight to figure out when the sellers will show up based on many statistical facts.

Feel free to subscribe, like and retweet to support our work üëç/n<neu> @FlyrUsr I am not sure but Buffet could be selling AAPL in the dark pools probably back to AAPL with their huge buyback program. It would then be obvious that retail would not see the stealth distribution since in open markets a size of that distribution would move price more dramatically/n<pos> @HarksIoT @LinkedIn Agree 100% Scott. Still a lot to do as an industry on the device level (I say we‚Äôre in the top half of the second inning) but it‚Äôs an exciting move to see GOOG, AMZN &amp; AAPL working together./n<pos> Guys I think $AAPL is looking good here guys. 

I‚Äôm seeing iPhones 11s everywhere now.

#StonksAdvice/n<pos> @quinnnorton I don‚Äôt ever look at them. But the news section on DuckDuckGo fulfilled my curiosity./n<neu> @quinnnorton What is happening ?! üòÑ (I‚Äôll google it‚Ä¶ I mean, ü¶Ü ü¶Ü Go üòÑ)./n<neu> The $279 support keeps seeing buying. $Aapl seen as low risk stock for the Hedge Funds. Could this be a $500 over the next couple of years? But I can't trade the future what if. All I can do is take entry's where the odds are in my favor to win, manage risk, then hold the winner./n<pos> @JeffCooperLive That AAPL chart looks interesting. The 281 mark keeps rejecting and the last three days candles lead me to believe a bigger move is coming/n<neu> @oblique369 /3.. so, say, after I take care of all those things oh, and I still have $1,000 to buy a phone, yes, I could buy a $300 Android and then, what, 3 shares of $AAPL ,  lol?/n<pos> One reflection I've had this year came to me after noticing stunning nature of $AAPL this year. The stock literally doubled in a declining operating environment. How long can I as a trader stay in business when a stock in everyone's portfolio rallies 100% in 1 year?/n<neu> I suppose says like this don‚Äôt happen very often. Caught a few bags:
Long: 
$AMT
$ANET
$NFLX
$TTD
$ROKU on that pop
$TSLA scalp

Fails:
$AAPL I think it could run tomorrow 
$WYNN stuck in range 

See profit, take profit, let the rest run./n<pos> @JMendelK Are you looking to try and get back in?  I've been doing options, generally cheaper and easier to make (and lose) though rh but investing mainly in the stocks I normally stick with. 

AAPL is usually a good bet for long calls. Tesla and Nvdia have been going crazy the past week/n<neu> Doing more trades on your down days rarely helps. I thino when you are having a good day you will keep winning, and on a bad one you will keep losing. Thats why I do same a mouth of trades each session. About 2. $spy $spx $es $aapl $goog $tsla $c/n<neu> @stroughtonsmith If I remember well, they even put some reference in there that wasn‚Äôt in the upgrade choices by Apple üôÇ./n<pos> $EORZ adding more round .0250.

$amrn $dbmm $alpp $nwbo $coop $vyst $fnma $snpw $avxl $funn $rbnw $ipix $fles $kblb $nio $acb $baba $avx $aapl $msft/n<pos> The fact that $AMZN has yet to breakout is a positive catalyst for the entire stock market. 

$AAPL could take a breather and $AMZN could lead the way from here. 

I like this set up. 

#MeltUpContinues/n<pos> Finally a less choppy day for $SPX. New ATH and getting close to that big 3200 resistance. 

I like the action on it so far, with $AAPL lagging./n<neu> @HedgehogOptions Got some Feb lotto calls on $AAPL
I expect a rise on this bad boy come January./n<neu> Old $AAPL might sled on down to 276. Crazy talk I know. But it‚Äôs blinking./n<pos> @4Awesometweet I want to take some $AAPL profits here, buy $ALB and $SHAK     I agree @4Awesometweet   Everyone is too optimistic/n<pos> Dow, Nasdaq, they are so strong. maybe i should think about putting more money on US stocks like apple, google, and onconova..
$AAPL $GOOG $ONTX/n<pos> Yesterday $aapl made a new ATH at 289.9 then boom dropped crazy 2 points into close. Its a good warning that its already at its max and investors are about to pull out at this high price. I‚Äôm going to start buying puts on feb options exp right after er, will load up till  max 300/n<neu> @oliviazhan1205 AAPL is dropping in premarket, I think to work on the downtrend now, imo :)/n<neu> Flat AAPL swing sold 1k shares +$50, Flat TVIX swing sold 1k shares -$160, unwinding all my positions before the holidays..this market needs a pullback probably happens today but i gotta protect my year and enjoy the holidays fought it for 3 days thats enough/n<neu> TIL that @HansZimmer 's Prague show is on $AAPL music.

I'll be streaming it through my $AMZN Echo.

I may interrupt the show to ask Alexa to buy me more toothpaste.

She will respond in @SamuelLJackson's voice,

 I called the short last year around the top @ $232.00.
 Then the buy in January @ $147.00.

Going to build a track and field team?/n<neu> @rgutrez @BeckyQuick So is there a bond that has outperformed $AAPL in past 10 years? Asking because I don‚Äôt follow a bond market./n<pos> I have it in my head that $AAPL will top - at least for a while right at 284 -- a perfect double off the 142 low from January. This happens all the time for psychological reasons and AAPL is trading on nothing more than money flow./n<neu> @Barton_options U think they actually tighten things up in terms of lending to HF overnight as well/accepting their aapl shares as collateral? 

How are you calculating the ‚Äúsevere‚Äù underuse? Makes sense high level but how do u know underuse will be ‚Äúsevere‚Äù and not just slightly underused/n<pos> 1-1 Trade and coaching room., [Dec 20, 2019, at 9:21 AM]

Tim Cook‚Äôs children and parents, all alcoholics with homosexual tendencies, are in my area.

Very doubtful all any brain dead investor has to do again is Buy the #1 stock in the world AAPL and make 80%+. With the election coming up it's almost certain to not be ZERO volatility like 2019./n<pos> I think I‚Äôll do a video Monday about my next stock that can go $50-$100 points in the next month.

Neat!/n<neu> @AndysCycles I‚Äôm guessing aapl has something to do with that/n<neu> @chrisbrecher @PLHstock @TrendSpider It struck me that maybe it accounts for the down day for AAPL on Friday, seeing g how it outperformed most stocks. I havent run the numbers yet but want to see how the rebalance lines up with trading direction on Friday. Hope I'm on the right track there./n<neu> @magicmatt777 Researched chip makers for aapl phones.

Fake times, fake economics./n<pos> @ConsensusContr1 $TSLA is the $AAPL of the auto world. Nobody ever saw phone profits as high as Apple did, since they were first and ahead of the curve.

I‚Äôm long $AAPL but smaller position at  higher cost basis/n<neu> @rationalwalk I‚Äôve lived a charmed investing life. My dad &amp; I invest together to a large degree but well predating that he  bought me 10 $AAPL shares right around  IPO (I was a baby) &amp; forgot all about it.

Though I did ace the last couple of wiggles, I think over a "many years" time frame, I have probably had to chase to get the shares back./n<neu> @bill_fouche 1) I didn‚Äôt forget about 2018. The overall market did roughly the same thing as AAPL.
2) The 2018 drop (Apple finished the year roughly inline with market) was not a black swan.
3) That drop ends up being a byproduct of passive vs. active investing dynamic - just in reverse./n<neg> Same deal w/ AAPL, AIG, Ashtead... and those are just the A's. 

I did well coming out of that selloff, but could have done much better. This probably cost me more outperformance than anything else here./n<neu> @cpraderas I have not written up a piece on defining a new AAPL target since it smoked my 258-269 range.

Let me re-frame my question: mathematically speaking, how much higher (longer) can a small handful of gigantic stocks (aapl, msft, googl, amzn, brka, jpm, etc) power the S&amp;P INDEX, even while your broad ‚Äúinternals‚Äù are weak? This melt up has been truly amazing!/n<pos> @MoonOverlord not short $btc, but I am short $aapl :)/n<pos> @RedDogT3 Changed mine 100% I love aapl and will always love it!/n<neu> @themooncarl @IvanOnTech @sunnydecree I follow a @ianlopuch  who analyzes stocks. Every time he talks about a stock he says, "disclosure, I'm long AAPL." Maybe if you do that, YouTube won't ban you. Or, put a disclaimer at the beginning of every video?/n<pos> @newsfilterio $aapl will win the bid, I believe.  Apple save overhead and increase net revenue./n<pos> $Aapl.  I hope Apple is happy.  So many Apple products under the tree this year!/n<neg> @optionslion8 @brad2181 @WallStSai There was one time I was in $AAPL calls, he was in puts. Negative headline, he retweeted that headline copying me on the body of tweet. I didn‚Äôt appreciate it since I was opposite side. I warned him but he laughed so blocked him. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> I should have asked only for "AAPL ID instant verification" from üéÖü§∂xmas 2019 ü§£(vs new iwatch) But that may need #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning  and some uninvented #technology ..right AAPL?....Hello #Pixel4 @Google @Android ...coming.../n<pos> So far best questions I‚Äôve been asked by family ‚ÄúWhat stock is the best for 2020‚Äù I‚Äôm thinking about buying $AAPL here‚Äù what about $NFLX looks good‚Äù have you heard of $ROKU ‚Äú also you should look into this weed stock it‚Äôs going to go big time‚Äù ....‚ÄùME someone give me another üç∫ ‚Äú/n<neg> @schristakos I told myself when it dips below $300 I‚Äôm buying more shares... so I bought 60 more shares at $295 and within weeks it was under $200 ‚Äî this hurt terribly. 

When it finally settled I almost bought $6K more... but instead I bought more AAPL (which is kicking ass for me)/n<pos> @TraderKarthik We have been so why not let it continue lol 

$aapl $amd streaming numbers are so good we should just double their stock value - makes sense/n<pos> @drboycewatkins1 I agree, I‚Äôm doing that for my nieces and nephews.
MSFT, V, DIS, AMD, FB, AAPL yo name a few and hold on to them.
Pot stocks are beaten down right now it might be an opportunity./n<neg> Great. Now I‚Äôm an alien. $aapl everywhere/n<pos> @MDCin303 @lindsayebarnett Right??! My mind was blown when LIndsay showed me her new gadget last week.
hint: it‚Äôs ~40% cheaper on amzn than aapl/n<neg> @TTHisreal well you can see the Stoch at 90 right ? Trix/MACD looking toppy . I am not interested in seeing how high AAPL will go, I just want to catch the downward move in USA tech sector as a whole with a suitable ETF . AAPL is the bell weather stock, so just mentioned it./n<pos> @hdevalence I LOVE IT! (Hadn‚Äôt really had time to play for the past year, but it‚Äôs definitely my favorite game üôÇ)./n<neg> I need a quick break in 2020 with one of my ‚Äòlottery‚Äô stocks. Looking to make some money to invest into $AMD and $AAPL. I can‚Äôt believe I sold all my 1000 shares of AMD at $11. What the heck was I thinking!?/n<neu> @traderbluke @farrisbaba @adammoretto1 It's a biased trendline. He's clearly short and hoping this is the top. Sorry Ferris, can't get back you up on this one. The move in $aapl is not fed induced, it is well deserved. No position, but I do wish I had one./n<neg> @Melt_Dem No. I do not agree with you. If that is the case, then AMZN and AAPL would not have reached ATH./n<neg> @CallMeShylo @strangerwriters @41Strange @Stranger_Things Im thrown too much aapl premium short , in trouble, should had kept es short. Help me Shylo./n<pos> I just want 5 stocks that each increase 1% everyday.  It must be possible.  Come on $BABA, $MRVL, $CRSP, $SWKS, and $AAPL. Lead the way./n<pos> @Mikes_Charts I nearly bought these at .45 this morning. Went 5 bags! LOL. Scalped $AAPL calls for 83%, and added small $AMD. Can't complain, but dayum!üòÅüòé/n<pos> Nov and Dec getting better and kind of doubled whole year returns!

Come on bulls, give up already üòÄ/n<neu> @Quarry_Rock I wonder if $AAPL and $MSFT will keep pace with $AMZN. If so, oh boy!/n<neu> @JPMachado65 @farrisbaba I think he‚Äôs positioned short from 300 points ago.  Or in AAPL terms, $50-$60 dollars ago./n<neu> I guess it‚Äôs safe to say $AAPL going to $300/n<neu> Lot of opportunities in $aapl and $amzn today, I should have focused on these rather than $tsla and $roku, made some of the morning losses back in $amzn but still ending red -$400. Need to have a different mindset to trade stocks like $amzn/n<pos> $AAPL was my favorite stock for a LONG time, at $1.3 TRILLION market cap I can no longer say that‚Äôs true. (It‚Äôs still only a 24 P/E btw, which shows just how absurd it was at $140!)/n<pos> $AMZN gave me back all the money that I spent on Christmas presents shopping on $AMZN and then some! Shout out to my heroes @SmashTheBid and @SpXpoints for their wisdom. $AAPL also was another good one. #trustthemath/n<neu> @peterfw @NorthmanTrader I think he's still shilling $aapl at 290/n<neg> $aapl has sold out of AirPod pro. People have gone totally panicky and bought up the common stocks in its place. A question though: how do I listen to music with the commen stocks?/n<neu> $AAPL , these calls hit 5.22HOD today SMH , wish I held some/n<neg> $AApl made me money

Missed 32% in $aapl, but guarantee when it pulls back 2% he will say I told you so.  Just pathetic.  Oh yeah missed $100 long in $tsla too in a month.  And this guy gets on TV!/n<neu> $AAPL and $CRUS are only two stock I own right now.

That's tbe real truth $spy $spx $aapl $goog $tsla/n<neg> @AdamNa81 @CGasparino @GerberKawasaki $AAPL makes a lot of profit every year. $TSLA doesn't. So the comparison is wrong.

What am I missing?/n<pos> @GarethSoloway I been tracking this to Gareth AAPL is way up there and still going? Now AMZN is new horse and running hard SPY making a new high to day. Your thoughts on SPY top target are? Thanks Brother as I do love your work!/n<neg> @sindarina (At the same time, it saddens me to read that the global recycling tech market is projected to reach $1.2bn in 2025, approximately one week of AAPL net profits. It seems to scream "so much more could be done" when the entire market is less than 2% of net profits of one player)/n<pos> Good thing I cut my $AAPL position back 20% when it hit $215, NOT!/n<pos> @MadMoneyOnCNBC @jimcramer Without name calling I remember those guys on that show right before yours saying that Apple was probably a good $175 stock. It was around $200 at the time. It just hit $288. Thanks for encouraging us to hold and not trade Aapl./n<pos> Honestly. I think the TRUE key to trading is making targets that you know work with your methods, and stick with those until they hit. Works wonders for me. $spy $spx $goog $aapl $tsla/n<neu> @DougKass @tomkeene Needs to play catch up with Aapl Goog Msft Tsla  I guess, they are all at all time highs Amzn. it's a  Market of new highs,/n<neu> @tofinancialfree $FB was an opportunity before $AAPL was, dropping to the $130s over regulatory concerns. $FDX is an ‚Äúongoing‚Äù panic with everyone concerned that $AMZN will win shipping war. I see it as a solid earner with too many logistics systems (specially international) to just wither away./n<neu> just for giggles take a look at #AAPL weekly RSI pushing 85.....lol....I've seen this before..... we know what happens next when the calendar turns.....we shall see!/n<neg> The day i didn't want to look at $AAPL

I guess not...where is your out?/n<neu> @GarethSoloway @harveypouch @federalreserve Not talking about this week only. The way to play this mkt is from the long side. Many times on $AAPL et al, it's the top, it's the top-nope, it's not. 3% dips then nath in perpetuity. It doesn't matter whether u or i like it. This is the way it will be./n<pos> The technicals are setting in a decent manner

Earnings growth is forecast for the LSDs this yr but is expected to return to ~30% in 2020

It's also badly lagged its peers like $AMZN $AAPL $BABA $MSFT. it's even lagged the $QQQ. So I'm looking at $AMZN as a catch-up trade in '20/n<pos> $M call buyers in there again.  Still going to predict it outperforms $AAPL in 2020.  I believe in mean reversion./n<neu> $AAPL 0.71% less than 3 millon shares.
I must be missing something.../n<neu> I shorted $TSLA with puts once for a quick flip. Every dollar it creeps up is pushing me closer to shorting again. Note: Long term I think #Tesla and @elonmusk are game-changers, and $TSLA at $400 will look like $AAPL at $100 (10 years ago). But consolidation has to happen first./n<neu> @NorthmanTrader $AAPL PEG is above 2 I believe.../n<neu> @sklippitt @pbreit @ValueAnalyst1 @YCalenge So you missed out on AMZN just like me because ‚Äúprinciples‚Äù. What Tssla has over everything is a low cost advantage in battery, powertrain, &amp; data. 

Low cost, high value are the fundamentals of modern day ‚Äúmonopolies‚Äù. (aka AMZN &amp; AAPL)/n<neu> @tofinancialfree I don‚Äôt generally wait for widespread panic. Localized  panic happen every day in the market. I follow a portfolio of about 40 companies, and buy any of them when their stocks experience ‚Äúpanics.‚Äù My best example is buying $AAPL at $160 last year. Other recent examples: $FB, $FDX/n<neg> @osxreverser I always forget what this thing really does and ‚Ä¶ encounter a website for which I need to nuke the cookie ‚Ä¶ and lose all my backlog too üòÑ (has happened at least trice now üòÖ)./n<pos> @258Capital This week I've had friends gloating to me about TSLA &amp; AAPL.

If a correction will not start and general market conditions with trade war progress stay on track.../n<neu> @That1975Bush Last two years i paid for apple products with AAPL fades.../n<neu> I would use any rally into the year end to lighten up on some positions especially the ones like semiconductors biotechs $aapl that have run a lot./n<neg> I don‚Äôt even think the buyers are done yet $AAPL/n<neu> @YoloCapMgmt @a_del_credere I‚Äôm short since some other company will invariably just come up with 7G right after AAPL gets to 6./n<pos> Hate to say this but $AAPL looks very bullish on daily to me. People have been waiting for pullbacks since 240 ish. üòÄ/n<neu> Watchlist 12/26:

$AAPL mike dont short yet wait for your signal/n<neu> @Seabass_says @YahooFinance @AnjKhem You can‚Äôt win em all. $GOOG getting into the space will take some of the scrutiny off $AAPL As far as I‚Äôm concerned $AAPL is the only FAANG stock that‚Äôs not a monopoly and thus shouldn‚Äôt be broken up./n<neg> @Irishoptions76 Yeah - I thought it would have been big in December - but why have institutions selling $aapl and other ATH and pay tax on them this year? It‚Äôs dumb

So they started picking up some of the monsters for 2020 $amzn for example/n<pos> Took a decent hit today on AAPL, biggest red day since October. Ending the month red for the first time ever but it‚Äôs cool. I‚Äôll be back in 2020, stronger than ever. ü§™‚úåüèº/n<pos> I‚Äôve been a member of many trading groups and trade myself scalping AMZN yesterday and AAPL overnight, but @DayTradersGroup made me a better trader and the trader I am. They give you not only amazing trades, but also unheard of instant, amazing support. Ty DTG looking to 2020üöÄüôè/n<neu> ... I wonder if they realize that without the national debt at 23 Trillion, Apple wouldn't be able to see 1000 dollar iphones. $AAPL I know politicians in congress know that. Which is why OMNIBUS is in vogue üòÇ #TrillionDollarDeficitsMakeForGoodSelfies/n<neg> @optionslion8 did you close $shop $aapl at loss?
I hate Friday LoL/n<neu> @BJLoVerde @michaelsantoli @BradHuston It's also worth noting that companies like $AAPL are massive holders of US Treasuries. So instead of invest in there business, they issue investment grade debt, take the cash, buyback stock, and buy treasuries. Which means they feel it a better investment than cap ex. #BuyStonks/n<neu> @Pavel69_B Good question and since I am a much older folk my answer would be a bit safer like an index ETF.   I am not sure that  new ipo or new company in the future like the next aapl or amzn/n<neu> $AAPL - closed 20 cents below 290. If I would have held all day, they would have been worthless. A friendly reminder to take profits when you've got them. If your gut is telling you to get out, do it.

Interesting that $aapl is green but my put option is green too./n<neu> @RaindropsOhMy I would venture that you don‚Äôt even need a negative China üá®üá≥ tweet or anything. At some point there‚Äôs no one left to buy $AAPL , and at some point there‚Äôs enough people that want to book gains. #overbought/n<pos> The 3178 wide gap on $es_f will get filled.

At this point, still expecting continued consolidation  for a couple more days. Not what I wanted out of this play but it's far from over.

 That's what I am doing. Came a little quick but $swks and $aapl  crushed it! Trying to exit $cldr at .20/n<pos> Love these big market correction days. Can really get some of these BIG VALUE NAMES for cheap. 

$AAPL up only 0.5%? Don't mind if I do.

$TSLA DOWN 0.6%? Back up the damn truck./n<neg> I wonder if Mr. Tim is short right now. That filthy vulture. 

$AAPL/n<neg> If today's high in $AAPL is not at least a short-term top, I'm gonna eat my keyboard!/n<neu> @barryb4384 I‚Äôm thinking AMZN for 20%, DIS for 25%, MDP for 25%, CHL for 40%, Baba for 20%, JD for 20%, and NIO for 40% this year! Hope I‚Äôm wrong but see AAPL with 15% pull back. I‚Äôm ready for the stock unit!/n<neg> Revenge traded $AAPL calls, chased with size got greedy and lost big time. Would‚Äôve made a lot of money if I just kept my 290c from Tuesday./n<pos> $TSLAQ I‚Äôm about to start entering short $AAPL; this is the most valuable company in the world trading like a penny stock./n<neu> Interesting $AMZN so underperformed $AAPL and even $GOOG when i view them as the real innovators/n<neg> @Hanakookie1 @DiMartinoBooth @Schuldensuehner It doesn't explain the value proposition.  In March 2000, I think, the value of MSFT exceeded the total market cap of the Toronto exchange.  You're right about the buybacks, but AAPL has doubled in value as its revenue has fallen.  This is unsustainable./n<neg> $AAPL The world's most valuable company doesn't double in value in 1 year after issuing a profit warning. And I agree the company is firing on all cylinders. 

Market bubbles bursting cause unemployment; the Fed is mistaken to not include asset prices when monitoring inflation/n<neu> For me, all the FAANG stocks are short candidates $AMZN $FB $NFLX $AAPL $GOOG $GOOGL/n<neu> King $AAPL seeing Feb 300 calls this AM/n<neu> @PeterTrader99 I did the same with some AAPL 290s expiring today.

I have barely opened my laptop since I got it a few weeks ago./n<neu> @michaelsantoli I wonder if this is partially what is driving the increase in retail investors buying individual stocks as opposed to index ETFs/Funds? Looking for value after choosing bad entry points in 2018 that took 1-1.5 to recover initial investment and seeing AAPL up 70%/n<pos> $AAPL one company I‚Äôll never bet against long term. YTD has +104% change, It‚Äôs continuing to grow AND pays dividends. Perfect example of needing a FAANG stock/n<pos> I bet $AAPL to be the first company to reach $1 trillion market cap 10 years ago. I‚Äôm now betting @elonmusk to be the first trillionaire in 20-30 years. $TSLA $TSLAQ/n<neg> @hmeisler @Yahoo I dont know about stock market, but I know $AAPL is totally a bubble, no innovation, loss in market share everywhere, decreased profit per product ... it is a big surprise how it keeps going up.../n<neu> @Stevema41911913 Something bought far out and far up 

Example

Last December 

$aapl was $140

If you woulda bought 12/2019 $250 calls you would have retired lol

Risky - but big pay 

I‚Äôm not that crazy or OTM though lol/n<pos> @profplum99 @RaoulGMI 1 cent move higher in $AAPL stock "creates" $4,452,485 of "wealth" based on current mkt cap-in other words, 1 person buying 1 share of Apple stock@$289.92 per share makes the combined Apple shareholders positions worth millions more. This mark-up works until people decide to sell/n<pos> @MadMraket My $SNAP and $LK did good.....I needed a little castle so had to take profit only from my $AAPL/n<pos> @thechartist I‚Äôve tested this slightly differently on $SPY &amp; $AAPL and buying the close and selling at open is far more profitable./n<neu> Besides what I already own through $QQQ I also bought some shares of $FB for 3 reasons:
1) Among the mega cap tech cos it is the one that is still growing revenues at the fastest rate.
2) It is also the one that is selling for the lowest consensus forward PE (22.5x like $AAPL)./n<pos> i own best stocks tho aapl/amgn/isrg plus many more market leaders as qrvo/iphi/race or ferrari/iphi/intc/and 25 percent banks!/n<neu> @harley_slamm I‚Äôm just speaking of purely return expectations based off of the base price. If $AAPL were at $220 today and all other variables were equal you would naturally expect a greater return over the next 3-5 years than what you would expect now with the same variables and $290 price/n<pos> @PowerLunch @jpr007 @Tesla @SteveWestly @elonmusk ... except the comparison doesn‚Äôt do justice. All three excelled in vision, engineering, and execution; Musk just more so, especially in scope of vision. (Yes I think TSLA will overtake AAPL in market cap.)

I am looking forward tomorrow looking for a dip rip/n<neu> @markbspiegel It's amusing trading. $fb dropped on ftc news day of china deal up 7% next five sessions. $nflx rallies 12% the next week. $AMZN had been getting faded pops basically 5% in a day week after. They simply all had to catchup to $aapl and $msft. I mean $msft is 30x forward pe now./n<pos> @SqueezeMetrics I knew something was up, the rise in both $AAPL and $AMZN was uncanny today esp at end/n<neg> @ADHDxGamer I feel like $AAPL gaining 600Billion in market cap in 2019 is a bit much. Like when does the (2nd)largest company in the world double in a year?! Parabolic moves like #Apple this year never last that long. Greed will turn into fear, and reversion to the mean is inevitable. #bear/n<neg> @FredDorfDorfman @BomsteinRick I feel like tomorrow will be the top in $AAPL and $SMH and $TSLA and $Msft and $QQQ well the whole F-ING market.

Patience./n<pos> @jbergASU I don‚Äôt care what the earnings shows for $AAPL cause the stock is priced for perfection ST but they will have a monster quarter, the only issue is supply of Air pods vs demand. A good problem to have. U bullish on anything here?/n<neu> @FlyrUsr Personally I feel the current target is DOW 30K at all cost including an interim high for IWM. Once that milestone is achieved markets will start a multi month sell off including AAPL and other overvalued large caps and small caps/n<neu> @hks55 find me anybody wanting to BUY $AAPL at $288/n<neg> @GreekTrader777 Doh!

So for me it‚Äôs been very interesting. I think if $amzn were to do a 1:10 split now they‚Äôd quickly gain 40%. So much retail is just based upon $$ amount for initial purchase./n<pos> @ceribeasto I own plenty of shares of $AAPL./n<neg> So, has  $AAPL and $AMZN goes the market goes higher? I would put $GS too.  I don‚Äôt don‚Äôt like the market short term.  I would be a seller into new highs./n<pos> Good evening! 

$AMZN gapping up 10+ points after hours...This looks like a 1900 magnet tmrw..Strong strong move today.. I haven't seen AMZN move 70+ points in a LONG time.. If we get a day 2 move this can see 1920+

$AAPL if 290 holds, 295,300 coming fast

I bought $AAPL./n<neg> /Much more to discuss but some things are clear: if health systems (as incumbents) don‚Äôt start truly serving us, their consumers: 
1. We will abandon them to those that know how to (i.e., AMZN, WMT, GOOG, AAPL)
2. More will continue to go bankrupt

After those losses I should have taken a bit of time to think. Instead I went straight back. I feel like I over traded during that time/n<neg> Going over my worst market calls this past year &amp; calling that  $AAPL would not reach $1T mkt cap is by far my worst.  Second was $GE I bought at $19 &amp; $8 Other then that I‚Äôve read the mkt spot on./n<neg> @NorthmanTrader NT, would it be safe to say that if AAPL, MSFT, and NFLX will all have a reversion, then the entire Nasdaq will, like March 2000 Dot Com bust?  I remember it so vividly.  Massive layoffs with commercial tech firms, even the bigger ones like G.E./n<pos> @BravoPerez3 @IOHK_Charles Haha thanks.  It seems like a long shot now but if you told me that Aapl stock would be close to $300 a share a few years ago I‚Äôd be like hell that would be cool but seems like a lot. Well it is.

My guess is AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, FB, INTC?/n<neu> @timseymour On @FastMoney, when referring to @AAPL, I thought I heard you debate with @karenfinerman that you liked p/e expansion. Is it okay for an individual stock to re-rate, but not okay for an index that holds a stock that has 3.6% weighting in $SPX?/n<neg> @mattcassinelli I‚Äôm not saying you made a bad choice, just that they‚Äôre a shitty company üòï.

In 2005, I met with execs at Google - 5 of 7 of 'em had Macs. 
Prior to that I knew Apple as a dying brand, but smart Google leaders using Macs was an indicator to me.
I bought AAPL at $9. 
Still holding./n<neg> @BankTheTrade @AjTrader7 Right. The other I called my son AAPL on accident ü§£ü§£ü§£/n<neu> @Ugo_AAPL Bought it two months ago. Also I‚Äôm reusing mine/n<neu> @NorthmanTrader I agree. $aapl is far over extended.  Much of its gains have come on trade tariffs fears ebbing along with ‚Äòsuper cycle‚Äô5G. Over hyped. Long but never added on this run just trimmed and now own under water puts for January/n<neg> @eableson @_MG_ @d3d0c3d Owww. I didn‚Äôt remember these existed üôÇ. 

(Always depends on the threat model, for sure üòÑ)./n<neg> @arthur_eckart Standard deviations now in $AAPL are misleading due to the inverse correlation between price and volatility, and then you have the recent price surges. I see what you mean but I find it has more to do with the bubble our #market is most likely in./n<neg> Playing trans women because we're already dead inside? I'm sure all my AAPL stock./n<pos> I think Feb 21 $AAPL 275 puts serve as a great hedge and it's probably what I'll be entering myself come Monday when we gap up LOL/n<neu> @teslamodel3fan @RobinhoodApp @GerberKawasaki Splitting still assumes someone has $265 to buy one share. I believe the RHApp folks make it so that if you have $50 to invest in TSLA, AAPL, or whatever, you can allocate fractions of the share to buy $50 worth of the stock instead of waiting until you have enough to buy a share/n<neu> $TSLA around $430 a share...
$AAPL around $289 a share...
$AMZN around $1870 a share...

I read about @RobinhoodApp and investing for those that don't use a stock broker and want to purchase in fractional shares, rather than whole shares. I don't use it, but wonder about them./n<neu> I just had one of those Saturday night thoughts...

Imagine everyone who wants to take profits + short $AAPL at $300. 

So to me i think:

A) it‚Äôs about to drop 20 pts from here
B) it races above 300 to 310-320 before 5-10% drop

300 on the dot would be too easy./n<neg> Why is every exclamation on the $AAPL and $AMZN streaming shows I‚Äôm watching ‚ÄúJesus!‚Äù or ‚ÄúJesus Christ!‚Äù It‚Äôs way over done &amp; unrealistic, &amp; it‚Äôs no accident. These R carefully planned &amp; scripted shows, &amp; they promiscuously &amp; flagrantly use the Lord‚Äôs name in vain nonstop.../n<pos> tmr game plan:
$amzn if 1840 holds, potentially bounce to 1860.
$aapl a small dip at open is a blessing. i still hold my position.
$shop watch this closely, it might go 400 tmr.
$msft a drop back to 156.5, loading zone.
$es_f just throw money in, it will reverse. lol./n<neg> @WideCover hahaha I don't get the window dressing side of things.. how can no one be able to know entry pt? if the fund underperformed benchmark, and then it shows its overweight AAPL, how does that even make sense/n<pos> @RealTianZeng I totally agree. The buyback policy has a huge influence on the (analytical) approach investors take wrt $AAPL.  The cash reserves back up the case... I assume as long as it continues to grow./n<neu> @bootsiejones 1% dvd yield man, the only argument  i can see is the buy back plus large cash pile - at this pt the thesis is it goes up because it goes up everyday so you always buy aapl (and not the like of amzn) - i also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs and underweight name... it‚Äôs 1.3 trillion mkt cap/n<pos> @RealTianZeng I think traders are using their cash reserves as a flight to quality. The ‚Äúmust hold $AAPL‚Äô school of thought also gets a yield better than anything on short or medium term bonds./n<neg> @TradeWithNinja They tried to make me dump my $AAPL position early on but I am not that guy anymore./n<pos> @justbrosef I was too cool - I owned $AAPL when only the BAWs were interested and when it underperformed, selling it when it got popular./n<neg> I hope bulls haven't pinned their hopes on $aapl carrying this market, bc Huawei is going to eat their lunch./n<pos> @TradeAZmade For me the 2019 earners were AAPL, CSL, XRO. 10 bagger A2M steady, thank god Jetstar Jayne is gone üòÄ/n<pos> That was a weak close...

Elephant in the room is Apple‚Äôs podcast app is the default, will be incredibly hard to overcome...could be excellent acquisition for either AAPL or AMZN./n<neg> There is nothing here that is hard for me Andy but why won't you admit that you said "AAPL stock will continue to struggle well into the first half of 2019."???? WHY Andy WHY??/n<neu> @alamentarius It‚Äôs not a trade for me. It‚Äôs an accumulate/strategy. It‚Äôs definitely different than a trade in $aapl or $amzn or $tsla. It‚Äôs a thesis. That might be right or wrong.   I bought knowing if have to give room to buy more./n<pos> Surprised I don't see more people bragging about their 100% 1 year gain in obscure, under-followed $AAPL./n<neu> They talking bout the holidays ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I been told ppl about AAPL/n<pos> @pulte Great idea: I'd like some AAPL please!/n<pos> $AAPL price action today was very impressive.

Shame I didn't have the money to buy more./n<pos> Today I pointed out great calls from weekend analysis. $WMT slight loser and $BA, as mentioned. Rest were on point.

Made money in the portfolio, and now I'm calling it a day. üëçüìà/n<neu> I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and say that I am one of those people who bot $AAPL when is crossed back and held 289.

Up around a 100% since January and Bullishness is still soaring through the roof.
 Wow!
 Has the market changed from the old days./n<neg> Extreme Extreme Extreme Bullishness on $AAPL.
Most of all time.

Any flaws in this logic?/n<pos> @ThadMcMonster Yeah, think that's fair. It helps that I like the bank investments a lot. AAPL is a good example of where I think the look through position size matters more, especially since I do not personally think that's a good investment at ~$300 per share./n<neu> @TSOH_Investing Fair enough. Personally, given that BRKs entire bank portfolio is about a fifth of its mkt cap it does impact my limit on how much I'd invest in banks. (Though I'm nowhere near that limit).

 Useless to put price targets on stocks.
 Like I was so Bullish on $AAPL and was thinking that the Parabolic move higher goes to $275-80.
 That was a joke
 #AAPL blew right through that/n<pos> $AAPL I know all you Apple fans are looking for the 2020 best medical device company today!! Here it is!!!! $PAVM/n<neg> @tyutchev Doesn't exonerate faulty analytics.

Lessons were learned about volatility, not selling puts against stocks unless you are ready to own them &amp; not trying to fix the problem overnight./n<neu> @pmc10000 @StockCharts ‚õìÔ∏è

Did they fix #UserDefinedIndexes?

How long did it take?

I'd like to add AAPL (long) &amp; -QQQ (short)
Is it possible? Will it issue the resulting chart?

Thanxü§ù 

#ainafinüìàüìâ/n<pos> Looked at charts for an hour and a half, now off to bed. I posted my chart notes on @TAtradesPrivate - a lot of good names I am watching tomorrow. DM me if you have any questions regarding my trading service!

I like the technical setup here. The other three charts are nice. $AAPL and $MSFT both lovely trending up. $GOOGL too just a little more choppy. $AMZN above the recent highs around 1825. Last candle kept the low above the 200 SMA only 4* from Morningstar must be winner/n<pos> üí°Given the performance of $AAPL this year there have to me a decent number of consumers of @Apple that MADE more from the stock in the past year than they SPENT on @Apple products

You made me do the math...AAAHHHHHH!!!!!/n<pos> @areitu Sorry about your ex - 2005 would probably do for me (AAPL: $10, GOOG: $100) But, being in a somewhat happy spot now, its hard to look at anything that's happened or I've learned or people I've met and not see it as part of the journey to the happiness I have now. Happy 2020!! =)/n<pos> @gwestr I started started AAPL in 2006 w/serious loadup starting 2007. Been a great thing. As has $TSLA. Were you in the market for the 2008 crash? If not, then you're in no position to give us history lessons

You missed this entire run-up didn't you? Is that what peed in your Cheerios?/n<neg> A day of paper cuts, small wins, &amp; small losses. Meh. I would've been better off sleeping.

THERE WERE SHREDS BRO!/n<pos> So, I bought one $AAPL share on October 24th; and it‚Äôs currently +20%. Absolutely insane return for such a short time period./n<neu> I don't mean to close on a negative note here, but I do think it's important to hammer home the idea that all equities, even the very best ones, carry risks. Apple is no different. $AAPL/n<pos> it's important to note that this stock has experienced its fair share of dips during the last few years and if I had to guess, patient investors looking to get long AAPL will probably be rewarded sometime in the relatively near future.

$AAPL/n<neu> However, chasing momentum is a dangerous practice in my eyes and although I think it's definitely possible that AAPL continues to produce performance relative to the broader markets, $AAPL/n<pos> I'm certainly thankful that I was brave enough to buy AAPL when it was relatively unloved, but I imagine that there are others feeling a bit of FOMO (fear of missing out) when it comes to Apple's run over the last 12 months if they feel underinvested in the name. $AAPL/n<neg> To me, today's elevated multiple results in a thin margin of safety and I'm not interested in adding to AAPL at these levels, double digit CAGR potential or not. Simply put, to me, buying shares when the multiple is at a 10-year high, seems akin to chasing momentum. $AAPL/n<neu> Do I expect to see AAPL shares sell off 20% or more in 2020? No. If I did, I wouldn't own so many shares (generally speaking, I acknowledge that my fair value multiple targets are generally more conservative than the broader market's). $AAPL/n<neg> Personally, I think the 18-20x area makes sense as far as a fair value multiple goes for Apple. Placing a 19x multiple on AAPL's ttm EPS results in a $225 price target, using this estimate. This represents potential downside of roughly 20%. Once again, significant downside.
$AAPL/n<neu> Apple's average P/E ratio over the last decade is just 15.5x. While I think this multiple is low due to irrational pricing for most of the first half of the 2010s, $AAPL/n<pos> And, with that in mind, I want to make it clear that I'm not here to say that their 25-30x multiples are necessarily going to be the new normal for the best-in-breed big tech names such as Apple.
$AAPL/n<neu> Conclusion

I say it could in italics for good reason. Although 2019 might have us believing otherwise, stocks do not usually go up in a straight line. They go down sometimes. Mean reversion is real. $AAPL/n<pos> and I think the EPS growth plus the dividend and continued (slight) multiple contraction could result in a double digit CAGR moving forward from here.

$AAPL/n<neu> If AAPL is able to hit market expectations for low double digit bottom-line growth expectations moving forward, I see no reason why the multiple would need to contract $AAPL/n<pos> Moving forward, I think that AAPL shares will begin to follow the fundamentals again. They'll trade up and down alongside EPS performance. And you know what, that's not a terrible thing. $AAPL/n<neu> I think it's clear that another year driven purely by multiple expansion like this is unlikely. Barring a catastrophic sell-off, I doubt we'll see AAPL provide ~100% returns over any 12-month period once the December 2018 dip is no longer being used in comparisons. $AAPL/n<neu> But, I do think upside is pretty limited past that ~30x range because, at the end of the day, it's still going to be awhile before hardware sales stop dominating AAPL's quarterly results./n<neu> Could shares rise up to 25x? Sure. 30x? Why not? Microsoft (MSFT) is trading for roughly 31x right now and although I don't think that AAPL has anything product/service that can rival the growth of MSFT's cloud operations at the moment,/n<pos> It's about AAPL and while AAPL's multiple has also experienced significant expansion over the last year or so, I think this company's valuation could still have some room to run before things get really frothy./n<pos> In this piece, I'll be looking at Apple (AAPL) through this 12-month lens. Apple is by far my largest holding and probably the company that I pay the most attention to (due to the fact that AAPL shares make up roughly 10% of my holdings)./n<pos> Moving forward, I think AAPL has the potential to provide investors with a double digit CAGR./n<pos> What A Difference A Year Makes For Apple

AAPL shares are up roughly 100% during the trailing twelve months./n<pos> $aapl above $300? wtf?

Personally I don‚Äôt think so. The swing target stays at 3300 which is the first reasonable turning point on big timeframes/n<neg> I think the internet is broken because it keeps telling me /ES futures are down.

$AAPL gapped up 1 AH..looks primed for 303-305 nxt.  I'm eyeing the 302.5C 

$AMZN if it can hold over 1900 it can see 1925-1950 

$BIDU started to fill the gap to 150 ,134 was the key resistance lvl

$SPX finally broke 3250, it can see 3270 nxt

Good luck tmrw!/n<neu> @TwinsightPro I sold everything today b4 close just to be safe also time decay.

Sounds like the potential for brand dilution imo. If I am going to buy Apple stock, I want AAPL, or better yet - Apple. Not some random string of numbers./n<neg> The investment brokers have been pushing me to trim my exposure in $aapl because it‚Äôs a huge part of my portfolio. But why would I punish a company for doing so well? I don‚Äôt sell market beaters because they beat the market! Re-balancing is a rule I can break.

@DavidGFool/n<pos> @BYoung001 @ValueAnalyst1 AAPL has split in multiple times, not to long ago a 7to1 and investors love it. I know I did even if it doesn't mean anything.  If $tsla would split , you can be sure thousands of small investors would call their brokerage and buy shares they would not at 450$ and that's great/n<pos> @dtellom Not sure I trust the price change, but maybe the market is understanding $AAPL finally.

I sold around the same time you did because I didn‚Äôt think it would go anywhere but I wouldn‚Äôt have held for 20 years so it‚Äôs alright/n<neu> @ballmatthew Super long AAPL but mainly for payment processing. I think they're in the streaming space as a place holder mainly to weaken one of the other competitors enough to buy them out./n<pos> @zzbar @asymco Don‚Äôt forget that is $96/share position in 2009 is before the 7:1 split. So that‚Äôs $13.70 in today‚Äôs basis. Of course, I bought 100s AAPL in 2002 for 17, &amp; sold it 2yrs later for 60. Thought I did great! But that 100 shares is 1400 shares today, worth $416,000 today! If only!/n<neu> @jimcramer I'm still holding a boatload of AAPL @ 8 (after the 7-1 split)...AMZN @ 142...GOOG @ 138...and FB @ 30.

Most of my holdings were US based mega-caps ( $AAPL, $MSFT, $FB, $MA, $V) with most of balance held in US index ETFs. Although several mid-caps were bought ¬£SCT, ¬£OXIG, ¬£TMG early in Q1. 2/n/n<neg> @rationalwalk @alexandermearle I had similar investing genius moments with AAPL. Looking back on it, I am beginning to doubt my ‚Äúgenius‚Äù part./n<neg> What if I told you $AAPL will lose at least $45 from their share price in the next 45 days/n<neu> Aapl is such a terrifyingly massive company, I saw somewhere AirPods alone could be the 32nd largest US market cap lol/n<pos> @OphirGottlieb $AAPL is one of the few buy &amp; hold stocks I have. It's even in a separate account to keep it off my mind. 

Now my second-largest position as a result. certainly did not start out at No. 2./n<neu> @BretKenwell I wrote about it in 2016 for CML Pro. Even showed an exact example of MSFT revenue dipping but stock price ripping bc revenue turned into recurring. My AAPL thesis 4 years ago is exactly the stock it is today./n<neu> If AAPL doesn't hit a $1Trillion MKTcap, I will personally pay off your mortgage! #ThingsStockBrokersSay/n<neu> If you want TA done on a stock for you follow me then comment the stock ticker and I will break it down for you tomorrow $SPY $AAPL $GLD $TSLA $FB $NFLX $MCD $SNAP $DIS $SHOP $UBER $QQQ/n<neu> A lot of downgrades hitting $AAPL this weekend.

AAPL inveiling their chips and stop using Intels?  I might need to dump my Intel calls./n<neg> And to sum up $AAPL... The reality is you aren‚Äôt able to time the market. If you look down and say the market is at record highs, I won‚Äôt put money in the market now. Over time you miss more opportunities than you save by trying to time the market./n<neg> What happened? Why is number of iPhones not being reported? I said I would not sell $AAPL Guess what?/n<neu> @Hipster_Trader And he owns about 1 million shares of $AAPL that were given to him as compensation, so his buybacks upped their value by $100M this year. I wonder how different Apple would be run if he didn't have those shares and were only bonused on revenue and profit./n<neg> @charliebilello What I remember is @ScottWapnerCNBC freaking out on @CNBCFastMoney like the world was coming to an end and $AAPL would never sell another iPhone in China.  And I'm thinking, "does he not realize how much money my kids spend on iTunes every single week of the year?"/n<neu> @thirdrowtesla I'm holding #TSLA and will add more on each 10% dip to my 161 $TSLA worth $71K now until $TSLA is worth more than $AAPL in 10-15 years.

I am bearish on AAPL, and will look to short at any price above 298, unless stock corrects 5%/n<pos> @BrianVCaffrey @OphirGottlieb The hardest thing for me to assess re NVTA is the caliber of management. Great companies, like AMZN or AAPL or NVDA, are led by brilliant, ambitious people at the top, with a clear LT vision. I‚Äôm hoping that‚Äôs the case with NVTA, but haven‚Äôt followed them long enough to gauge.../n<pos> @DougKass @hmeisler @michaelsantoli I agree totally... CNBC pumps AAPL all day long. Not one negative comment. Nada!/n<neu> @FlyrUsr But for car companies giving AAPL the self driving OS foothold is like opening up their ecosystem such that they become an assembler like Foxconn. Then AAPL might dictate how a car should look and the road feel. Why would a BMW or an Audi or Mercedes want that kind of control?/n<pos> @cherry13474475 NKE $101.92 it‚Äôs nice if you like watching paint dry. It moves to slow for me personally, new CEO. Okay for long term. What‚Äôs the catalyst for the stock moving higher? AAPL has wearables watches, air-buds and a buzz people lineup to buy products it up $125 since 3jun19/n<neu> @rationalwalk From your purchase date of AAPL through today, SPX 278%, INTC 207%, CSCO 166%, QCOM 290%, IBM 90%, ORCL 261%, MSFT 756%, BRK/B 377% (trust me, you don't want to see AAPL).  Keep in mind, AAPL had another 30% drawdown from your sale date./n<neu> $spx $spy My concern about "buy the dip" thesis is we remain near ATH and significantly overbought. I'm currently short equity $aapl with average above $299 and holding 320 puts on $spy in case of ME escalation over the weekend./n<neu> Taking the night off of charts - I will be reviewing daily and weekly charts this weekend.

Are you ready?/n<pos> @Maximo_thoughts @tekmunnee I focused on TSLA, AAPL, and AMD today with a hint of INPX swing overnight and out near open.  Market action gap down was us/Iran related.... @tekmunnee will take good care of you./n<neu> @niftyistrog i bought aapl for $280 üò≥/n<neu> @peter90402 @asymco I think that was a myth created by Icahn.  He, indeed, tried to pressure AAPL to repurchase more shares - but Cooke politely ignored him and continued the repurchases as they had already planned them./n<pos> @PythiaR I sold someone 5 shares today. These proceeds plus two Tesla share sales will fund my new Apple desktop. Thanks $AAPL and $TSLA/n<neu> I hear all the time about teaching.  Let me ask you this: how many from a room learned enough where they now trade on there own? $spy $spx $aapl $goog $tsla $amzn. #foolsgold/n<neu> RY up 276% during the same period, AAPL up 1400%, Semis up 142%, LULU up 3,214%, NFLX up 3150%, SBUX up 780%, CP Rail up 678%, MCD up 234%, TLSA up 2115%, AMZN 2030%, etc. etc...so, I ask you this: Will Friday's missile strike change all that?  ü§î/n<pos> $SPY $TVIX $AAPL 

   I like it, more upside during open hours leading into the week after. Controlled gap down but the hourly is still rising./n<neu> @TrendSpider @seyedoption How would you determine what is a good strike, exp, and cost on a call option to buy?  We can use DIS or AAPL as an example.  I am trying to learn how to buy call options.  TIA/n<neu> Charts and coffee tonight! Will likely be around 10 pm or 11 pm EST.

This week should be fun for those who like to do more than just buy $AAPL and $SPY into ATHs./n<neu> @BlogJulianKomar Problem is, even then, it's a long shot of getting in the right company. I literally had a Sandisk mp3 player before/when ipod came out. Did same exact thing and cheaper. Never would've guessed ipod would kickstart AAPL to top dog/n<neu> @NorthmanTrader Sold $AAPL over the summer, for modest gains (~35% to 50%).

I (quickly) calculated an intrinsic value (#stickerprice) of ~ $165, with MOS (#marginofsafety) below $82.50.

Although i cant be too disappointed as i bought $AAPL instead and enjoying triple digit gains. Should have bough both!/n<neg> @NorthmanTrader I think GS is a bunch of overvalued idiot analysts who are doing guess work. Didn't they say the other day that there is not much risk in the market57? If aapl goes - 35% the market will be down 30% so in a sense they are hedging their bets and that is how they are always right./n<neu> @MarkDampier @iancowie Personally I think Philip Morris #PM is a lousy investment.  It is the third largest position in the Fundsmith Equity Fund.  A classic case of quality without growth.  A risky proposition due to the transition towards vaping.  Apple #AAPL is a much better stock and company IMO./n<pos> #Stocks visible on published graphs:

First shares were purchased early 2019 with $5K refund from Tesla on the Model 3 Performance. Figured I'd just invest it in $TSLA and let it ride... Then I started really digging into the company since I had a vested interest. Swapped my AAPL &amp; F for $TSLA in May/June./n<neg> @jjhanna2 @ValueAnalyst1 I don't think there's any wrong decision made here. You had your gain, you dont think it's worth as much anymore, you sell and shift to $TSLA, great process. $AAPL's share price is none of your biz anymore, just like if you divorce your wife, she's not your biz anymore./n<neg> @jjhanna2 @1stPrincipleInv If you were a patron, you wouldn't have... In response to a Patron request, I published an AAPL article right around the bottom, indicating that it was deeply undervalued./n<pos> @1stPrincipleInv @ValueAnalyst1 I have to admit, I sold $AAPL a couple years ago because I thought their iPhone sales peaked, no new compelling products coming out, and Pixel came out and people loved them.  I no longer believed in Apple but they are up 50% since then. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neg> @ivanhodiny @TicTocTick But you are correct that they are both strategies you could use if you believe a stock is going to fall. Selling calls is fairly typical for people looking to monetise their stock holdings. Can also be risky and short sighted. I lost a ton of upside on AAPL &amp; FB doing this./n<pos> We had 3 trades last week over at @TAtradesPrivate that exceeded 100% profit:

Raise you hands...no?/n<pos> @jimcramer If you live to be 100, your best advice will always have been to own AAPL not trade it. By listening to your advice, you have made me and a lot of other people a ton of $$$ and financial independence. Thanks Cramer/n<neu> @pragmatictake @BYoung001 @ValueAnalyst1 I had friends that would not touch aapl at 700 because it was too expensive, they bought later when it split. Multiply that by thousands and you have significant demand of shares that were not there before. It has to be worth something/n<neg> Right or wrong, I don't believe news makes a difference.

AAPL is one of the FANG stocks. Just one of the FANGs is enough to sway the SPY index. A Call or Put on the SPY allows you to capture profit from the price action on AAPL.

In my case, if I sell half (at a profit mind you) then I still have a significant exposure. In the case of AAPL, better to have $1M + $5k than $10K./n<neu> $CEI  Lower low

The highlighted section in my screenshot clearly points out underexposure is the key variable.

Anecdotal and maybe nothing, but interesting nonetheless. 

Oh, and has 60k of her 100 on $AAPL./n<neu> @neilcybart @AboveAvalon Here‚Äôs a corollary:
If active investors add exposure, then AAPL market cap increases. This causes SPY to have a greater weighting than 4.3% AAPL (I think, due to rebalancing). 
This results in a ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù loop continuously increasing the value of AAPL.

What stops this process??/n<neg> @ValueAnalyst1 @Tesla i bought 200 shares of AAPL at 12.95 after 2001 ($2600). and sold it a few months later. who would have thought? NEVER sell good stocks. it would be $840,000 today plus dividends. Big regret!/n<pos> @littlesteve I can‚Äôt wait for the next episodes of that adventure üôÇ./n<neg> @uk_domain_names Every now and again I do the math to torture myself.

Apple has split 3 times since: 100 x 2 x 2 x 7= 2800 shares. Currently AAPL is a bit over $300. 2800 x 300 is around $840,000.

So yeah, pretty expensive tech mistake./n<neg> @uk_domain_names In 2001 I had a spare $1000 and was tossing up between a video camera and 100 shares of AAPL. Turned out to be the most costly camera anyone ever bought./n<neg> @caro_milanesi Ehhhhh, people really are rude.

IF (IF) we had a 3% pullback on the general market this week (i said IF get over it)

-30% in 2 months

Then they double their stock price hahahha

Seems like they are hiding something - if the numbers were great they would throw it in our faces no?/n<neg> @ElectricJen I understand that stocks and $TSLA in particular can be a daunting experience. TSLA is very manipulated so it can go down almost as quickly as it has gone up. I had similar with $AAPL for 20 years. Not something to put money one can't afford to lose. At least you have your Teslas/n<neu> I'd say this is the melt up. $Tsla $aapl tells the story./n<neu> @aksjefokus I think $swks stock should be a 1000 bagger and maybe worth as much as $aapl, stay the course......kidding obviously/n<pos> AAPL is trading 92% above its 200-week moving average and 42% above its 200-day moving average. 

Beginning of 2006, End of 2007, April &amp; Sept of 2012, and Sept of 2018 look similar to me. The stock came back down to its 200wma in each prior instance./n<neu> Just got off the phone with a friend who said he was going to short $AAPL. I actually was patient and asked based on what. After he rambled about technical mumbo jumbo I said, it hasn't had but one, three down day set in three months. Until it does no. Top pickers get burned...../n<neu> @tim_cook Great, but would Steve approve or relentlessly develop more into it? Please get back to me on this. What's Mike Markkula doing these days? Wholly #ACM Aviation? #aapl/n<neg> @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC What do I do with the stock that ate my portfolio? $AAPL started as a reasonable %, but has now grown to 30% of my account. Hate to sell any, but also don't like heavy concentration. What to do?/n<neu> @FUTURENEWS2020 I tend to think that we should undercut the Dec 2018 lows by this fall. And the carnage in the tech bubble stocks from these heights will be massive even at SPX 2,200 or whatever. I'm waiting to buy one year puts on AAPL and SPY./n<neg> @CNBCFastMoney Saying AAPL is a Sell on Oct 6 when it was 227 (and repeating the Sell call) all the way up to 310, thank goodness I did not listen to this DUMB call (using his words) and did  NOT sell my AAPL, which would have been DUMB, facts are facts/n<pos> My best trade last year was during $AAPL event when they announced Apple TV Subscription - I immediately shorted Netflix 4 days. Second was when New Tarriffs were announced and I bought $gld $140 calls. Moral of the story you can make more money from waiting for events then b&amp;h./n<neu> I think what you do with tesla depends on your overall allocation &amp; age. IE. I bought 1000 shares of apple in 2003, i think at $30. I dont want to know what they would be worth today with splits... I still have 220 shares I kept and took a lot of profit but... $TSLA $AAPL/n<neu> @thejarius I felt the same way about $AAPL when they informed investors they wouldn't reveal iPhone sales anymore stock dropped to like $150 now it's past $300 lol.

It's  true and I remember the fear. Heck, people thought $TSLA was doomed just a few months ago, and that's when we were able to sneak in and buy it at less than half today's quote./n<neu> What'd I miss? Is $tsla buying $dpz because of the synergies of robotaxis delivering over 500 million pizzas/yr?  Or is $aapl finally buying Tesla before it gets too expensive?/n<neu> Pretty obvious to say but I won‚Äôt have $tsla $bynd or $aapl on my Pivot watch for tomorrow.  Some better value out there .

One thing that I'm watching for is a melt up of bullish action which I feel like is sort of seen in stocks like $TSLA and $AAPL but not necessarily in the broader market./n<neg> It‚Äôs time, I think.

So they will announce their sales increased by 30% last quarter, right?/n<neu> @8XD23 Except for the daily $AAPL upgrade I couldn't figure out any other catalyst.  Currencies supportive, but not sure, beyond just consensus wanting 3300./n<neg> @Liu3chiang @josecorai I sold 10,000 shares of $AAPL at $180 (realizing a massive LTCG) and used all proceeds to by POS $TWTR.

Short now?
It will almost certainly be done tomorrow.
All I know is...I tried to short it for 40 points...then I gave up. Its much better when you give in and take the run./n<pos> We feel confident $AAPL is very likely to test $300 after a near-term trip to $330 and there's opportunity to make 10-15% on the trade over the near-term./n<neg> @RyRy_Carr I don‚Äôt want to be real long at all

Clearly a winner over multiple time periods.

But where it is priced TODAY, is it a superior R:R proposition?

Assigning odds is very hard./n<neu> I once held a very large position in $AAPL with a cost basis of 103 and sold it at 114 - one of my biggest regrets and yet something that taught me very much/n<neu> if there's one thing i wish i'd started earlier in my career, it would be investing in the stock market. as soon as you have enough income to spare some extra cash for the stock market, DO IT and leave it for years. i started in 2007 and first bought $aapl stock. i retired at 36!/n<pos> $TSLA is to cars what $AAPL is to computers. I've made it known I love the stock long term but I'm almost ready to buy short-term put options again. It needs to simmer down a bit. $TSLA's market cap is already larger than $F's at its peak.

Options strength still is in overall stock minus ETF‚Äôs 

Options on Etf‚Äôs still massive hedging going on. Not very many are talking about this.
This is what is to me driving the market higher as well. $SPY/n<neu> @jimcramer I assume you saw the Barrons this week and the discussion of lightening up on AAPL with high valuations now.

HOW in hell can we talk about $aapl be as good as it gets when ANALysts are putting price targets of $6,000 on Tesla??

The year was 2000 and in a matter of just a few days at the end of September the price went from 50 to 25 or so. I was pretty sure they'd bounce back./n<neg> @ElaineBenes99 LOL nope.‚Ä¶. but I hear if you use a $AAPL phone and eat fake meat it does..../n<neg> @MotleyFoolSG /5 #thread $AAPL $CRUS

With documented YoY and QoQ revenue declines, Cirrus has *still* exploded to ~$85/sh.  Cirrus does not have the broad shoulders of Apple and the removal of the "dongle" from iPhones has hurt them. I will short Cirrus at an opportune moment.

Seems to me same story here and likely same outcome./n<neu> @MindMakesMatter Short answer is "yes", but I prefer $CGC
You have to recognize that it's a crap can, everyone hates it...it's not $AAPL. Analysts downgrade it weekly.

Today, $AAPL added ~$17 Billion in value. In just one day. ü§Ø/n<neu> Method 1 - Historical Trends. This is very simple. I asked the question, "What is the average annual increase in dividends over the past seven years when Apple was buying shares?" $AAPL/n<neu> Calculation of the Dividend Per Share in FY 2022
I wanted to find simple ways to estimate future dividends. I came up with two ways to do this. The first way used historical trends and projected out. $AAPL/n<pos> Based on this I was able to estimate that Apple is still worth $400 per share by FY 2022. That is at least one-third higher than today. $AAPL/n<pos> I especially wanted to estimate Apple's huge buyback program. I wanted to see what effect it has on dividend payments over the next three fiscal years. $AAPL/n<neu> I felt that my model might have been a little too complicated. I wanted to simplify it a bit. So I took out a number of scenarios and decided to predict what would happen if the present trends simply continued. $AAPL/n<pos> At the time I predicted that AAPL stock was worth $302.13. Apple stock is almost there right now at about $300 per share.

$AAPL/n<pos> Updating My Model on Apple Stock Based on Its Buybacks
I wanted to update my model on Apple (AAPL) stock from the article I wrote on August 7, 2019, "Apple's 8% Total Yield Will Push the Stock Higher." $AAPL/n<pos> I estimate that by FY 2022, in a little less than three years, the dividend per share will be $4.00, based on its huge buybacks.
$AAPL/n<pos> Summary
I wanted to update my model from the previous article I wrote on Apple in August.

Based on my cash flow and buyback estimates, which will lead to higher dividends per share, Apple will be worth significantly more in the next three years.
$AAPL/n<neu> For these examples, I have assumed you own 200 shares and can tolerate a decline of 20%, but not one larger than that. I've circled the cost as a percentage of position value below to distinguish it from the annualized cost as a percentage of position value. $AAPL/n<neu> In Case I'm Wrong About Apple
In the event I'm wrong about Apple, and the stock declines significantly over the next several months, here are two ways you can protect yourself. $AAPL/n<neu> These columns refer to changes we made in my system's security selection process in November, ones I detailed in a previous article ("Finding Alpha In Security Selection"). $AAPL/n<neg> Why I Am "Very Bullish" on Apple Now
Apple was ranked a bit lower in my system last Friday (January 3rd) than it was back in July: #87 out of the 1,757 securities that passed the preliminary securities then. Here's my system's current analysis of Apple.
$AAPL/n<neu> Readers may note that I didn't mention any fundamentals on Apple above. My system doesn't consider fundamentals directly, as its metrics need to apply to all securities with options traded in the U.S., $AAPL/n<pos> After subtracting the cost of hedging, Apple was ranked #53 among the 2,122 securities that passed my system's two preliminary screens on July 8th. That's why I gave Apple a "very bullish" rating then.

$AAPL/n<pos> In this case, it was possible to hedge Apple that way, so there was no need to lower the number to find an optimal collar (i.e., there was no need to drop the cap).
$AAPL/n<pos> Last July, as a result of its analysis on Apple (AAPL), it estimated a potential return for the stock of about 33% over the next 6 months, as I noted in an article here at the time. Instead, Apple shares have returned nearly 50% since. $AAPL/n<pos> My system is "very bullish" on Apple again now. I explain why.

I also present ways you can limit your downside risk in the event my system is wrong this time. $AAPL/n<pos> The company will have to report very strong results to keep this rally going, and management will have to determine whether or not buying back a large number of shares at these prices makes sense. $AAPL/n<neu> Stocks rigged to the upside. AAPL literally up over 110% in the last year with flat 2%+ revenue. Indexes up 40%+ on flat earnings in 2019. A country with unsustainable debt and a president getting impeached. I guess who cares? Buy buy! @SquawkCNBC @jimcramer @SquawkStreet/n<neu> I put together the following table to show you where things looked a year ago versus where they are now in terms of possible repurchases and how there could be a major impact. $AAPL/n<pos> Finally, as I discussed in my latest article on Apple, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet increase into year's end has sent US markets across the board sharply higher.

All the complaints I‚Äôve seen blame the app.

I‚Äôm not saying all deserve to re-rate but surely some are diamonds in the rough.

We'd be living in the year 2050 right now, technology-wise, if he were still alive. $AAPL/n<pos> @EminiVolume @EddyElfenbein I actually prefer to scalp the /NQ versus the /ES and one of the main reasons why is because watching stocks like AAPL NFLX and AMZN throughout the day in relation to the /NQ give a good confirmation non confirmation of the daily ‚Äúrhythm‚Äù of intra movement of the /NQ/n<neu> @ballarina_ @BigBankOus @theCoDubya I know what you mean, I know a lot of people that swing $AAPL constantly/n<neu> @Hipster_Trader I expect $NFLX to double in 12 months. Why? When they are facing reporting negative subs they‚Äôll stop reporting the new subscribers # just like $AAPL took off when they stopped reporting slowing iphone sales./n<pos> @David_Kretzmann Amzn, pypl, goog, nflx, AAPL, CRM, INTC, adsk, fb, msft, iq, Meli, shop, baba, dis ... This was a fun exercise.  I didn't even know my top 15 holdings üòÇ/n<neu> @greenycapital I wouldn't be surprised if we see bundles emerge.

Those same people missed MSFT, AMZN, NTFX, GOOG, AAPL, etc.

I understand the profit argument but it is short sighted.

Besides, only invest what you can stand to lose./n<neu> $NFLX missed the US subscriber estimates by 200k(!!). Also note that Netflix guided down fairly significantly for Q1. Will $DIS flat-out replace $NFLX? Unlikely. However, $NFLX is starting to feel the heat‚Äîwith $DIS, $AMZN, $AAPL and others on the way./n<neu> @JoshManMode I sold my iPhone for more aapl stocks based on this tweet./n<pos> Wouldn‚Äôt be thrilled if I were a $nflx investor tonight but I expect the call to be centered around $dis and $aapl and Reed gives good answers. Stock rebounding AH now, could drift up as more earnings come out and turn if $qqq does.

My desired outcome given my $spy 1/29 calls/n<neu> @ReformedBroker I see your ‚Äúthat to my‚Äù transition and up you to when they request to ‚Äúexclude AAPL or xyz‚Äù from the review because anyone could‚Äôve made that call... hearing that amongst some advisor types. So when they fall on their face like a Patriot QB... who owns it then? Winter is coming../n<neu> @SimpleDayTrader @ripster47 I honestly don‚Äôt know, I figured this quarter would‚Äôve been down slightly while people figured out $AAPL $DIS services but would wind up back to $NFLX so it‚Äôs literally a crap shoot between streaming services at this point, original content is where $NFLX shines though/n<neu> @jimcramer I have never taken profits on several stocks that have over 100% returns. (AAPL, CI, ABBV, INTC). Should I take out the full amount of my initial investment now, take 20-25% in increments over several months, or hold?/n<neu> $AAPL

Being an investor and not a trader is what makes me not care about the exact bottom. It very well could go down more but I‚Äôll collect the dividend and enjoy the eventual return to all time highs. Did the same with AAPL &amp; SBUX./n<neu> @CAVandy @hassankhan big believer is more RAM over faster processor but also depends on what you do? for basic desktop stuff, more RAM almost always better. i build a new PC every 5 to 7 years so not that smart on Mac configs. why not offload iTunes data to AAPL music?/n<neg> @joe_ders @phoenixvalue Hmm that's an interesting question. I think an idiot could run $GOOG and $FB and they would still succeed. $AMZN, $NFLX, $AAPL and I'll throw in $MSFT are all probably management dependent. We saw an idiot run $MSFT and they did not do so well haha./n<neu> @Appaholik I think the new part is that AAPL has ways 2 enable an opt-in for users 2 pre-internet fail-secure encrypt backups.  Headline clickbait is "CAUSE FBI", but it's probably additional reasons too.  Setting default to "fail-safe" is defensible, refusing to offer option seems shady./n<pos> @michaelsantoli thank you!!!!  Last week I felt compelled to write that AAPL's stock looked nothing like charts from 1999./n<neg> @HedgeyeComm Solid companies miss earnings and I am a believer of letting  market hype screw up the prices (in this case, hype on $DIS and $AAPL)./n<neg> Which broker(s)/platform(s) NOT allowing people to sell???

I‚Äôm sure I like many would be happy to give you a cut of any awards for such a service, talk about brand value &amp; that would be a real service to society./n<neu> Not that this will bother $AAPL and its valuation a lot. 

They have so much cash that a poor streaming service and future write-downs won‚Äôt hurt them a lot - it‚Äôs just odd for a company making so few strategic mistakes (the luxury gold Apple Watch was the last one I remember)./n<neg> Disney, Amazon, Sky, Netflix, Apple, HBO and what not..

What some analysts don‚Äôt seem to understand is that pirates will win again if there isn‚Äôt consolidation. Consumers won‚Äôt pay for 3-4 streaming services in parallel.

PS: I think $AAPL made a big mistake to get in the pool./n<neu> @BATMongoose Nice way to see it, although 25% GM. On my math $AAPL is $7000 per iPhone, at a 35% GM and ex-growth... so maybe I am totally off and should add a zero to my $TSLA valuation? üòú/n<neg> Long-term $aapl short by @farrisbaba is the single worst call I have seen in months.

I try not to think how much I could have made./n<neu> @RedDogT3 Funny as I posted the spread on AAPL 200dma of 42+ it dumped 320 res and now 318 sup is being tested LOL 332.25 SPY gap bounce from 1 roll failed to cof above and fell to red as a sweet set. The new pattern is to fade gaps up and push as a 24.75 PE is thin for sure/n<neg> $AAPL one day I will understand this stock maybe.. it constantly gets to key levels for breakout then pulls back and farts around ... it almost never breaks clean and powerfull intraday.. i mean i know its a thick stop but WTF how can it have no hype behind key level breaks./n<neu> $TSLA if this breaks 561 it can drop back to 547,537 next

$AAPL still holding strong near highs.. if it gets through 320 it can see 322,325 next

That's what #TINA has done to us - it's equated four tech firms to the most powerful govt in history. It's lunacy. But that's how hard the Fed has squeezed us./n<neu> I bought $AAPL at 152, sold at 318. $TSLA bought at 220 sold my other 25% here 582. Holding 50% now.

B) show me this legitimate bid; I missed that./n<neu> a weighted average of gold/fx. Therefore the valuation question is actually less ambiguous for $TSLA than it ever has been for #Crypto.

I guess AAPL can‚Äôt carry the mkt all by itself.../n<neu> @NagaBharath786 early today. i played nvda, aapl, nflx daytrade. first 10-20min of market, failed roku. but aapl should continue next week, the sell off today still keeping it on the bull intraday trend. a monday morning dip will confirm oversold and we jump in and ride. :-)/n<neg> @RedDogT3 Rules to live by Scott SPY up date 329.75 res held and were on the way to next target 328.25 but I think it fails as it is early in the day 327.50 will follow as next target VIX is above the 200dma again and were bleeding AAPL below gap and looks to fail Hell of a day all ready$/n<neu> Unless they break $aapl &lt; 315 I wouldn't consider this market broken/n<neu> @NorthmanTrader As of this tweet ~21Million shares of $AAPL have traded at an avg price of 321.50... WHO is buying all those shares?! How will they feel next week? #greed #FOMO/n<pos> @osxreverser You can play the amazing Plague Inc (I‚Äôve had that game for years)./n<neg> @vader7x I dont know. they wont let aapl below 320/n<pos> The funniest thing is every time I look at $AAPL, it seems to always be ticking higher. Must watch longer?/n<neg> $AAPL close to going red ... as I mentioned earlier today at $322.50, if she closes under $320 - the sharks will smell blood and start to circle./n<neu> @ChrisEv70398340 @NorthmanTrader I have plenty of AAPL exposure already./n<neg> Wrecking ball today to the BTFD chasers.  Patience if looking for support today.  Internals are bad.  Tesla is selling off and Apple is almost red. 

I will try to update you all prior to the close and be careful today and keep those stops in. #ES_F $VX #VIX $TSLA $AAPL/n<neg> I can confidently say lot of big companies with exposure to China manufacturing may suffer some slowdowns or potential problems filling new orders with most of China locked down. This could potentially hurt delivery numbers like $TSLA or $AAPL

$SPX/n<neg> @rixstox LOL yeah - $intc should rename itself as little $aapl hahaha 

I can‚Äôt get over that move!/n<neu> @FiatElpis I‚Äôve sold some $SPY puts to buy $AAPL puts.. rolled my long VIX futures into equity downside at last/n<neg> @SEC_Enforcement  I suggest SEC to be dismissed, it is a failure that they allow AAPL manipulators to manipulate!!! @SenWarren  @SenateGOP/n<neu> @NorthmanTrader Update: convinced that client to sell 500 of his 2500 $AAPL position ~322.91 in his IRA account but hold his 5 AAPL 325 Calls just in case I‚Äôm wrong and the stock continues going parabolic. #Greed #FOMO It was pulling teeth to get him to take a profit with no tax consequences!/n<neu> $AAPL just needed that one last leg up today to clean house. Looks like a reversal to me./n<pos> @SqueezeMetrics AAPL has had a strong rally over the past couple of months, however I have a feeling that retail traders are doing most of buying. Do the Dark pools confirm this or is big money actually buying this?/n<neu> @JustinPulitzer If...the market has been short squeezes and liquidation breaks...and we never got the "blow off top euphoria"... maybe this liquidation sets the blow off squeeze into Feb? $INTC held, $AAPL still ATH. Just saying. I'm mostly sidelines atm/n<neg> Voted my $AAPL shares. As usual voted against Al Gore on the board as he adds no value. Also voted against Andrea Jung - It's not personal, but I think there are better choices./n<neu> @RevShark Maybe everyone is selling everything else to buy AAPL. I'd really like to know who is really buying AAPL up here. If Apple is buying their own stock I don't see how that could be seen as prudent use of cash/n<pos> @RSInvestor @JMVala_Trades Agree. All the other internals look bad, too, besides $TRIN: $VOLD $ADD $VIX and every sector on my screen is red except for $XLU. A few bright spots in tech like $AAPL and $INTC. My $SPY puts are working. Glad I took my $INTC scalp profits when I did. Whew./n<neu> @jedimarkus77 when AAPL eventually makes a 30 day low there will be panic..lol/n<neu> @RedDogT3 Let me add you have to work this new normal. HFT Teams work news feeds AAPL up grade before open you can see the 30min program ran to 322.50 then stopped. Just plane and simple to track as to the sell program on SPY gap and fail 8dma test now a fail in play 329.75 is next sup/n<pos> @Makeamillion $AAPL I got after the split , $BABA after IPO, $FB bought in at $25.00 and $NIO under $4... Trying to find something similar ... i like Disney seem ok at range $100?/n<pos> $QCOM I'm liking Qualcomm today since it's down near 90-91. Strong 5G play here. P/E is less than $QRVO and $SWKS. Earnings will be released on Feb 5th after the close. Should bounce higher next week especially with a strong earnings report from chip buyer $AAPL next week./n<pos> I was right! Indexes holding up buy a thread: I continue to see block selling eclipse block buying today 7:1  hardly a bullish trend despite the anemic volume at this rate the NDX the strongest index today could be red by 1230hrs the DOW is hanging green due to AAPL../n<neu> @OptionPit I agree .... it certainly feels like valuations are getting ahead of themselves. I'm tempted to go short AAPL long SPY for a ratio ratio trade :) or better yet short TSLA long SPY/n<neu> @sp3cul8r to me feels like AAPL holding the mkt up today, typical pin Friday, not letting go of the reins just yet/n<neg> I hate to have some calls in the middle of trading I am out of tsla and aapl/n<neu> $AAPL still up 3 bucks, give me a break/n<neu> @biancoresearch Ah yes, but i heard a rumor if you buy or commit to buying AAPL and MSFT stock you'll be immune from the virus/n<neg> If you think this selling is about Coronavirus, you are incorrect,  what is shocking to me is the $$$ still piling into $AAPL.   Right now the single biggest risk to indexes is $AAPL earnings./n<pos> @HuXijin_GT I think US investors are under appreciating the fact that the China market is a catalyst for growth for a lot of large cap US companies $AAPL, $BA, $CSCO, $DIS, $SBUX, $YUM just to name a few.../n<neg> @NorthmanTrader I could‚Äôve sworn that dude was feeding $AAPL shares to the sheep at about $323/share/n<neu> @brendan1411ng I‚Äôm down on this swing as a hedge but I added to it today , $AAPL put sweepers active today biggest order jan31 320 puts $694K in premium paid for put sweep/n<neu> Indexes holding up buy a thread: I continue to see block selling eclipse block buying today 7:1  hardly a bullish trend despite the anemic volume at this rate the NDX the strongest index today could be red by 1230hrs the DOW is hanging green due to AAPL..if it rolls over "Danger"/n<neg> @RyanMorse33 I hope they don't invite that guest back.  $AAPL (i.e. any corporation) would cut its share repurchase program long before a dividend cut.  Based on Apple's financial position, the guest was doing some major silly talk./n<neu> @canuck2usa I have to say calling tops or what ever over and over let us all know you do not get it? We trade, we work charts, Price, Pattern and time to levels and now are new game HFT on news feeds piggy back programs just that simple.

And today. 

Fired soon./n<neu> I guess AAPL better have some EPS report next week. this thing is a freight train./n<neu> @hks55 I think it's over-hyped. Serious, sure. Ebolaesque, no. Won't impact AAPL cashflows./n<neu> I'm getting lots of questions about $AAPL. Often, stocks will hold up or even trade higher into their earning announcements. This is likely the case for $AAPL. The earnings are on January 28th after the close./n<pos> $AAPL getting near our short rental entry level, we are better sellers for the near term on Apple, which in our opinion, has priced itself out of the smartphone market globally. They‚Äôve taken the last $$$ they‚Äôll ever get from me on a smartphone../n<neu> @olivetrader2 @mannysbmw735 Aapl is super resilient actually so far.. so I wouldn't recommend this trade./n<pos> I like green $AAPL better than red ones.  ‚úÖ/n<neu> @NickSantiago01 Let me add AAPL is the tool for sup to Nick with out it this would be rolling much harder then we see but it is early the 8dma SPY is next then we roll to 20dma below as fear comes in and stops start to hit next/n<pos> $aapl Very curious to see their ER next week.. I know a bunch of people who switched to Samsung and other android phones recently. Not sure if it's a bit of a trend out there or just an anomaly./n<pos> @RedDogT3 Needs a day off LOL Scott thanks that was funny! SPY gap and give in play all off of China news like I said early this week this is just starting if not for AAPL game to control on upgrade again. LOL we be down big 330.50 is my target to day on SPY as VIX is talking just time/n<neg> $IBM has a massive portfolio infrastructure in B2B in tech and patents. Their stock value is depressed due to acquisition of Red Hat and analysts beating up the stock in recent times.
I heard similar arguments about P&amp;G, $KMB, $CBP just a couple of years ago and even $AAPL/n<neu> @NorthmanTrader I‚Äôve heard from many that looking at RSI is misleading, but 90+ RSI in the largest market cap company in US is by itself a reason to be aware.

Q: What were you hoping to learn  with this graph?

Never.

First you said this qtr is bearish because it's all iPhone sales, not enough services revenue. Then you say that service rev. is low is because they missed iPhone sales last qtr. So by that logic this qtr bullish for service, no? What did I miss? $AAPL/n<neu> I'm asked my view on shorting $AAPL.  It is 'too much' work. If that is the best short you can find you aren't looking very hard./n<neg> @RedDogT3 Dan Ives was bearish on TSLA and NFLX and missed the entire breakout moves, he doesn‚Äôt understand fundamentals.

I see $AAPL rev growth slowing w/ refresh cycle slowing but that is non consensus opinion.  Historically record high forward p/e here./n<neg> $AAPL only up 1.69% after the report? To me that's a very big disappointment. I think everyone is a little shocked. This is what the world has been waiting for. The BLOW OUT REPORT.
 1.69%? That's terrible!/n<pos> $AAPL with great earnings.. but I think they just announced all the good news and you will hear the downside on the conference call. No bias here.. congrats to longs. I don't mind adding to my puts. Totally agree with @DanielTNiles thoughts he just shared on @CNBC/n<neu> @DanielTNiles I‚Äôve followed Dan for a long time and applaud his consistency. What is strange is his ever changing views as espoused on CNBC. He banged the table shorting AAPL due to the iphone 11‚Äôs lack of innovation. Further 5g at the time was a 2021 story.

I'm-Still-hedged/n<pos> I'm a litttttttle concerned about $AAPL's $63-67B FQ2 2020 guidance, a bit because of the coronavirus unknown, but PARTICULARLY because of the whole earnings warning thing from last year. 

But just a little. Mostly, amazed by management's display of confidence. We'll see!/n<neu> I always go back to the system because the other day INTC was way up and the market was down. So if the sell signal stays on the system even if $AAPL is up. then that's a warning. And that's possible tomorrow./n<neg> $AAPL why isnt anyone talking about the services side not being that great? Sure iphone numbers look good, but I thought the market established that is not future for this company (despite being a big revenue generator)/n<neg> I'm going to try this genre of tweet again:

If you are buying AAPL off these earnings you are TOO LATE

Get in your time machine and buy the stock last year/n<pos> The key is to assess a concept I developed called "franchise power."  The primary driver of this is the strength of the customer relationship.  Apple #AAPL clearly has very strong and deep customer relationships.  Not everyone likes the brand but then not everyone has to!/n<neg> So when $AAPL has their CC, I assume they are gonna address the fact that some of their major supply chain suppliers are completely shut down in China? And not for 3 wks. Possibly months.  

Ahem, no antiviral. Health risks abound.  Cities/Factories are fully shut down right now./n<neu> @pearkes Woah pump the brakes bro...

Some of these guests need to b less arrogant and admit when they‚Äôve made a mistake n he did./n<neu> After-market trading has AAPL at about $325/share. 

Last January 4, 2019, price was $155. 

Every quarter, I remind everyone that January 4, 2019 was basically an arbitrage date.

Tomorrow's price represents a return of 110% in 13 months./n<neu> $AAPL Seeing Dan Niles was coming on CNBC, I switched to Fox Business.

I lightened up on Friday./n<neu> @traderstewie No dip yet ;-) I‚Äôd wait next week after $aapl $amzn earning... spy $300 by feb, there‚Äôs the dip/n<pos> Therefore, I remain favorable to an investment in AAPL for the long term, while I continue to think that Amazon (AMZN) may be a better performer among FAANG names in 2020.
$AAPL/n<pos> While I believe that the valuation multiple expansion of the past 12 months is fully justified by the shift in Apple's business model and product portfolio, I also see little opportunity for further P/E growth beyond the current 24x mark (see graph above).
$AAPL/n<neg> Having said the above, I also doubt that this stock will experience the same levels of market value growth that it did in 2019. $AAPL/n<pos> while doing a competent job at monetizing its enormous installed base. I believe that fiscal 1Q20 earnings will confirm my optimism towards the company and its business prospects. $AAPL/n<pos> Still a high-conviction bull
Taking a step back, I continue to be an AAPL bull. I believe the company is riding the tailwinds of increased consumer spending in wearables and other tech devices outside the smartphone category, $AAPL/n<neg> While I have no reason to believe that growth in service revenues will falter, the segment has experienced a few lumps in performance in the past couple of quarters - see graph above.
$AAPL/n<pos> Due to the parabolic growth of this product category, I would not be surprised to see sales being disproportionately concentrated in the last quarter of the calendar year, $AAPL/n<pos> Importantly, I also believe that AirPods have the potential to be the "unsung hero" of the holiday season. 

$AAPL/n<pos> I continue to believe that the watch will be an underappreciated generator of top- and bottom-line growth in the foreseeable future, $AAPL/n<pos> But consistent with my recent arguments, I don't believe that fiscal 1Q20 will be all about the iPhone. I expect the wearables segment to impress once again on the back of a refreshed Apple Watch that debuted just before the start of the quarter. $AAPL/n<pos> In line with my September analysis, I believe credit should be given to Apple's strategy to make the new models more accessible to the masses. $AAPL/n<neg> But given the lapping of a nearly disastrous 2018 holiday season, I believe that Apple has seen the worst of the deterioration in its phone business.

$AAPL/n<pos> I remain highly favorable to an investment in AAPL for the long term, but I think that Amazon may be a better FAANG performer in 2020. $AAPL/n<pos> Summary
Revenue and earnings growth in the single digits in the 2019 holiday season? I believe Apple can do better.

$AAPL/n<pos> @inner_scorecard Well, that exposure is my entire exposure, including my bank account and a conservative value for my house. It was a pretty big move for me. I didn‚Äôt sell any of my big LT holdings including AAPL and IBM, however. Low cost basis and high realized yields./n<neu> @andrewross11 Thanks for the response sir. I've been shorting AAPL lately more than longing CGC but I don't have the guts to overnight it or swing it short till after ER. Hope I'm there when it tanks!

EPS/FCF, growth rates, customer loyalty and new product/service optionality are what matter IMO./n<neg> $AAPL has a baller quarter, and only gets a smattering of applause.

They have 110B in Debt against that cash thus now less than $100B net.  When I owned AAPL at $450B Mcap they had $150B net cash or just 3X.  Today AAPL's trading ~14X net cash.

I refer to people who buy options specifically right before reports gambling on big moves. Losers on both sides as we stand now 321.75/n<neu> @liepa I listened to the AAPL call this afternoon. Only one analyst asked about the Coronavirus./n<neu> The last time I laughed at $AAPL going DOWN after Earnings report during the AH. It RAN UP for +$20.00. Safe to say, that I'm not saying anything today/n<neg> Action Plan for tomorrow:
Still do not trust this recovery in uptrend. So will be selling on strength as day goes. Quick scalps than swing trades.
If AAPL fades (I think it is as day goes or as week goes and year end profit booking did not happen yet) then short SMH/IYT(DAL, AAL)/n<neu> If $es_f goes below 3270. I go back to scalping both directions.

comparing the source code of iOS with the source of code of Windows,

Might have cost me short term financially given AAPL, but early-ish Uber set my career on a different trajectory./n<neu> @ChrisFLTornado I study price action for last 25+yrs in SPX &amp; all big names specially in extended hours on earnings days like GOOGL,BKNG, ISRG, NFLX, CMG,AAPL,AZO etc. for larger moves. At 4:17 it hit a high @2122.51, in next minute at 2133 threw a market order to sell,got filled 2130.50/n<pos> @Astet32 @KASDad I bought aapl back then sold it around 06, having made a decent sum (for a broke kid) and thinking I was really smart. Lol./n<pos> Played right, $AAPL $TSLA and $AMZN could have turned moderate levels of money into millions. I made nothing on Apple and only caught December moves in Tesla and Amazon. Hope some of you out there caught it all!/n<neu> @strivepositive @charliebilello I will.  In 2001 (21 years after IPO) $AAPL posted a net loss of 25 million and a net profit of 65 million the next year.  In 2018 (21 years after IPO), $AMZN had a net profit of 10 billion. People who bought 3 years ago bought it "overvalued"./n<neu> If $AAPL drops below $290 due to general market conditions and the coronavirus outbreak in China, I am going to have to jump in! #streaming/n<neg> @TheTabernakle @AAPL_Pro @iheartmindy @BreitbartNews I can understand a few of inaccuracies when being fully authentic is cost prohibitive. But skipping ALL research is just lazy and inexcusable. It makes a show built of biased stereotypes and cliches which nobody outside of Hollywood wants to watch./n<neg> @AAPL_Pro @iheartmindy @BreitbartNews Most of the reviews rate it 1/10 stars. That's horrible! Sounds so bad I'm tempted to watch the 1st episode to see how far I can watch before retching.
My favorite review made me laugh until I was light-headed: It's not going to flush, buy a bigger plunger! ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£/n<neg> @IBDinvestors @Zeninthemarkets on 8/23/2019 $AAPL closed down 4.62%, and the intraday move from open to close was  -3.11%.  So in just August of last year (5months ago) there were 2 days worse than 1/31/20's move down which was -4.43%. Without looking I bet that Dec 2018 has many more/n<neu> @monkey_options I am thinking I will change my investment strategy.  Half in SPY...then half divided equally between Aapl, AMZN, GOOG, V, FB, SQ and TSLA...ü§î/n<neu> @charliebilello @tim_cook Can you give me $330 per share for my 1500 $AAPL?/n<pos> Good afternoon everyone!

$AAPL $TWTR $AMZN $BYND $TSLA $LK $BA $NFLX $ROKU $GOOGL/n<neu> People are always asking for a correction but are afraid to buy into a drop because they don‚Äôt know bottom. 

Here are some that I‚Äôm looking to BTD in the future if the markets continue to go red: 

$AAPL $MSFT $ROKU $INTC $DOW $TSLA $BABA $NVDA 

Yes lots of tech!/n<neu> @DougKass @realmoney @jimcramer @tomkeene @SquawkCNBC @CNBCFastMoney @michaelsantoli @LizClaman @andrewrsorkin Berkshire up 47 billion on the aapl investment.

Coronavirus fears are causing the market to have a healthy pullback.

The fed mentioned they will continue their overnight repo operations

$AAPL was finally red on Friday and bears wrnt wild 
$SPY/n<neu> $AAPL, the long upper shadow and the stochastics turning down on the weekly chart tells me all I need to know right now about $AAPL/n<neu> I constantly read+hear that after their 2019 rally #Tech stocks are most vulnerable to a possible correction from the 2019nCoV, but how do you then explain last week‚Äôs post earnings revision rally in #AAPL #AMZN #MSFT #BIDU #LRCX #NOW and I probably forget a few now #expotech/n<neu> With this big dip looks like I will be adding my first position of $AAPL soon in my main stock portfolio. I own a little in my second stock portfolio. But nothing major, so if the market keeps pulling back. I will be adding APPLE üçé #StockInvestor/n<neg> @psk2329 closing 10% of their stores doesn't help. think they knew about this when they reported? i think companies like $AAPL and $TSLA should report results under oath./n<neu> @TicTocTick Me:

Meaning you don‚Äôt need to go outside to buy something. $aapl $baba $fb $amzn/n<neu> $aapl is going to re-open it's stores on Feb 9th when there's 3x more confirmed cases of #coronarovirus ?? That makes sense.. use your brains ppl.. they won't re-open for weeks to months./n<neu> @HayekAndKeynes Makes sense and wasn‚Äôt easy.  Wondering how we approach this ‚Äúevent‚Äù which has tail risk binary sense to it but at same time moment market senses peaked we air pocket other way.  $aapl might sell few million less phones February and a few more then in March/n<pos> @Hipster_Trader I‚Äôm sure that wasn‚Äôt planed. I trust everything $AAPL does blindly/n<neu> @SeattleSun3 Lol! Was waiting for swing high to form. Have to say I flip- flopped back forth there emotionally not catching the exact top of #AAPL #AMZN #MSFT etc...sold last of AAPL at 317.43 and all others on January 17th. I was seeing potential for big surprise gap down. Wanted out.../n<neg> $FB Facebook removes virus misinformation

Congratulations Apple $AAPL/n<pos> @denizmustafatr Another great work! Thanks for the effort.

I have yesterday started to analyse the last financial report of $AAPL and you are one step ahead. üòä

It is indeed over priced, but for such a company ‚Äúover‚Äù is a little bit ambiguous term./n<neu> @jpr007 @ihors3 I was thinking the same thing. I mean look at msft and AAPL both have short positions  (not as big %) but they don't make sense other than a cover mechanic. Mark and the Einhorn tiny boys prob make up to put the short interest down to 20mil cover but rest is cover/n<pos> For the record, anything over 3,000 on $es_f is awesome. We are, and have been in record froth territory. Even Jim Cramer is saying market is too hot and we need it to get negative. Let's get a 3160 test. I suspect it won't hold, and will fall to 3100. $spy $spx $aapl $fb $dax/n<pos> @GreekTrader777 You'll like it, but it works so well for these Twitter services selling "I called AMZN.

The IV crush destroyed me and the stocks faded during the day. Took 75% losses on those. No discipline in stopping out./n<pos> @fertilemyrtles @MadMoneyOnCNBC @jimcramer Aapl high was around 327.85, so when aapl hits 300, that‚Äôs 10% down.  I think it‚Äôs possible. But I would say 280 is a better buying point./n<neu> @iWatch_AAPL @iamfictionary @DatPiff I hate to sound slow, but what does MV stand for?/n<neu> Why I believe new ATH are coming within 2 weeks and my thoughts on today‚Äôs weekly gravestone doji $spx $spy $aapl $tsla $amzn $msft/n<neu> @amyhoy Yeah, I‚Äôm still long $AAPL, short Apple products./n<neg> How long before $AAPL bans the ü¶á emoji ?   I can‚Äôt even do a #Lucille emoji anymore cuz they banned the baseball bat./n<neu> @vins2901 Wait - short $AAPL here or buy puts.. The move up was too fast.. Buy June puts - I have.. And you can also short $SWKS../n<pos> @Cricket99238 If $AAPL does well, so will $SWKS. I believe $SWKS comes with more upside and will benefit more from 5G./n<neu> Got close.

I missed that too but got AAPL calls out of the gate for 29%. Missed the reversal though/n<pos> @hb_skillet Sorry to hear that, man. It's days like today that honestly the best thing to do is buy in early (I'd scaled in, they shook me out decently yesterday but still had some) and hold on. Even if you buy a few weeks out 5% OTM to reduce premium. I played 0-day puts on $ISRG and $AAPL./n<neu> Good afternoon !

Wish I bought: $DXCM $TNDM/n<neg> @LawrenceLepard Statement is misleading: Not so much under performance of small cap as over performance of large cap. $AMZN and $AAPL look stupid expensive to me. People forget that the best way to make real money is to buy good assets on the cheap, not trend follow./n<neu> @78Xantus @c___f___b it happens with almost all the disruptors i know of. $TSLA and $AAPL are just two obvious well-known examples. if you are in it for the long haul, then trust the process to play out. of course, there are no guarantees. hindsight is always 20/20 üî•üòéüçø/n<neg> @shepard30 @elonmusk Sorry! $aapl was first touch screen smartphone thats what I meant.

In a week.    Now pay attention. I don‚Äôt says this happens.  I said if it happens./n<neg> @OJRenick Entirely true. Markets like overreacting and pricing in fear as soon as they can, before correcting later on. It's the $AAPL store closures that scares me more than $SBUX.

Trump tax cuts went mainly to buybacks &amp; isn't related to what Yang is discussing

I own $aapl so not compaining about market performance. I've "repatriated" very well this year./n<neg> I've traded through the tech bubble in 1999-2002 and GFC 2007-2009, so it's going to take alot more than some $AAPL or $FB news and a 3% pullback to shake me out. 

Ok, back to my charts now./n<neu> @thatswildsir @Fxhedgers What do you think happens tomorrow $ES $AAPL? (Bear in mind I will take what you say as 100% guaranteed to happen)/n<neu> @Sandro_power Sandro helps options traders who lack the skill and mental toughness to succeed in this market.

Ended up doing much betta. I study candle patterns often. @Live_Traders beat that into my brain./n<pos> @FoolMCochrane I have held on to $AAPL and thankfully added quite a lot to the position over the years. I have only trimmed shares for the first time in 2020, and only about 10-15% (still largest position).

I would be 6 in 1988. In 2001, I could buy stock in AAPL at the price of basically $1 a share. Today's AAPL stock value is $311 a share.

2004: $AAPL

2017: $DIS

That‚Äôs his portfolio today./n<neg> @BadgerFive @AAPL_Pro @iheartmindy @BreitbartNews I was expecting it to be bad, and it was, but I was prewarned here so I waded thru it. Not one I‚Äôll be adding to my DVR record list./n<neg> @AAPL_Pro @iheartmindy @BreitbartNews I found it on Hulu. Not as bad as I expected but not good either. When you try to please or represent everyone at once something‚Äôs got to give; like story and character development. Maybe they‚Äôre saving that for episode #2? I won‚Äôt be there./n<neu> @KingGordonGekko Yeah I agree; despite MSFT and AAPL being ‚Äúoverextended‚Äù they definitely killed it - AMZN was a laggard forever, everyone was just WAITING for this earnings - lets see what happens ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> @KeithMcCullough $AAPL is going to gap down on Monday.

Our trade partner? The country that makes AAPL and all those other companies rich? Couldn't be/n<neu> @ripster47 Thanks --I just hold AAPL common but have puts/n<neg> @allstarcharts @AlmanacTrader I‚Äôm sure we could create a barometer from aapl earnings beats. But if the market is going down despite our barometer, than the barometer is useless because price is telling real story. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying./n<neu> @vikramaityad Depends on mkt conditions: wild choppy mkt or steady trending mkt. Choose a plan that fits your Risk Mgmt rules.

My SPY plan: I usually trade atm wkly exp, or slightly otm next wk exp. AAPL: I use slightly otm strikes for short term swings, or otm strikes w/ longer term swings./n<neg> @dtellom I don‚Äôt think companies with more debt than cash (not $AAPL obviously) should be buying back stock with that cash instead of paying off debt./n<neu> I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lot of Bears out there for Monday. Just don‚Äôt let the virus scare you. Stocks can do the exact opposite and go up. The unexpected? I‚Äôm not picking tops or bottoms. I‚Äôm a guy controlling my risk.
$SPY $QQQ $AAPL $BA $AMZN/n<neu> I was so busy with $TSLA this morning I didn't even see that $AAPL dipped to $302 at the open. Crazy./n<pos> @flackooo_99 so just share my rule of thumb is dont buy dip on stocks that failed ER. so u see nflx today? it beat ER so it recovered nicely, tsla well we dont need to discuss, so, i am loading $Aapl March 7 call. :-)/n<pos> @damiendonnelly @xiang_aw Yup, you raise a fair point for sure. This is why I believe it‚Äôs good to be long the leaders of the trends.  I‚Äôm long AAPL, DIS, NFLX, AMZN for video.  For cloud long AMZN, FB, AAPL, GOOG, for auto EV / energy TSLA. Some other stuff too, so my portfolio isn‚Äôt totally insanely vol/n<neu> @MadMoneyOnCNBC hey Jim. I was thinking if swapping out of AAPL for MSFT because of apple‚Äôs exposure to China. What‚Äôs your thoughts/n<pos> @VendbienJon @FilmProfessor9 @Mindwbw @daesr1 @NotaBubble @T_Speakeasy @7wtc $GOOG rallied hard today. Factoring in after-hours price movements, we‚Äôre only down $15 or 0.9% on the day. That‚Äôs not terrible. I‚Äôm also now the proud (small position) owner of weekly puts on $SPY and $AAPL so I can be psychologically ‚Äòready‚Äô for the next leg down./n<neu> @MarcelaACordero @BullishBearz Can I get the third option? .... $aapl and $tsla will be ‚òùÔ∏è .../n<neg> @AllThatIsSolid Feel like there‚Äôs too many ppl with vivid memories of other dudes riding the AAPL bull 2007-present and not enough with ones of Lehman or Bear shareholders trying the same thing.

Not saying TSLA is going bankrupt, far from my expectation. But the greed is different level rn/n<neu> @MalkCoin @DarbyOGill_ I mined $AAPL with my CPU in 1993/n<pos> @gilmoreport Had some decent scalps today on $AMZN, $ACMR, $AAPL, but it sure felt like I was flying through the Bermuda Triangle with my instrument panel going nuts./n<neu> @radrob16 @realwillmeade I regularly short the /ES and buy puts on equities like $AAPL when they show weakness. And I am long equities when they show strength. Both can happen at the same time./n<pos> @67Dodge $AMZN is my only FAANG stock. Keeping an eye on $AAPL in case I can enter on a dip/n<pos> @GlobalProTrader @biancoresearch @tradingview @StockCharts TBH, I see signs that Apple $AAPL has had a parabolic move up as well...  But they have broad shoulders and are very diversified.  My guess is Apple drops to $129-$166, but not a total "blow up"./n<neg> Unusual bearish flow: $VXX $BABA $AAPL $I $NIO/n<neu> Numbers were not bad at all for $GOOGL this Qtr...I never say this but I really hope it gets punished even more. So we can all get a quality stock at a bargain price. 
$GOOG $AAPL $FB $SPY $QQQ $AMZN $BABA/n<neu> @thirdrowtesla Anyone ask Elon/Tesla about when a split might occur? Prolly not going to happen right away, but just curious. I remember when a AAPL split seven ways at around $700./n<neu> At one time BRK was my largest holding. With no trading in several stocks notably V, MA, FAANG, MKTX it is now merely one of many. With look through positions in cash and AAPL approaching close to 40% I wonder what‚Äôs next/n<neg> I am still being cautious in this market. $OIL a disaster, Semis $SOXX not coming back, $IWM cracked and still down on the mat. Then you get crazy moves like we see today in $TSLA and $ZM while $AAPL and $AMZN do not participate. I consider these warnings to tread lightly/n<neu> @HawksOrNoOne No, not with TD Ameritrade and i did not by on a DRIP program. Bought T mostly for the dividend and safety but I‚Äòve thought several times I would have been better off buying more of AAPL or FB or the like./n<pos> So...I scalped a few $DIS $AAPL and $SPCE calls today.  Starting the week and month off well!/n<neg> @DeVouge $AAPL? I've never been a shareholder (much to my detriment). I've never been an Apple guy and figured some day they wouldn't be able to keep charging a premium for devices that could be gotten cheaper elsewhere. Seems like that day will never come./n<pos> $BYND , $AAPL, &amp; $BYND have been soooo good to me! I had to rap a song about how WE flipping stocks now!/n<neg> Though a firm believer the $SPX's nominal low came last Friday, I have serious doubts about the $NDX.  Be on the lookout for another down leg to start from the 9188 area.  Let $GOOGL announce its earnings first.  $AAPL should drop to the low 290's/mid 280's./n<pos> @andyisom100K I‚Äôve honestly found that google is the easiest way!

For example:

‚ÄúDoes $AAPL pay a dividend?‚Äù

Then google will tell you yes or now and how much!

It‚Äôs basically a cheat code for new investors!/n<neu> @EricBalchunas @S_Josephs_Ghost Yep, that's one advantage the individual investor has over the institutional investor. I'm not constrained by rules like that. I'd shudder to think how much my total portfolio returns would've been clipped if I had to incrementally sell down my $AAPL stock over the last 15 years./n<neu> @ihors3 I don't think shorting $aapl, $amzn, or $goog is a good idea. Apple generated around $424 billion in free cash flows from 2009 to 2018. Amazon $54 billion from 2008 to 2018. Google $137 billion from 2008 to 2018. They're free cash generating cows./n<neu> Purchased 1 share of AAPL on The HowTheMarketWorks Trading Room Portfolio Simulation call me a business woman/n<neu> .@Sarge986 is back ‚ÄºÔ∏è

Sarge caught up with @NPetallides to discuss his ‚Äúdumpster dive‚Äù and ‚Äúwork from home‚Äù stock picks.

$AAPL: ‚ÄúI am a firm believer‚Ä¶ I think you‚Äôll get $400 for this one day.‚Äù

$AMZN: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs going to $2300, but I don‚Äôt want to pay this price today.‚Äù/n<neg> @HenryWilliams74 @charliebilello @carlquintanilla They probably wouldn‚Äôt. And they‚Äôd have to pay far more than $135B at today‚Äôs price lol. Ford brand sucks ass, btw. Maybe you like it but it ain‚Äôt great around tech. Apple missed their opportunity imo, or maybe not. Anyway, I‚Äôm short $TSLA and $AAPL. I wouldn‚Äôt be long $F either!/n<neg> @iEatVegans2 @charliebilello @carlquintanilla Why would $AAPL pay $135B for a structurally unprofitable company? They be better off buying $F (which makes money) and pumping $20B into it./n<neu> $AAPL discounted again. Should I buy more sharesü§î? #cashflow/n<neu> @fggestal They closed all 42 of their China Stores‚Ä¶ seems obvious this was coming since $SBUX had already close theirs, but earnings estimates do need to come down a bit. I‚Äôm sure some is offset w/ online sales, but not all. $AAPL/n<neu> just in the past 30-minutes, I have seen 8 block sells vs. 1 block buy hardly a bullish trend!

They should have years ago of course but maybe there‚Äôs word of this I dunno. If not, Short it/n<pos> @MDTrades12 @sssvenky Great trade bud.

$AAPL I like its below $308, will likely get some puts into close if we close below. We can run lower easily./n<neu> i am loaded in puts puts puts TSLA AAPL FB  AMZN/n<neu> I'm starting to think $AAPL is taking a position in $TSLA. Insane./n<neg> @russellvalenti Thanks for that, I‚Äôll check it out! This is pretty insane, I wanted to long at $720 today but knew it was against everything I stand for! Haha def a blow off move especially with $AAPL looking weak. They do always end the same!/n<neg> @DougKass @realmoney 1st. Rarely people are as transparent as you are..
2nd. Today is not over yet. $aapl just turned red.I think we are going to close down big today./n<neu> @DilksJay fine. I'm specifically referring to the $XLK Index, 40% of which is $MSFT &amp; $AAPL and close to 1/4 of the entire S&amp;P500. So whether you and I agree or not, that's still the case. I agree with you, but no one cares. especially not the market/n<pos> @GuyGentile I wish $aapl had bought $tsla. I would love to see the Apple car rather than Tesla./n<neu> @MDTrades12 @sssvenky $aapl close below $308 (friday's low) I will go short $304 test with you Venky and we can get to $297, $292/n<pos> The thing I like about $tsla is that on the next financial crisis it will grow like $aapl in 2007. People will put 10000$ more for a tesla (because of FSD) like people put 300‚Ç¨ more on phones./n<neu> $AAPL will be looking to get small sized put spread but want to wait a bit. Below 304 will get me interested for a short to 292-285 zone. Who knows? 

May 300/285 put spread is what I am thinking./n<neu> $TSLA wow.  Got $AMZN, $GOOG, $AAPL from way back when, but missed this one entirely.  My friend was a top exec at $TSLA that Musk fires.  He told me to short.  Thankfully I didn‚Äôt do that.  $TSLA‚Äôs everywhere I see and there is def a bull case.  Not in it./n<neu> @LMT978 Yes, I understood your point clearly. I am long AAPL as well. 6-18 months from now this virus will be a distant memory, and the selloff will prove to be a buy opportunity. You can go broke betting against Apple Inc./n<neu> @lbkingkong @TSOH_Investing For $TSLA , I can say this. $TSLA has convertible bonds that convert above a certain price. So as the price goes past the strike price, the bonds become convertible and hence the company has less risk of defaulting on those bonds. 

I don't know the story about $AAPL though./n<neu> $GGSM more for me! Adding the massive pile. Holding for multipennies coming over the next few weeks. Filings and news to come.

My point was at the current valuation its pretty much in-line w/ many of those other top tech stocks and they are growing much faster, but investors are willing to pay up for low-vol these days/n<neg> I was completely incorrect about AAPL.  I expected a bloodbath this morning on the news they're shutting down in China for 2 weeks.  But it's up $3 today!  A case of "sell-on-the-rumor, buy-on-the-news?"  Any case, this is why I never made a fortune in the stock market./n<neg> Wierd things going on $AAPL i bought weekly 320 calls when its shares trading 308 and now its 312+ my calls are -20% how on earth is that? It doesnt make any sense at all/n<neu> @SeanUmi I‚Äôll do Sweet Baby ($AAPL), $NFLX, and maybe $ROKU./n<pos> I like $IBM $AAPL $TSLA $ROKU $NFLX $MSFT $FB for  continuation and or breakout, The market still have 30 minutes to decide what direction to take/n<pos> @67Dodge @myownadvisor @PassiveCndIncom @AllAboutTheDivi @AthleteDividend @TomDividends @FrugalTrader Interesting results! I should look at how it would have played out in my portfolio over the past 3 years. I don't rebalance (yet), but I keep an eye on my largest holding (AAPL). I will have to sell some shares at one point!/n<neu> I don't know what is bigger joke $Aapl rallying after closing all stores in China or markets jumping higher on ISM manufacturing report, buying stocks on manufacturing data while world's manufacturing hub is getting shut down?

Is Stocktwits flaky for anybody else today? Won‚Äôt reload, stock price doesn‚Äôt update?/n<pos> @SullyCNBC @TriTexan Best product ever made? I can‚Äôt think of a better one. Like the iphones is great, but Tesla put a custom giant iPad screen in the Model S in 2012, way before the iPad came out. $tsla could beat $aapl at their own game if they wanted to/n<neu> @rosaIindfarrell I was pretty sure that SPOT and AAPL shared the exact same amount with labels./n<neu> Someone actually said that $AAPL will have no problems with their assembly plants in China because 'the workers are isolated from the rest of the country in their factories and will be made to work so there is no disruption'.

I can't believe Apple would allow that to happen./n<neu> I'm sure it's in a @matt_levine column somewhere, but is shareholder capitalism even a coherent theory? Does a shareholder like Carl Icahn have the same goals as a shareholder like me? We both bought AAPL in 2014, only one of us still owns it./n<neu> $AAPL I have very little position right now.  Got out with some nice profits last dip but would have liked to stay in, bot small position in one account during the dip.  But no point in rules if I break them.  Looking at writing PUTs until I get back in./n<neu> @tellingsen @aHybridOriginal If they can differentiate themselves and therefore get some pricing power, then I agree. My main struggle was seeing how they could ever charge enough to make any significant money while competitors like $AAPL and $AMZN could undercut them with practically identical services./n<neg> @JamieMcullough I don't think sell side analysts understand what this will do to $AAPL if coronavirus continues through the quarter....which it will./n<neu> @deafdaytrader Trading Update

But Some days like today offer many set ups.  AAPL offered 5 good reverals that could have been done with options on the long side. Both long and short I think was 11 to 1 good trades. I learned that some trade all day, others wait for that perfect setup./n<neg> @ForexLive LOL The # are so duffed and under reported it is Bull shit! NKE just shut down most of there stores and sales are down 75% or better? SBUX IKEA YUM AAPL GOOGL and the list goes on. Now this cure over night news makes it all a JOKE add in are data at 5 years highs? What is true?/n<neu> Take your profit, let the selling subside then if still more money to be made get back in the trade.

I didn't care what the signals said, knew sellers will show up there because that is where the pivot was. $325 Resistance #AAPL/n<neu> sold everything I had $aapl $msft $amzn $nflx at open. just keep $reta and $bmy. 
probably will check back the market in 2hr, then 1hr before close.

I sound like a broken record, but if it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it. Growing the account DAILY.  Not to say I don‚Äôt have a red trades, but it‚Äôs about managing risk and winning more than losing. That‚Äôs the goal. Losses are going to happen. Just win more often./n<neg> @sanglucci @WallStJesus I have the complete opposite take, the market is fully aware of severe economic impact coronavirus may have and is presently short squeezing to distribute into higher, ie $NKE upgrades past 2 days to lift 7 pts, then boom AH $NKE announces. $AAPL is a severe risk as is the market/n<pos> @Frankie11495 @CJGilchrist2 @GerberKawasaki Hard to have a productive debate when you want to call an innovative and cash flow positive company like Tesla a POS. I‚Äôve been investigating for 24 years and have seen very few companies as disruptive. FB, AMZN,
GOOG, NFLX, AAPL come to mind. Tesla is incredibly impressive./n<neu> @CJGilchrist2 @cumiastowski @GerberKawasaki When you can‚Äôt win the debate, make the debate about something else I‚Äôm not arguing and never have.

So who cares about anything?/n<neg> $AAPL I tried scooping these at 0.90 right around 3:00pm but they ran away from me. Oh well./n<neu> @BearlyBullish @awealthofcs I‚Äôm just curious... what exactly do you think share buybacks are and why is it a problem that a company with more cash in USD than most countries should not buy back its stock if it (correctly) sees it as undervalued? $aapl/n<pos> Aapl back to highs pleased I held/n<neg> @toonetown @BradPrick @rseanking @marcoarment @Apple Oof.

A 7% to 10% FCF yield would be in line with history as well. $AAPL trades at a 5% FCF Yield so you will have to get comfortable waiting for at least 20 years to get your money out at this price./n<neg> Grabbed a few $aapl 315s for tomorrow for 28 cents a con. I just really don't trust today and that's about it.

A move above 324.76 should target 333-334.  A subsequent pullback to ~320 should then set the stage for the final move to 372.

What Munger does is "margin of safety" investing. Ben Graham never used the term "value investing." Not even once./n<neu> @delphicapitalsd Me too.  Once that reality changes, stocks like $AAPL will  be 10% lower in a flash.  I think the bigger catalyst would be some type of a liquidity event popping up from #coronavirus.

#daytrader/n<neu> @SamTalksTesla @thirdrowtesla I‚Äôve done the math a few times Sam. Just go on Yahoo Finance for say AAPL and add up the S&amp;P funds &amp; S&amp;P sector funds &amp; what % of AAPL they own. Apply that percent to TSLA shares outstanding . Gives a rough #./n<neu> Huh. I guess it wasn‚Äôt a movie. It‚Äôs an HBO series or something. Watched it on AppleTV. I should own more $AAPL. Well, maybe not right now. But I seem to be always long AAPL some amount./n<pos> I believe there is a lot of growth in AAPL‚Äôs story and there is no reason why history can‚Äôt repeat itself.The next decade has the potential to be just as good as the previous one for the company. I think $AAPL is still a Buy, and shares will trade over $400 per share by May 2021./n<pos> Conclusion
AAPL is a company investors should own, hold and let the dividends compound. I can‚Äôt think of a more shareholder-friendly company when reviewing the value it has generated for shareholders through buybacks and dividends. $AAPL/n<pos> The company has such a loyal customer base that if it branded a package of products to work from the Apple Watch, iPhone or iPad, I think it would be a huge hit. $AAPL/n<pos> I have seen Apple HomeKit products where large companies are creating products that work with Apple Home App, but I think it would be beneficial for AAPL to enter the space. $AAPL/n<pos> I believe that Services will continue to grow, and components such as Apple TV, Arcade and Apple Card will fuel a healthy portion of its growth. $AAPL/n<pos> While 5G should create a super-cycle for iPhone upgrades, it should also spill over into iPads. Not everyone purchases a Wi-Fi-only iPad, and once the LTE version is upgraded to 5G, I think we will see a mini super-cycle for iPad upgrades.

$AAPL/n<pos> Many people, including myself, have been waiting for the 5G iPhone to debut to upgrade. I still have a 7 Plus, and the only reason I didn‚Äôt upgrade to the 11 was 5G. $AAPL/n<pos> AAPL has multiple catalysts
I believe that 2020 and 2021 will be great years for AAPL, as there are multiple catalysts on the horizon. The most promising catalyst is 5G, in my opinion. $AAPL/n<pos> If AAPL is buying its own stock on the way up, why wouldn‚Äôt you? It gives me a great deal of confidence when companies are buying shares at or near all-time highs, because it signals great confidence in the future. $AAPL/n<pos> The fact that AAPL is operating more efficiently and squeezing additional growth out of its current assets is a positive sign to me. $AAPL/n<pos> I think these are in its infancy and have a runway of growth ahead. I think it is possible that over the next decade AAPL could see as much as 50% of its revenue generated from Services and the Wearables, Home and Accessories business segments if these trends continue./n<pos> AAPL is obviously generating a ton of cash, as its revenue came in at $91.8 billion in Q1 2020, but how the company generated it is more impressive to me./n<pos> The company is doing everything right and is firing on all cylinders. I believe at all-time highs, AAPL is still a Buy and I am going to raise my price target to $425 for May 2021./n<pos> On 8/1/2019, I stated that AAPL had a great chance to break $300 per share by May 2020, and in my article on 12/30/2019, I increased that target to $325 and said $400 by May 2021 is a real possibility./n<neu> @pickeringenergy AAPL generated $60bn+ of free cash flow after capex in LTM, which is very similar to the total energy sector. And generated a return on capital that is a multiple of ANY energy company. I agree it *feels* out of whack, but when you look at the figures it‚Äôs not unjustified.../n<neu> @LibertyRPF @LAForeverHall I bought $ISRG at $18 and thought I was a genius selling out at $50. ü§¶

$AAPL at $78 sold at $125.
Bought $BIIB at $41 and sold at $60.

But maybe?/n<neg> @thirdrowtesla Quite often market moves are not congruent with innovation and product maturation/development. I remember being utterly confused at why the market so undervalued $AAPL. Years AFTER iPhone it became what it is. But the market is a SLOW BOAT./n<pos> @BarrySchwartzBW what do you think?  Is $SU the $AAPL of the energy sector.  Company increasing their share buy backs and also now increasing their divy.  Thoughts?  I know you don‚Äôt tweet much about energy stocks, but appreciate your insight and expertise. Thanks for all you do!/n<neg> Dear whoever designed the public education system,
If I had the right education at 16, I woulda been copping $AAPL when it was around $30, 10 years later they going for $320, ya‚Äôll suck, please do better.

$SPX $SPY $NDQ $ES_F $QQQ $TSLA $AMZN $FB $AAPL $NFLX/n<neu> @cap_zay @Suicide95518428 ...buybacks can produce 2.5%+ of EPS growth, such as HD/AAPL etc, although I think we are lying to ourselves, long term, to include debt taken on buybacks, just means less FCF for equity v debt later.I‚Äôm saying the average company can‚Äôt do that.

A well learned lesson. As I look at $TSLA it is all of the above on steroids. And so my concentrated account/n<neu> @LettingGoSays @blondebroker1 I think market is undervaluing pandemic risk, but for now interpreted as having minimal impact on aapl, so bullish short term./n<neu> I believe $AAPL will issue new guidance in the next two weeks due to the impact of the virus on its supply chain./n<neu> What are your best tips/books/calculations I can go to for this? 
PS - RRE &amp; AAPL are just general examples that popped into my head, I'm not comparing the two./n<neg> At what point do my gains intersect? What if it takes 10 years for AAPL to reach a fair price? How do I price this opportunity cost? How do I price in the risk that AAPL may never be at what I deem a fair price and I therefore miss 10 years by holding cash?/n<neu> However, it may take AAPL 5+ years to reach a fair price, so I am missing out on RRE 5% growth for 5 years. But AAPL may have a 15% growth rate, that I want to hold for 20+ years. RRE on the other hand may deliver a growth rate for 10 years before running out of oil./n<pos> E.g a ‚Äòvalue play‚Äô I  invest in today, RRE, I am happy to buy at the current price and hold as long as possible. As it's a commodity lets give it a 5% growth rate. Or I hold my cash and wait for a 'MOAT compounding' stock, e.g AAPL to reach a fair price/n<neu> While I see suppy chain issues out of China having negative effect on equities like $AAPL and $AMZN, I was reminded today by a good trader:

"When adversity hits good companies, it may translate into slower stock growth instead of an outright decline."

Something to consider. ü§î/n<neu> @EliteOptions2 AAPL can take it... I'd say the Corona virus scare is at its peak this weekend.../n<neu> @SharkTankTrader Specific stocks (i.e. AAPL, BABA) getting hit because of the economic shutdown in China due to Corona is a valid argument.

But that's not the same thing as arguing that an overall market correction will occur. Money will simply rotate from those sectors to other sectors./n<neu> I'd like to see how market will react. Disparity index on local time frame $AAPL #AAPL is in "buy" trajectory./n<neu> @EliteOptions2 I‚Äôve been waiting for AAPL to dip some more to buy long./n<neu> @SardonicCanuck Remind me of AAPL last year lol/n<neg> i was looking up the apple store on maps and i just typed it in AAPL. i hate everything/n<neu> @jdells06 @RiskReversal (1 of 2) I was comparing moves, not the cash flow. But if you want to compare free cash flows btw 2016 &amp; 2019 (10 yr treas rate same give &amp; take), AAPL's went from 52B to 64B (23%) but the stock price went from 90 to 320 (255%). MSFT's FCF 64% (25 to 41), stock 291% (47 to 184)./n<neu> @GerberKawasaki Why $DIS and not $NFLX?

Also, I get $AAPL, but why not $MSFT?/n<pos> @David_Kretzmann I would be sad to see $SPOT acquired by another company. But how interesting would it be if $NFLX or $GOOGL acquired them?  It would be an excellent way for them to battle both $AMZN and $AAPL. Personally, I would hope it would be Netflix that does it./n<neu> @dmiles119 @BearBullTraders Ha! I also check $AAPL around that time!/n<neg> @BearHillTrading @BearBullTraders So, I need to prove my qualifications for leveraged ETFs, and stick with the low float pump and dump of the day?ü§° Insanity. And speaking of $AAPL, I check in around 3:30 every day lately. An apple a day, a dollar a day. Don't tell the SEC!/n<neg> @Quarry_Rock @monkey_options @NYDOUGH_PRO Wait, I'm confused. Last night article saying they will resume work on Monday.  Now they are not? $Aapl/n<neu> @BearBullTraders Good idea SEC üôÑ. Push those traders to penny stocks, crypto, sports betting, cock fighting. If traders have a taste for higher volatility, they‚Äôre going to find it and they are going to find out if the can handle it. You can‚Äôt babysit everyone. Meanwhile, I‚Äôll stick with $AAPL./n<pos> @David_Kretzmann I have been doing this for a while and actually have 250+ stocks in my portfolio. that never bothered me and has helped me build a big portfolio. I still had to trim AAPL and MSFT this year because of the market cap which limits future returns/n<neu> @TicTocTick @jakebarrrett yes I bought aapl last year @ 147/n<pos> @David_Kretzmann Think $SPOT makes a very good takeover candidate.  
The $NFLX of the music world for under $100B?  yes, please. 
Makes a lot of sense to me to buy $SPOT if I‚Äôm $FB, $AMZN, $GOOGL, even $AAPL/n<pos> @cfromhertz I am using vertical put spreads, and just can‚Äôt get the premium needed on $PG ... unlike $FB or $AAPL or $DIS etc. $COST has been trending well too./n<neu> @LoprestiJohn @DividendGrowth Buy backs are great if I want a shrinking float and more claim on the existing earnings. Sometimes that is what I want. However I don‚Äôt want $IBM. I want $AAPL. $AAPL keeps reinvesting cash into innovation and has enough to buy shares back. $IBM buys shares back and can not grow/n<pos> @AltitudeChaz This account makes me glad I have $AAPL puts right now./n<pos> I believe $TSLA will do much better than $AAPL over 20 years b/c Apple gets a very small amount of revenue from their cut of AppStore purchases, whereas Tesla will get far more profits from software due to autonomy, sales and a cut of the Tesla Network./n<neu> I will be be back tomorrow night with charts, and I am taking chart requests now for it.

Always better to lock in the loss, then buy the shares/n<pos> @bizruptive $AAPL , $MSFT and $GOOG had a phenomenal 2019 and are at All time highs. You would pay the highest amount ever on a share to enter now. I think they are overbought now and a correction is due to happen, better wait for a good entry.

I'd call some of those frothy. Also add $TSLA to the list. Those having 21% share of $SPX makes $SPY &amp; other market-value indexes poorly diversified.

When it went to $270, I thought the same thing. Then it went to $280. Then $290. Now...at $325, I‚Äôm wondering when the next buying opportunity will come./n<neu> @Benshooter I bought my iPhone with money from $AAPL puts./n<neu> $AAPL up 60% over the last 6 months. I swung it long in early October, trimmed half in December, holding the rest.

Does the valuation seem a little out of hand at 1.4 trillion? Yes. But the market doesn‚Äôt care yet, so neither do I. Once I see negative price action, I‚Äôll adjust./n<pos> $AAPL doubled in price last year AND just gave me free money. #dividends/n<neu> Futures looking slightly green, tomorrow should be interesting as we head into a 3 day holiday weekend.

I just started with MSFT bc it trades better now. It‚Äôs all a learning process. TSLA showed me some areas I need to grow. To me that is invaluable./n<neu> @Canny4 @PMcspuds I don't think AAPL should be the main stock you trade. All instruments should have equal weighting and only the best should be traded for that period of trend which for now is AAPL but it may not be a year from now. What makes you think I am worried?/n<neu> @ZaheerAnwari I agree. AAPL is main stock I trade.  I tried TSLA and lost. Not a big deal. Ur worried about it more than I am.

I miss that guy!/n<neg> @TheStalwart I don't think anyone is surprised but it is not good that they are warning on revenue guidance that they already dropped on the last e/r. The revenue hit is more than they anticipated. Not even sure the last time $AAPL warned pre e/r./n<neu> @WSJ $AAPL is only up about 2.5% over the past month so i feel like this may be priced in at least slightly. im feeling a slip back back to about 310-315. wait for the dip to cool off and then BTFD!/n<neg> If $AAPL will not meet March guidance, I guess most tech will not too... ???/n<pos> @yannickbla I got in at 95 in 2016 and got assigned at 280 in 2019.

People will buy it because people are crazy and lately it's been "do the opposite and make money" day.

Sorry to give the bad news .. enjoy your vacation!/n<neg> @stocktrader300 We know China shut down factories.  We know specifically Foxconn shut down.  If you didn‚Äôt sell aapl then means you believe that aapl will come out of this.  To me not much has changed from the past couple of weeks./n<neu> @CNBCnow It's obvious the corona outbreak is going to affect a lot of companies, $AAPL being one of them.  I have been investing in Apple the last few years, this will just pose another BUY opportunity as a lot of fearful investors panic sell./n<neu> who's bigger and more important? Japan/Singapore or $aapl... 

i guess we find out tomorrow./n<neu> @mikeharrisNY honestly think it needs saturation in order for it to sink in. 

Guessing a lot of these people weren't long $AAPL Sep 18 like I was.../n<neg> @CloisterRes You may be right of course. Still, 1/6 of $aapl revenues is coming from China, and they warned on those AND that they won‚Äôt be able to produce enough for the rest of the world. After this crazy bull run, it should correct, esp with no timeline/guidance. But that‚Äôs just me... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neg> @mnicoletos I went short AAPL last Friday, I bet it will go up tomorrow on bad news/n<neu> @sp3cul8r @PeterTrader99 Didnt Tim AAPL warn on some kind of guidance last year as well?

YES.

Do I believe markets move on the $AAPL warning?

NOPE!

This is how conditioned bears have gotten to ignoring negative news and expecting BTFD to rear its ugly head. I suspect $AAPL is red by about 0.5% by EOD Tuesday./n<pos> @jeffmills_bmt It‚Äôs good AAPL said it but I‚Äôm hoping most people assumed this would be the case. Hopefully I get a nice discount but who knows in this market./n<neg> @Rezleoh LOL, the problem that $AAPL addressed could well affect the world's economy. Trees don't grow to the sky. But I don't know how far they will grow./n<neg> $AAPL I have bears in sight ... bears in sight for takedown. $330 is coming - no one gives a shit about coronavirus. Remember same company said iPhone revenue would go down in 2019 and stock is making all time highs every week. ALL NOISE/n<neu> What other companies will follow the lead of $AAPL? If they are having trouble than so are many others. I expect more of these to follow in the coming sessions./n<neu> $AAPL will be the first of many companies warning.  

The market has been looking past the impact of the Coronavirus, which only makes sense if we are assured that the situation is under control.  Hard to say that is definitively the case right now./n<neu> @techwins @ElaineBenes99 @ntfri @sp3cul8r @PeterTrader99 Oh i see.

$SPX $GOOGL $AMZN $MSFT $TSLA $AAPL $NFLX $CGC $NOW $NVDA $TWLO $LK $RH $COST $NTES $TTD $ROKU/n<neu> If AAPL doesn't hit a $1Trillion MKTcap, I will personally pay off your mortgage! #ThingsStockBrokersSay/n<neu> @pokimanelol If you're new to investing I recommend buying funds instead of stocks.

But if you really want to buy stocks then I think you can't to wrong with $MSFT $AAPL $AMZN

If you want to take bigger risks, $TSLA

If you think Cyberpunk will be a good game buy $CDR/n<pos> @waltmossberg @karaswisher And this is coming from someone who has admired you and your foresight on $aapl and Steve Jobs for a very long time. I invested heavily in 2007 so I always sought out your opinion on new gear and your reviews./n<neu> So in light of these rather conservative estimates (feel free to tell me if or how you disagree), Apple has share price appreciation ahead; however, the share price alone may not be able to rationally beat the market over the next decade.
$AAPL/n<pos> I want to point out that the largest influencing factor on this estimate is my assumption that Wearables, Home and Accessories would grow at an average rate of 20% annualized for 10 years. $AAPL/n<neu> Tying It All Together: Price Targets &amp; Expected Returns
Below you will find what is normally the third step in my valuation model. Refer to some other far shorter articles of mine, in which I clearly employ the three step model, for further clarification.
$AAPL/n<neu> In the next section, I will tie together all of the components of this valuation and include a valuation based on DRIPing Apple in, for example, a Roth IRA.
$AAPL/n<pos> iPhone, Mac and iPad
For simplicity's sake, I combined Apple's iPhone, Mac and iPad segments into one low-growth, mature titan of free cash flow generation.
$AAPL/n<neu> I will of course extract certain items such as updates to their capital return programs from their most recent 10-Q. $AAPL/n<pos> Valuing Each Of Apple's Individual Businesses
As a point of clarity, I will be using Apple's most recent 10-K, instead of their most recent 10-Q to extract pertinent financial data. $AAPL/n<pos> Hence, once one enters the Apple ecosystem, it is unlikely that they will exit, and as Apple introduces more products, i.e., their AirPods or Apple TV streaming service, $AAPL/n<neu> I demonstrate what return you can expect from buying Apple at this price and why buying here will likely lead to underperformance of the SPY.

$AAPL/n<pos> This is a great opportunity to sell the rumor.
Ignore the analysts' spin. Hedge AAPL now to protect your position. Short AAPL now for a good speculative short play, and possibly walk away rich. I'd do it with options because we can do so with an upside hedge inside:
$AAPL/n<neg> Apple's high amount of exposure to China makes it highly vulnerable to the economic troubles related to the coronavirus.
Apple's suppliers are highly unlikely to re-open their factories in Shenzhen due to the true dangers of the situation. $AAPL/n<neu> Guangzhou, another big Guangdong city, was just put under quarantine at the time of writing this. [Source: here, in Chinese. English sources should be out by the time of publication. (I am fluent in Chinese.)]
$AAPL/n<neu> Apple's Factories About to Be Quarantined
More importantly, the majority of iPhone manufacturing takes place in the city of Shenzhen. I suspect that Shenzhen will be locked down by the time I publish this article. $AAPL/n<neu> Again, I find analyst comments hard to believe, as their main constituents are their own clients. Public companies are a bit more trustworthy, as they must act to benefit investors.

$AAPL/n<neu> When reality says things are bad, and analysts say things are good, I tend to look for a possible short play.
$AAPL/n<neu> Not to be a conspiracy theorist, but could it be that these companies are attempting to keep prices high so that they and their clients can safely liquidate their positions, while AAPL is near an all-time high? I make money from being suspicious of analysts. $AAPL/n<neu> @vincent13031925 I'm with you in principle, so don't take this the wrong way, however at a certain point (probably when there's enough profit to do so, but could be anytime, I wish I knew) people start looking at valuation... Will #TSLA be like #AMZN or #AAPL ? We'll see.../n<neu> Targets met for cycle completion of names I track. 0.  Hence. Higher. $spy $spx $aapl $goog $tsla $amzn $fb $bkng.  See you Tuesday/n<neg> @sklippitt @crescatkevin How are profit margins at $aapl $msft $goog $fb $amzn etc inflated. What is inflating them?

Interest rates hurt valuations more than cash flows, particularly given all the companies I mentioned above are net cash.

$AAPL $MSFT $CRM/n<neu> $TSLA 6% from here slaps $900 with ease into premarket, FOMO buyers at open can  create a topple effect and rally another 7% into $970. I‚Äôm long from 260 long heavy capital account and since $650 callout into intra-swing accounts. BEARS ARE

With an 8% weighting in our portfolio‚Äî after having scaled down our equity positions, it remains our largest single ETF holding. Didn‚Äôt hear one single  mention in the financial  channels.  Too busy talking about $AAPL./n<neu> To be clear, I did not own either of these $AAPL positions! I worked these trades up over the weekend and price moved too far away on the open this morning. However, it doesn't matter whether *I* place a trade or not.

As a large company, I'm sure they have many data models to project impacts. 

Stock buyback at lower levels?/n<pos> $aapl makes 50-60% of their revs from iPhones and China is 30-35% of that market. China also makes 95% of all Apple stuff. Go figure./n<neu> So if AAPL is down tomorrow, everyone gets a do-over for the beginning of January 2019.

#es_f $spy $spx #futures #options/n<neg> @michaelsantoli @iEatVegans2 Not buying it for a second. NVDA &amp; Arista see 0 impact but AAPL seeing an impact? Ever heard of ecommerce.

Plus, I though they were a services company now anyway?/n<neg> Any bets on $AAPL falls tomorrow in the wake of today's guidance warning?

If anything, I think this hurts other China-sensitive stocks more than it hurts @Apple.

I understand that has nothing to do with EU or NA but I think it's just too perfect of a ready-made excuse for a shit quarter.

I‚Äôll check in every month with how it does./n<neu> @InvestmentTalkk I‚Äôm not sure there is #value out there.

Unless you meant 10% higher! New all time highs coming suckkkass!!!/n<neg> $aapl price recovered just 1 day after it announced it would miss revenue guidance- seems like a sign the market is becoming complacent.

Are you worried about overvaluation?   AAPL earned $13 per share over the last 12 months.  It has $22.50 of net cash.  At tonites closing price it yields 4.4% (13/(319-22.5)).   30 yr yield is 2%.   

Overvalued?  Nomiso Oxi./n<neg> An office mate just told me "The market took a HUUGE hit today because of $AAPL!"

Apparently, opening down 0.5% and closing even is huge now? This is a normal fluctuation on an average day.

People really are now conditioned to think markets only go up!/n<neg> @wabuffo If the only thing impairing Apple‚Äôs earnings prospects was the uncertainty of worker shortages and supply chain disruptions then I‚Äôd be more sympathetic to that argument.

$AAPL $NVDA $AMZN $BYND $TSLA $SPCE $BA $NFLX $ROKU $GOOG/n<neu> Ultimately, I don't care if you think I'm a scam or not. I am me and you are you. I know how to make money in this market. Maybe you do. Maybe you don't. Maybe you pretend you do but truly don't. 

The only person you should be honest w/ is yourself. Nobody else. $AAPL/n<neg> The stock market doesn‚Äôt care who we as individuals are, what we think, or how we feel. It‚Äôs a beast like no other: indifferent to human desires, oblivious to common wisdom, maddeningly contrary, and seemingly bent on confounding the majority at every turn. ~ O‚ÄôNeil $AAPL $GOOGL/n<neg> Some of you may come to love trading - if you can still call it that... 

The question is, can you last? 

I will most likely keep doing this until I die or get so sick of the manipulation I utterly give up.

Predictions are kewl but useless when daytrading./n<neu> Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs letter is out. There is a lot to like with $BRK.B at that price in this market, but the size of the $AAPL stake is still holding me from making this a core position./n<neu> @jimcramer Hi Jim, I have been raising cash too.  Hate the way this market feels right now.  Coronavirus is a game changer.  I‚Äôve had big gains over the last 3 months.  When gains feel too good to be true, I ‚Äòve learned to take them and sit and watch for a while $AAPL, $MSFT, $AMZN/n<pos> @SethCL @vivekBWT Look at mega cap tech.. particularly mature businesses like $APPL and $MSFT : 25 and 31 p/e respectively.. I‚Äôd say that 90 P/E for $AMZN is more reasonable than 25 p/e for $AAPL.. also $NFLX at 90 p/e is crazy given how competitive space they used to have to themselves became/n<neg> @davidshapiro61 That 11% is really disappointing... particularly while considering that $AAPL is by far their largest position - and the stock was on fire in 2019. 

I think $BRK need to cut out a lot of traditional businesses and finally embrace growth tech more./n<neu> $AAPL related:    #Samsung Electronics confirms #coronavirus case at phone #factory complex in S.Korea       #covid19/n<pos> @eosfanatic based on my data analysis i come to the conclusion that the sentiment is still very positive for btc accumulation and reflects the trends of other hugely great roi equities (e.g. $aapl) , it makes no sense, there's pain all around us, but im personally convinced it'll only go up/n<neu> @eosfanatic yea it makes no sense and the market is pure savagery but it was like this in btc's last great cycle post-gox... and there's still an insane appetite for crypto (i know it makes no sense) but i do a lot of data analysis and am convinced buying btc is still like $aapl 20 yrs ago/n<neu> @DonnellyDeborah @Market_Scholars I'm not ready to buy just yet. I did start selling puts on NVDA, well below where the gap would be filled. I was also looking at selling AAPL puts or SPX put spreads, but need them to move down more. TSLA has been good, but not today, need sharp moves down to sell puts./n<neg> @heartsandparts @Market_Scholars I bought aapl yesterday and sold today. Why? Cause I held onto FXI and didn‚Äôt think the artificial fluctuation would happen as soon as it did. I don‚Äôt trust us to go bearish into a weekend with some company stating they have targeted something to make the stock soar./n<neu> @Mobnug11 Sweet. Took a trade on aapl this afternoon and got a break even, and I walked away, pissed. One of the hardest trading decisions I have to make now. @MyInvestingClub   was right about just moving on to the next one.  Trading costs are so much cheaper than a big loss./n<neu> @traderNY12 @SwatResearch Wanted to add I did not take any of his trades and don‚Äôt know if the 50 percent of trades listed as profitable were legitimate. It would be a clever marketing ploy, to claim only 50 percent trades profitable to distinguish the service from all the moderators claiming 80+ percent./n<neu> @BerkyBerk1 I‚Äôd imagine some of those dividends were used to purchase the $AAPL stake... so they have roughly doubled in value. Would add a bit to the CAGR from a big picture lens/n<neu> @traderNY12 @SwatResearch I mean, he had 15 trades one week on the SPX and SPY options and every single one of them was a loser. Yet overall, it was 50 percent accuracy and he listed enough profitable trades that he made good money. So how does a subscriber decide which trades to take?/n<neu> @traderNY12 @SwatResearch I joined for a month last year and thought the service legitimate. Positive was there seemed to be transparency, in that every trade was listed. Negative was there were 80+ trades some weeks, and how can anyone possibly duplicate that.

Given Apple's market capitalization, that drop is still a pretty big dent./n<neu> @billybobmcmanus @CNBC When VIX is under 16 I buy 1000-2000 shares of MSFT at 2:59:59PM. I start looking at AAPL at 2:40PM. I try to buy 100-600 shares b4 the close. If AAPL or MSFT was dn I sometimes wait until 6:55PM to buy in. I sell MSFT b4 market opens, usually.

I try not to trade when the VIX is over 16. I only trade AAPL &amp; MSFT &amp; sometimes MCD. They always come back if you make a mistake.

Saw Corona-thing coming./n<pos> @BuddyBeane Apple is holding up surprising well, and i like the consolidation on the daily charts. On a market bounce I'd love to buy it. If it gets nastier though....a lot of China exposure. I'm holding long stock in $AAPL and buying $MSFT options./n<neu> @letsgojim1234 Kinda true.  But a few things I should've done

Don‚Äôt watch @CNBC/n<neu> @LMT978 I remember buying $AAPL for 140 in Dec 18.

Then sold for 200 only 9 months later (gain +50%)

It reached 334 recently and now back to trading bellow 300.

Maybe the 200 mark is possible, but I doubt it.

But what do I know? That only a long term well diversified portfolio works./n<pos> $AAPL if it can build above 300, I may be interested in a scalp long./n<neu> @nbactavis Relax I have shares in $aapl can‚Äôt lose my coins/n<pos> LOVE days like this when you're all cash.

Scaling in.

So I‚Äôm gonna say this now. If they use today and/or tom just to bounce, I‚Äôll call it a week and not trade. I‚Äôll wait til next week. 

I don‚Äôt like deadcat bounces. I prefer conviction bottoms. $aapl/n<pos> @RightSpin1 @CNBC I'm waiting. $AAPL/n<neg> This attitude felt pretty stupid at the time, and I definitely missed a lot of the rally along the way, but so many charts a few weeks ago were just ridiculous.  A little caution is good.

$AAPL $SPX/n<neu> My recommendation would be for investors to lower the share of AAPL stocks in their portfolio, while waiting for a price correction, which I believe to be only one quarter of missed expectations away, before reinvesting. $AAPL/n<neu> Since I am not worried at all about a potential coronavirus pandemic, I see all price movements triggered by infection news as temporary and insignificant for a long-term investor. $AAPL/n<neu> I am writing these final lines of the article on the morning of February 18th, with AAPL down 2.9% in early trading due to the "coronavirus impact". $AAPL/n<pos> I believe that projected financials, using analysts' estimates, represent a far more sober tool for valuing the company, rather than relying on exuberantly optimistic narratives about AirPods and similar gadgets changing the world.

$AAPL/n<neu> Then, for each year's EPS, I have calculated the corresponding stock price if the shares are valued at 15.6, 17.5, or 20 times the price to earnings ratio. Fields marked in green represent values higher than the current stock price, red cells represent lower.

$AAPL/n<neu> Based on the projected earnings and the estimated rate of share repurchases, I have calculated the projected EPS for the next decade. $AAPL/n<neu> While I have included projected stock prices for P/E ratios of 17.5 and 20, I assume that the reversal to historic median P/E of $AAPL/n<neu> Two scenarios
At the end of this article, there is a link to a spreadsheet, which you can use to make your own estimates. Here, I will briefly walk you through the two scenarios that I consider to be the most likely.

$AAPL/n<pos> It is also important to consider buybacks when projecting future dividends. Over the past five years, Apple has paid out an average of 21.6% of their free cash flow as dividends. I have projected future dividend payments assuming this ratio remains constant.
$AAPL/n<pos> In the course of my research, I have determined something that may be an obvious fact for more knowledgeable investors, but new information for many others. $AAPL/n<pos> Therefore, if growth in Apple's revenue from the wearables and services categories was the catalyst for the stock's bull ride, it is the expectation of future buybacks that makes the current price reasonable.

$AAPL/n<neu> Over 313 billion dollars have been spent over this period on buybacks. This is a factor which was completely absent in the high-growth years that I analyzed in the section above.

$AAPL/n<neg> Therefore, I conclude that the financial aspects of Apple's business absolutely do not warrant its current exorbitant valuation.

$AAPL/n<neu> With both positive and negative factors, which are impacting margins, considered, I conclude that a clear trend, which would yield increasing margins in the future, is not visible. $AAPL/n<neu> As I like to mention, raised valuation multiples imply either a strong improvement in margins or substantial acceleration in growth rates. Neither one of these conditions is present. $AAPL/n<pos> I will assume that their sales estimates offer a more reliable gauge of market potential for Apple's products and services than you or I could possibly make. Therefore, this article will focus on finance, and I will attempt to answer the following questions: $AAPL/n<neu> In this article, I will use consensus estimates on sales, earnings, capital expenditures, etc. for the next ten years, as provided by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. $AAPL/n<neg> On the other hand, I may be wrong - I vividly remember saying, back in 2001, how annoyed I was by SMS messages and how I never intended to send a single one in my life. That prediction hasn't aged very well...
$AAPL/n<neu> ranks only just below my urge to volunteer for a future mission to Mars to grow crops, in the Matt Damon, "The Martian" style. (I am assuming you have seen the movie, if not - google it. It's not a pretty sight.) $AAPL/n<neg> On a personal note, I try to be less "plugged in". I can't stand earbuds, and my desire to walk around with them, and to have various notifications poured directly into my ear canals, $AAPL/n<neg> I am skeptical, to say the least. I don't see how an accessory for a device could possibly be as relevant to a user's lifestyle as the device itself. $AAPL/n<neu> It is fairly well known what this unbridled optimism is all about, so I am not going to waste too much of your time regurgitating the same story in detail. $AAPL/n<pos> OK I think we have our two winners for today!

I had 6/8, actually made money and all accounts closed green on the day. After this horrid week, I'll take anything I can get. $AAPL $T $TNA $MSFT $ERX $GS $CAT $NUGT/n<neu> And selling all. I'd rather just not think about the markets this weekend. $TSLA, $AAPL $MSFT/n<neu> If you gonna buy AAPL or MSFT from the coronavirus dip I think now might be the time. I did it today. I think people are starting to accept that it‚Äôs a glorified cold that won‚Äôt materially impact those companies in the long term. E.g. panic is dying down/n<pos> Nice run into the close for $TSLA, $MSFT, $AAPL. Glad I bought back on the dip./n<pos> Who else is really glad they have a lot of money tied up in memorabilia and cards as opposed to MSFT AAPL AAL etc ( although I have more then I would like) LeBron and Jordan have gone up this week..../n<pos> the next round of 13Fs will be interesting. I bet big investment whales piled into names like $AAPL $MSFT etc. esp if they missed the rallied first time/n<neu> @EricBalchunas @mmkhalifaa Let me guess...it'll mostly own MSFT, GOOG, and AAPL, because you'll use those to work at home, and charge 60bps./n<neu> @hnrtrading Hi Jeff, not possible for me to get VXX, would AAPL short do the same trick? Since it is basically the SPX? 
Arie/n<pos> @BearingtonTrade AAPL looking for that 50% fib retracement to $240. SPY looking for that 61.8% at $273 since it touched 50% at $286. March will be interesting.

I am sure you not new to this game as we were at gap from open SPY 288.71 and ready to start a flush. AAPL is a tool on market control. Just a heads up./n<neu> @UCastellotti I do - feeling we get a bounce - I‚Äôm long aapl and gld - sure we will see some Fed News (like we just saw now) 

Let them pump it up a little - internals are so oversold 

Unless nyc reports cases - or they close Disneyland in Florida lol then all bets are off/n<neu> @unrealThetaGang keypoints i want to make:

1.  i'd rather not sell the put in this scenario because I already have to much obligation on $V $AAPL and $NVDA

2. no matter how much DD you have I need to express how much of a lotto a 20-30% options are when you buy them

3. leave comments/questions/n<neu> @herc628 @jonnajarian @tim_cook @jimcramer LOL First I am not Liberal. This was a timed news release and to stop the market from rolling Kudlow came out same BTFD HFT were turned on like you seeing AAPL ripping 8 from 264 off of words. SBUX open is fine sales are? Just asking for a friend?/n<pos> $AAPL Watching #warren #buffet on Becky Quick, she asked, is he buying Apple. His reaction and the redness of his face I would say the answer is yes. #stocks $spy $spx $BRK.B &amp; #apple are buys for sure. @BeckyQuick $amzn $tsla $msft $fb/n<neu> @ForexLive Well said my brother, just like now a pop on Tim talking up AAPL and China as to the rev on SPY &amp; VIX to even think the news on this will not blow up over the weekend?

A correction matched by its previous rally. I can feel it in my gnads. Big gnads. Looking to scoop some AAPL or DIS at a frothy discount/n<neu> Corporate events being cancelled months in advance, uncertainty still higher than ever.. no bottom in sight. There are long term buying opportunities right now, but I‚Äôm still waiting for a better entry $SPY $QQQ $AAPL $BABA $NVDA/n<neu> @QTRResearch AAPL reopened 80% in China? Rightttt I‚Äôm sure no ones leaving their home here in US/n<neu> Planning on swinging $aapl long and $spy short over the weekend to hedge it

I‚Äôd be truly surprised if we opened Monday under this weeks lows - not saying that we won‚Äôt get there soon 

Wait for some QE news or good news to spring up/n<neu> Bottom is in. How do I know ? My sister calls in a panic. Happened in 2008 too.  $aapl $ma $nktr $amzn $SPY üòÇ/n<neu> $SPY $SPX Added some Mar 6 280 puts I am going out on a limb and saying we close on the low's of the day. $TSLA $AAPL $NVDA $NFLX/n<neu> @lordofthebags @CNBC @acorns This is nowhere near done.   6 months at least till things cool off. 

I'm going to be buying $aapl stock at 50 dollars a piece or less.

I guess the computers decided they needed to sell some more. $aapl $msft $fb $roku $spy $gild/n<neg> @amyecheetham 2018 comp tough b/c (I think) was mainly related to fed/trade war uncertainty. To your point, $AAPL revised guidance could be overblown or just the beginning. $UAL abandoning guidance all together b/c outcomes were too broad is def not good sign. Problem is won‚Äôt know for a while/n<neg> Based on yesterdays its that time when MMs start dumping and duping the unsuspecting retailers. I just dont think its gonna rally towards EOD as theres no end in sight regarding Coronavirus. Once the real resting begins,  $TSLA $QQQ $SPY $AAPL $BYND $AMZN $NFLX $GOOG $EXEL/n<neu> I fully expected $SPY $QQQ and most of the big movers ( $AAPL $TSLA to close at the lows today ahead of the weekend, has much of the irrational fear been priced in?

Could see that get pumped to pump dow. But WHY!?!!?/n<neu> Am I suppose to beehive that AAPL has manufacturing issues but NVDA doesn't?/n<neu> Like yesterday. If you bought the S&amp;P down 100 you just made A LOT of money. The intraday Bounce trade is where it's at. SHORTING RIGHT NOW IS WAY TOO LATE.

Need those computers to come back and start buying again./n<pos> @EyeoftheStormZ Thanks for sharing ! I've been making small trades throughout the trading days all week. NVDA is my top performer and green. Got into some AAPL yesterday and today. MSFT got in a little early but have a lot of powder dry still to buy into this stupid #COVID2019 downturn./n<pos> I have the absolute best trading room on the planet.  Lots of us crushed $SQ $AAPL $SPX $TSLA $FB $NVDA and others today.  In the face of fear an blood in the streets, we went long.  too many to thank for the great sets of eyeballs. #circadiantrades/n<neu> @Sandman7591 That's would be my concern. $AAPL could pick up or lose $5 to $10 bucks in less than an hour right now, so I'd err on the side of not letting winners become losers. I foresee lots of chances in front of us over the next few weeks./n<neu> @aztecs99 Exactly...I saw a $6 range on a 5 minute bar in AAPL...fast markets right now/n<neu> As long as we hold 2900, there should be more push upward.

*points at disclaimer that's been up since I first started social mediaing in the first place*/n<pos> @ozenrique @xCaptainEO Cashapp is also cool if you want to buy a portion of a stock and not a whole share, like throwing $5 into $AAPL

(As a professional I was a minor expert on diversification; my wealth is in a mix of US &amp; intl equity indexes, bonds &amp; Bay Area real estate. AAPL is my only over-index holding)

Apple depends very heavily on their supply chain and they have strong risk mitigation practices/n<neu> @HulkCapitalPro When you look at AAPL what makes you believe in a pull back to $250? Not questioning your knowledge just asking for an explanation/n<neu> @zwburger üòÇüòÇüòÇ facts. I got SPY, AAPL, and BA puts that I know about to print 2ma at open. Sold my SPY $300 puts right at close. And bought more with more time/n<neu> @anilvohra69 I checked AAPL 10-K they will only buyback when the stock is on an uptrend. They made 0 purchases in Dec 2018. ü§¶/n<neu> $AAPL AH action today was slightly capitulating but was it enough? I hope not. But when AAPL broke $270 someone big stepped in. Looked like they were willing to buy any and everything under $270 ($SPY $295 break same thing)/n<neu> @MDTrades12 What makes you think it was smart money pushing AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN up so much?  Maybe it was just billions/trillions of money going into index funds?/n<neg> @KingGordonGekko Aapl , msft but I do get your point that the reaction is overblown.. My point is it is unfair to compare Corona with diabetes or heart diseases/n<pos> @WHODATVOL I also like AAPL especially if it pulls back even more, down $54 in 2 weeks/n<neg> 2018 mayhem in just a week.. spy and dow clueless direction. Aapl 20% down already.. msft biggest ever one day drop I think.. all it needs for us Markets to melt from here is one death(friends talk).. just one death and I wouldn't be surprised if we see 250 on spy in no time/n<pos> $brka, $aapl, $amzn, $goog, $qqq $msft $fb all had parabolic moves (less so $brka) all  have great potential to pick up at discount prices. let me know if i'm missing any other blue chip names/n<pos> @JohnnyFarmer69 $AAL $BP $ALL $PENN (if you want to play the barstool acquisition) $AAPL is always a buy. Anything you wanted last week is 10+% off. I love a sale!/n<neg> Worst #DowJones drop in history, fastest correction in history.  Blood on the streets, panic all around.  Me:time to go shopping. $aapl $msft $shop $amzn/n<neu> I'm sorry, but FUTURES ARE GREEN!? GTFOH dip buyers. Reminder: tomorrow is Friday. I won't even mention the _________ virus. When will you learn? $SPY $AAPL $MSFT $TSLA/n<neu> $AAPL might be close barn door after horses fled trade. i put on a put spread collar. buy the Apr 250/235 put spread, sell Apr 300 call to help finance-$1.05 debit. short call against the Jan2022 call/n<neu> @keithcornacchia Obviously. Quite similar industries though hence why I tag them. Like QQQ and AAPL or XLE and XOM./n<neg> When you have big moves  like this. You stick to the core view. Which bounce or not, this market still has lower to go. Me and fintwit rarely agree.  And let‚Äôs just say that expains a lot. lol. $spy $spx $aapl $goog $tsla $nflx. $amzn 50% winrate doesn‚Äôt work for me. I want more/n<neu> $AAPL I wish that wild ride Friday from $257 to 278 to 264 to  273 had occurred over a couple of trading days so I could  have reacted and bought some. üßê

Either way, quick turnaround./n<neu> $MSFT Far off from ATH, Headlines and Algos have one job for set directions within the markets. MSFT high pressured selling will see 149.87 142.87. I‚Äôll close short unless they cure the headlines and MSFT gaps up 11% other then that you know the

I‚Äôd love for my SPY and AAPL calls to finally rocket offüçæ/n<neu> I mean similarly, people bought on Dec 26 2018 when markets looked like they were gonna die a horrible death and those people enjoyed a healthy 1000% return on their longs. $aapl $googl $tsla $nflx $c/n<neu> @BobbyTrashbear I‚Äôm in AAPL call/n<pos> @RealJamesWoods I won the spelling bee held for the 4th, 5th, and 6th grade!/n<neu> @BlackBoxGuru Did you also see that I "predicted" the $SPY would hit $287 ($286-ish low) and $AAPL $250 ($256-ish low) Fri the 14th? With charts to illustrate?  Did I short or buy puts? No (SMH)/n<neu> @CGasparino I also called the bottom on Friday and bought into the close.  Clearly overreaction to see $AAPL trading in 250+/n<neu> Honestly based on Friday‚Äôs strong close, I think Monday and Tuesday could be very green days due to markets oversold condition. $aapl $spy $fb $roku $baba $ba $sbux/n<neu> @RuthlezCEO üëå

Both down more than 20% of 52 week high. Also got into a little $COST. I'm waiting for more of a drop to add to my other positions like $AAPL/n<neg> @RobMeyer9 @NorthmanTrader I‚Äôve been hardcore bearish since 2016, made money on the mini crashes, but lost it all back on one v-shaped recovery after another. I finally gave up trading/timing the crashes this January. I did put in a final aapl jun puts trade and the rest in SPXS (3x spy bear etf)./n<pos> Some positions are AAPL MSFT NVIDIA TSLA AMZN TTD SHOP BABA. for now I am sticking with quality as they might weather the storm better./n<neg> @Ginkohoz I agree that this can get worse because right now I sense no real fear or panic yet. Even $MSFT $AAPL are down just a little bit more than the market.

I still believe that the market is just getting rid of Passive ETFs held by the non-investing public. We will see./n<neg> @RealBrianWatt @HayekAndKeynes To be honest I think that no1 besides families give a fuck about that 2-3-4-5k dead - but everyone at markets cares about factories supplying Aapl / Samsung / car makers etc. if it‚Äôs working or not - their fear is as huge as valuations and debt elevated/n<neu> @financesis No prob. Yes today I purchased XOM off of the 52 wk low.... and looking to purchase TGT if can reclaim and hold the 200D. TGT has earnings Thursday. Also picked up some AAPL for a swing trade/n<neu> @financesis I‚Äôd say pull up the charts... you have a lot of stocks that broke or came close to the 200D MA.... And the 200D Is a pretty solid support. Many stocks broke it and then  reclaimed it (AAPL, TGT) SPX is still trading under the 200D ..../n<neg> @aus_econ @niremas $AAPL is in the worst trouble I suspect. Those huge iPhone margins are built on working and living conditions in Foxconn facilities that are ideal for virus transmission. Think half a million workers living in tiny dorms with eight bunks, communal meals in massive canteens.../n<neu> $AAPL had the Apr03 280/295 credit put spreads left from iron condors, rolled to Apr09 280/295 for .10 debit, added Apr09 300/315 credit call spread at $1.70 credit (2x). i expect to get tested on the calls before opex/n<neu> @BrandonBeckham_ @real_defender @realDonaldTrump @Mike_Pence How many farmers are employed by Amazon, Google, AAPL, Microsoft, Tesla, GM, GE, etc.  I think not too many!/n<neu> $AAPL had the Mar285/295 credit put spread from iron condor left. Rolled to Apr285/295 .50 debit and added Apr300/310 call credit spreads for $1.33 credit. calls pays for the roll. i expect to be tested on the calls prior to opex/n<neg> @MessiahTheories I wrote down $DOCU $AAPL $SQ $DDOG $CDLX $ROKU $FIVG $SHOP 5.5k probably can‚Äôt buy all of them./n<neu> @PeterSchiff but I thought gold was going to protect me from market excess?  I wanted to sell some gold today to buy AAPL but down $50?/n<pos> shweet day for me, a green AAPL scalp in 4 minutes, and just after  1pm a SPY trade which paid a bit over 20 and bit over 50%, done with the learning at #Tricktrades , others had even sweeter wins. You too can learn to do it, come and see,üëç/n<neg> @RobInTheBlack I don‚Äôt think $aapl can go to zero. GM never made the money that Apple makes./n<neu> @IdeasPrime Give me AAPL and MSFT plz/n<pos> @seyedoption Remember the $AAPL PUTs I bought from the .@xrp_Prophet story about Apple buying United $UAL tickets. I closed it today. I bought 2 puts for $13.60 on Wednesday, sold them today for $28.00. $2880 gain.

Thank you .@xrp_Prophet and .@permabear_uk for the inspiration./n<neu> @MessiahTheories I put everything back in yesterday and today. YOLO! No margin though.  Mostly adds to $msft $aapl $amzn $tsla $sq $ayx $ttd $roku $ilmn $nvda $spce $plan and $estc/n<neg> @BruceKamich
That doesn't make me feel good, but AAPL up, QRVO, SWKS, LITE BMY T up, concerned about ABBV./n<neg> @lthomps54 @Shem_Infinite I think we will have at least 1 1000pt day next week. VIX is so high all it has to do is drop about 5 or 6 points in an hour or two and you'll get that rally. I only trade AAPL &amp; MSFT now that I'm retired. I can't trust having to wait a year for a market recovery./n<neg> @JonathanHoenig @Varneyco @BullsBearsFBN @AftertheBell @TeamCavuto Bought AAPL @ 270; bought INTC @ 60; tell me how stupid I am in June./n<pos> $AAPL impressive gapclose today. Even though it can bounce more I am missing my favourite bottom patterns. Bottom at 250$ would be nice.
Wouldnt be surprised if we get another flush down in the market next week./n<neg> @BillGriffeth @CNBC @KellyCNBC @ScottWapnerCNBC @Colarusso42 The jokes come when that clown Cramer says YES when Faber asked on Thursday if it‚Äôs fine to buy AAPL($290) on @SquawkStreet 
Friday on @HalftimeReport he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs too soon ($260)

Kinda makes a joke of CNBC‚Äôs ‚Äúspecial reports‚Äù/n<pos> @jbdridgebacks After all the bad news I feel ok about my aapl calls I left over. I bought them when SPX was in 2880s.

$MSFT $AMD $AAPL/n<pos> @permabear_uk Thank you. I forgot to ask BABA. If not today maybe next time. Fortunate that it‚Äôs not getting dragged down by etf. At some point it might be better to sell that and enter aapl/n<neu> @AlphaMind101 I bought $GLD a month ago.. watched the @PhilTownevents indicators, dropped my $AAPL long Calls, bought more $GLD Calls 4/17 exp, sold ATM weekly options on $GLD for last week and next./n<neg> @Paul_Schatz Paul if they act to night I think it would cause fear as to not telling us the truth about real #? It is bad that China is lying and AAPL Tim saying factory's are rapping up? When there is no pollution at all above China? This is facts, as it is real Data on out put! Just Math!/n<neu> Good afternoon! Will post some charts on here like I do every Sunday. How about that $REGN from last Sunday‚Äôs post?üöÄ

Friday was the first day it outperformed the Nasdaq i think. $AAPL./n<pos> @osPatriot Good for you.  My three top performers (over last couple of years) AAPL, ADBE (this was a stoke of luck), and PG.  I also own BA (still in the black) - but we had a little issue w/ 777 Max software./n<pos> @OptionsMike I liked the way $QQQ defended it‚Äôs 200dma while $SPY was weak

Especially, nice bounce in leaders like $MSFT &amp; $AAPL (none of those gave back their gains) 

If tomorrow we see another Green Day in those names, we might not go below Friday‚Äôs low anytime soon/n<neg> @SwingPyro Damn I have a call option for $AAPL , you expect it to go down that much ?/n<pos> @zen_n_trade Agreed and more $aapl stores coming back in line. I think $AAPL can lead in the bounce or at least calm markets in face of panic./n<neu> (1/3) My top long-term targets amidst selloff, which I intend to buy/hold for a decade:

Why would I buy the new one if I already have the old one???? $AAPL/n<pos> @TTHisreal @yuriymatso Yes it did.  I bought a lot of AAPL calls early in the morning kinda expecting a rebound...although it didn‚Äôt come til the last 10 min lol.   The daily would look good if we don‚Äôt gap down too far tonight or actually just go up from here and leave that spike on the daily chart./n<neu> $AAPL related: #SAMSUNG ELEC #AGAIN #SUSPENDS MOBILE DEVICE #FACTORY IN GUMI, S.KOREA AFTER #CORONAVIRUS CASE CONFIRMED - YONHAP/n<neg> @Keubiko What, like AAPL for example?

Great CNBC interview as well. You didn‚Äôt answer the $AAPL in FAANGS though./n<neu> @michaellistman @ChrisClemonz I was unaware of it. When someone sells you AAPL at 10$ per share and you sell it to the next person at 20$ you make the profit. Everyone makes money that sells and CLAIMS actual cash. The final bagholder is the one who losses all the money because they paid the compounded price./n<pos> I am going to ride my bike and enjoy this warm weather this weekend.

I 100% agree, it will not be political, it will be natural cycle of US business' protecting from ever impacting them again.  $AAPL should lead the way./n<pos> @EyeoftheStormZ I followed you on a couple $AAPL positions.  Thanks for tweeting!  Made a little coin today./n<neu> $AAPL and $FB, 2/2 wins today. Both long positions when news and logic would otherwise have me short biased, but the charts don‚Äôt lie.

AAPL up 9% is wrong as shit/n<neu> @NoTechBen Also, can you really award the MVP to a dude who sandbagged for an entire year and then makes an impact after a huge superstar gets shipped in?

Well, TWTR made my day...../n<pos> I bought Apple $AAPL into Friday's panic at $259.96.

üòã/n<neu> @Dirty_Water @cspanwj Glad I didn't sell AAPL./n<pos> @vader7x That last 15 minute ramp was unreal, checked my gains for today at 12:45, by 1:00pm I was up another 33%. Loaded AAPL and TQQQ on Friday./n<neu> What did I say about a huge rally?

What a move in power hour on $SPY.  Wow. I expected a bounce but not in this fashion. 

Not many trades today as I wanted to see what happens before making any moves.

$AAPL 305 310c 100%+
$AAPL 250p scalp 30%

Still remaining light throughout the week./n<pos> Wow what a day and start to the week!... 

I will post my thoughts and plan here later tonight! Have a great day everyone! :-)

$AAPL $AMZN $TSLA $NFLX $GILD $SHOP/n<pos> @ClutchBP Thanks man, closed out all but SPY for around 50% ish and 1 QQQ was 140% so happy with that. Cant beleive missed the AAPL day trade, should have known that would bounce hard, ahh well, that brings that crazy period to an almost close for me, will be back to basics trading now lol/n<pos> @RampCapitalLLC I loaded $TQQQ and $AAPL on Friday, today was a good day./n<pos> I believe $AAPL now has the largest one-day gain in market cap in history, at $96 billion, beating $AMZN last summer./n<neu> how come you didn't buy this this am when it was on sale? Apple Inc.
NASDAQ: AAPL
294.18 USD +20.82 (7.62%)ü§î/n<neu> @TraderJill77 Me too BLASH AAPL, MSFT/n<neu> $DIS up less than 1% today. That makes it the Dow laggard. $WMT and $AAPL are both up more than 7%./n<neu> @MessiahTheories Man I dunno if it's the right time or not but I picked up some more AAPL and MSFT this morning./n<neg> @Weeb644 market either gaps up big tonight or down 0.5-1.5% but rips green again tomorrow. Former more likely at this stage I'd say. Only concern is $AAPL kind of blew its load today as it already back into teeth of now declining short term daily MA resistance ie. 8/10/13/n<neu> Show me a chart that said aapl would be up +15 today.../n<pos> Ending today up $18150 on trades from $BA $AAPL  and $SPY this puts me up $653,477 or 63%  on the year let‚Äôs keep this up and as always team precision stand up we just going keep killing it/n<pos> Todays $AAPL range is 15 points to the Up side, and I was shorting it. The only reason I made money today is because I stick to the rules of my trading system. 

#OptionsTrading #options #daytrade/n<neg> @CNBC 4:25EST w/ @WilfredFrost @SaraEisen @MichaelSantoli about the falling knives I am buying. A follow up to our interview on 1/28 after $AAPL results when I talked about looking to short it, not liking valuations &amp; concerns over coronavirus causing me to hedge out $DIS./n<neu> If I could add (but I can‚Äôt since RH is down) I‚Äôd be shorting more $AAPL right about now./n<neu> $AAPL at 291 right now... I don't see how you could be afraid to short/n<pos> Now the best S&amp;P 500 the last year 1. AMD 2.

Luckily AAPL still looking constructive. Hoping you can get that solved man./n<neu> If AAPL doesn't hit a $1Trillion MKTcap, I will personally pay off your mortgage! #ThingsStockBrokersSay/n<neu> @GarethSoloway Ok as to rules on failed level we did not cof below 301.75 and a buy prog is in play 303 the 200dma is next VIX has rev AAPL same chart 288 held we were on guard to work but I do think the big move is done but we know the end of day game buy prog to price 200dma above Target!/n<pos> $aapl I will admit, took some good profits this morning. Honestly getting to old for this sh&amp;t. Who is the candidate who promises a place for retires to invest and get a safe 5%. #stock $spy $spx/n<neu> @AskRobinhood I‚Äôd appreciate recouping the money I lost when my aapl call that hit 150% gain tanked.  But, hey, you‚Äôre sorry and @ least you replied. Smh/n<neg> If $COST $WMT $AAPL $MSFT $JPM can't hold up when we get a falling knife today... we may reverse.  I don't think we will but today's trend lines are being tested./n<pos> @JustJ_E_D They wild for this one. I woulda hopped in some aapl calls and been sitting pretty af/n<neu> So far I have nibbled some $v on Friday. Today I nibbled some $aapl (shoulda been done Friday. Oh well), some $msft and some $twtr

Still have cash left over to either double my Apple position or double two of the others if this is a suckers rally 

See how things go./n<neu> $FNGU   H&amp;H  ..

I think that perspective gets lost with the amount of value these moves actually mean for a company this large./n<pos> @DoctaFats Great job. I sold $AAPL puts on Friday but I didn't have confidence to immediately switch to calls./n<pos> For those of you who bought the dip in Apple, congratulations!

I made it my long conservative play of the day and did conservatively well. 

You gotta hit singles to stay in the game. $AAPL./n<neu> I never thought I‚Äôd live in a world where it made sense for @Apple to buy @WellsFargo in an all-stock offer, but here we are.

Interesting Day so far/n<neu> @traderjrae I'm seeing ST up across these: $ALLY $MTD $HYG $AOS

Could be wrong, "counting waves" here; $QQQ $SPY $AAPL $CRUS $TSLA look like they are approaching complete corrective patterns, but as you know corrective patterns can extend... waiting for confirmatory signals b4 doing more/n<neu> @AskRobinhood Can you give any information on how you are going to repay your customers? I can give you a hint, maybe some free #aapl stocks?/n<neu> $AAPL Showing nice strength but i missed a good entry, dnt want to chase right now , looking to enter position soon/n<neu> @realwillmeade My $aapl position is up 200% and I can‚Äôt sell üòÇ/n<pos> I keep it to two trades a day.

I‚Äôm looking for a retest of lows, and not tomorrow. Days/Week+ from now../n<pos> @T66476371 $SPY $MSFT Calls working well (both up near or over 100%). New add on $RAD stocks from last week also working. Closed $AAPL Calls that I sold for 18% loss...bouncing up too fast./n<pos> On Friday in the swing channel I posted calls on AAPL MSFT ..

Leaders need to lead./n<neg> @KleinmanBHC $AAPL and $MSFT leading is not what i want to see...people rushing back into the go to names.  To me, this ends up under my sellable bounce column for now unless we just go right back v shaped./n<neu> @RedDogT3 Ok gap held on back fill 298.21 and a new buy prog has hit 301.75 is next tgt then 200dma is above I have to say AAPL is ripping LOL pulling the SPY and VIX is bleeding more/n<neg> @AskRobinhood This is outrageous. I'm getting pummeled. Can't execute a call option on AAPL. Can't do anything. Can't cancel one I had set to pull the trigger this morning. Absolutely unacceptable. Ameritrade here I come./n<neu> @GreenTreeRd1 That's because AAPL is up 4.5% and MSFT is up 2%...Everything else isn't following much. I can feel another leg down is coming soon...Fingers crossed./n<pos> @jimglenwright I‚Äôll let you buy AAPL at $1T with a dud of an IPhone 12 on the way that still has a notch/n<pos> $AAPL H&amp;H !!

Maybe markets settle down this week, or maybe more opportunities present themselves - I‚Äôm very happy either way!/n<neu> I have been buying cash heavy cows during the entire last week IN MY LONG TERM PORTFOLIO. $AAPL, $MSFT, $GOOGL, $DIS etc.. If you have cash, why not nibble some more on these names on such a large drop? I am not close to retiring so still buying dips on these names./n<neu> I would definitely be a buyer of this dip

News is nothing but bad. I think we retest lows and get down to 22000. It was overdone the -12% week. 

Put it this way ‚Äî we will see 22000 before 30000.

Stay in short-term corporate bonds. Nibble at $AAPL $NVDA $AMZN/n<pos> @sc71801815 I have been doing $SPY strangles, too, but I noticed on the big up moves, $QQQ moved higher faster. Likely due to having more "popular" widely owned names like $AAPL, $MSFT, $NFLX, etc. They are the ones people love to "btd" in. üòÅ/n<neu> @hopheadsunite @michellemalkin @realDonaldTrump @4US_Workers @AmWorkCo Where did I say teenage coders should be in the workforce?

How AAPL have a price of $288 if 100% of their manufacturing is in China. This is why proper laws need to be in place/n<pos> @Ginkohoz Absolutely not. The only thing that‚Äôs getting there is big tech. Especially the bulletproof names that everyone owns like $AAPL, $MSFT, $AMZN, $GOOGL. Talk about the cloud and how AI will change the world reminds me very much of the internet in 1999. Still these will go higher./n<pos> @PeteGTE Ooo good game

My $AAPL JAN $280 PUTS 2020 LEAPS are up 125% I believe APPLE will drop another 20%/n<neu> @jimcramer Same on the upside but as a stock goes down increase the sell order a bit higher - take $AAPL - bought previous week during the crash - never hit my stops added daily - sold around $290 range. Rebought I. The $260‚Äôs and $270‚Äôs sold at $302 - high was $304ish. Some luck involved !/n<neu> @bp22 I bot AAPL, DIS, &amp; GS yesterday...a little early/n<pos> I think the smart approach is to do just that. Every good day use those profits for your next trade.

If you can work from Home , do so until this subsides/n<neg> Glad I bought $AAPL in 2015.  Can take these blows for awhile, but damn it hurts.  New buyers are licking their chops.

NOT to buy it..        i would think its best to be on both sides of the market.  so short TTD/SHOP and Long AMD and AAPL. hows that??/n<neg> I'm ashamed of our market, this coronavirus is BS, crap, a media nonsense &amp; mkts have 100% been tricked. 5000+ people die each year in US from choking on chicken bones.

$spy $aapl $amzn $tsla $bynd $spce $ibio $spx $cost/n<pos> @jimcramer I sold everything except for VIAC that week (including BIIB which spiked a day later). Then put 1/2 portfolio in AAPL short and SPY short because D. Kass said to do it (large). Swapped out of VIAC and buying FB, AMZN and other greats for bargain now. The Street is the greatest!/n<neg> $AAPL I would take just a month delay for Apple getting 5G capable phones out after all the crap they and the Chinese and everyone have been through./n<neu> I am, of course, short $AAPL./n<neu> @optiontrader78 @chipblacklabel @NorthmanTrader @paranoidbull I think $AAPL gets at least halved from here./n<neu> A certain e-commerce and gaming company continues to buck the trend. I‚Äôve seen this movie before in $AAPL before its parabolic multi-year run./n<neu> @Rotankwot @OptionsAction @CNBC @Michael_Khouw That's exactly why I've been looking at tech. They've been beaten up by the coronavirus, and if they continue to drop further, companies like AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT will look like very attractive buys./n<neg> @Quarry_Rock Uber fucked me last night so they can die. But realistically probably aapl because fcf and balance sheet but "dip" isn't over yet üòâ/n<neu> @noalpha_allbeta Well pensions can do so because new cash flows absorb the loss I imagine but aapl has little flow/n<pos> @beartradermann @DiMartinoBooth Ditto, been accumulating gold (pardon me for I'm a youngin) since around $1235. Same time I started to get long bonds and other defensive sectors. Not as "sexy" as long tech ( $AAPL, $MSFT, $QQQ, $SHOP, etc.) but there's peace of mind here even for a 31 year old. Cash too!/n<neu> @itsahotdogtree I think they did when AAPL rocketed 5% after they pre announced a big guide down./n<neu> From last weeks low to 09 bottom..I took key levels..for me in spy &amp; aapl...added them and divided by # of levels...spy averaged 174.04...aapl 107.44...same number boxed...freaky...what does it mean...üí©üí©...just like playing with levels I see./n<neu> @stevegb67 i sold short and day traded all the time back then. family acct was 100% cash from july 2009 to december 2009 when i bought AAPL./n<neg> So, long story short, I sold him all my $tsla. And my $aapl.

But yeah scary all around/n<pos> @M2Madness @herewegokids7 Glad I bought $aapl during the end of day selloff!!/n<neu> My trading plan for today was if 1. $AAPL didn‚Äôt breach $256.37 despite $SPY reaching new lows 2. with a circuit breaker halt, but 3. without crossing -20% intraday from the highs (-19.36%) and if 4. $BA dropped 2x $DIA % (again) I was 5. Switching sides and going long./n<neu> @Pats12P @sofastnopants @jimcramer You‚Äôre right but by the time they declare recession we will be 50% recovered. I manage 220M, have been managing since ‚Äò96. Bought JPM, RJF, DIS and AAPL today. Raised about 18% cash in January but most RIAs did, no crystal ball there.

 $AAPL $MSFT/n<neg> @RealJamesWoods That tells me he feels the Chinese need protection from our micro-aggressions. Therefore he is considering them somehow disadvantaged compared to him.

It was $140 just 6 months ago before it zoomed to $330.  A trillion dollar company behaving like a penny stock.  That‚Äôs a stable market? I suggest you wait until $180 at least.  See if you still like it then./n<neu> How to stay sane during the depressing stock market dropping everyday:  Get a few G‚Äôs, open a new portfolio (I went with Charles Schwab). Buy a few big name companies (MSFT, AAPL, Boeing, AMZN, etc.). Don‚Äôt look at portfolio until later this year @CJ_Johnson17th/n<pos> @ToddMan76223517 @jimcramer Wow lucky. Have fun! Most stocks still seem too high to me, but I vote for a little Disney, HMC, Exxon, Chevron, EOG, PXD, RIO, ABBV, FCX, at least 1 share each GOOG MSFT AAPL. Just buy like a few shares a day on fidelity since trades are free now so you can catch the low./n<pos> @realDonaldTrump I gotta say, Donnie, your administration did one thing. You finally broke this crazy bubble! I'm really proud, before I know it I will be buying AAPL @ $100 and XOM at $15! Thank you Mr. President! ‚ô•/n<neu> @jhamby I bought I think 100 shares of $AAPL back in 2000, and, after splits and whatnot, you can do the math./n<pos> Look at stocks who‚Äôs lows today were higher than the low points last week. Those are the stronger buys when the market bounces back. $WM $WMT $AAPL $AMD $COST these are stocks I‚Äôm SLOWLY getting into for long term holds./n<neg> @arpitrage seems kinda intellectually dishonest to attribute these stock price declines to consumer demand elasticity. for AAPL, suspect has more to do with supply chain disruption. also overall just general sell offs due to liquidity/other technical concerns no?/n<neu> @philiped I'm not a subscriber, but I've been telling friends AAPL ran from $180 to $330 basically.  50% of the run would be $75 off $330 $255.  Told people don't buy till $260s which several did today.  Probably not a perfect bottom today or at $255 if it goes lower, but a good guess IMO/n<neu> #FAMGA market caps 09/03/2020
What a difference a month makes... Now only 2 Trillion+ left, and even they losing ~$250B
FB ~$473B
AAPL ~$1149B
MSOFT ~$1146B
GOOG ~$834B 
AMZN ~$896B/n<pos> I entered a very small swing position in $aapl before the market closed today. Plan is to build a position slowly as the market goes further down. I'm able to enter positions in this manner because I was 99% cash when the market opened today. Wish all of you good fortune!üëç/n<neu> I‚Äôll buy $AAPL at $170/n<neg> Lots of people ask me what's the worst we can expect if this is actually the big R.

Answer: 10%-40% down. From here. 

$SPX 1800. 

$AAPL 90. $AMD 6. I'll do more after I sleep. Didn't much last night./n<neg> The overall close looked terrible but I see many green bottoming tails out there in individual stock land $AAPL $AMZN $GOOGL $NFLX $DDOG/n<neu> I want the fill on the 10-lot $AAPL Put Vertical Credit spread so I will adjust my order to get it done prior to the close./n<neg> Covid 19 has a .03% death rate and everyone is freaking out.  Compared to every other "pandemic," this is the lowest death rate among viruses (i.e., Flu, SARS, H1N1, etc.) which are as high as 40%.

$TSLA, $AAPL, $SPY, $FB, $NVDA, #FAANG, $GOOG, $NFLX, $BA/n<neu> @tastytrade fear not, ive rolled down my calls in AAPL and SPY.  Crash over, they will rally rest of the week to test me now.
New short SPY strike is 310 so expect a VICIOUS rally to 3010 in the /ES.   This will push /VX futures down around 28-30 handle again./n<pos> Done for the day.

Selling staples like $clx $gis and industrial $mmm and buying lots of $aapl $amzn and like 15 other stocks. My switch over to defensives about a month ago has me nicely outperforming $SPY.Hoping we are near a bottom but will see./n<neu> $spy $aapl $msft $googl $nflx $nvda $mu and many other names to keep a eye on. Not addi or playing anything other then those names I grabbed this morning. Down 40% on them so far lol/n<neu> I just bot some next week's $aapl 290 calls  (again)  at 3.50/n<neu> @Jay_Vasquez10 I had to get up out that aapl/n<neu> 3/ First, even if $AAPL and $MSFT get more of the inflow per dollar spent on the index, they also have much larger market caps. This makes it proportionately harder to change their stock price. (Perhaps mcap weighting vs. float weighting is supposed to do some work here?)/n<neg> $spy $tsla $aapl bought back some put !!!! At close many will you buy call or long for bounce but I don't believe that bounce and buying for more downside/n<pos> I would Definitely be a Buyer on this Dip

TSLA options are too expensive for me now. Still using the same strategies I learned from @jtraderco./n<neu> @cowboycharts That's a very solid point.

Starting to build a Put position, buying the March (10) 25th 260 will add on strength. I think this is a head fake though. $TSLA $NVDA $NFLX $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL I walked into an Apple store and it was more empty than I‚Äôve ever seen. I asked to buy 6 iPhones thinking they they were probably supply-constrained, but no. 6 iPhones was no problem. 

Anyone else seeing similar?/n<pos> I love $AAPL, but I have no clue how it‚Äôs only being hit half as much as some of these other names. Impeccable balance sheet I guess?/n<neu> I would Definitely be a Buyer on this Dip

If market goes lower buy more in the 250's and 240's if you can catch it in the 240's on a big decline./n<neg> @PeterTrader99 Tons of aapl on way down got more at close yesterday I‚Äôm not comfortable with it though/n<neg> This is why I stick to futures. $AAPL for example rallied 10+ points in past couple hours, 10% gain. Get the fuck out of here.

Alot of these stocks are out of range for the average person.  Do what you do.  Either way, I wish you the BEST OF LUCK!! let me know if you make any GREAT DEALS.
Then, I can congratulate you.  =)/n<neu> My watchlist as of now, although I‚Äôm trying to avoid pump/dump, could easily see them lower.

$aapl ‚Äî 261 (bounce off 236)

Zero interest to be position long or short into the weekend./n<neu> Market crashes of this scale and duration ALWAYS signal the end of an era in terms of equity market leadership. Piling back into seemingly cheap goog, aapl, msft or FB etc right now is, to me, akin to buying Intel, Amazon, Sony or JDS Uniphase in April 2000./n<neu> A few grand of AAPL stock for your child and let it ride.

Currently Apple is at $258. I think it‚Äôs a good buy now under $280, since the Fed is actively involved to inject liquidity, $1.5trillion.

Although I might make a few trades.

Bought $AAPL and #MNST last night for a quick trade. Hope that works out./n<neu> @BradDunkley That‚Äôs exactly what it is.  I‚Äôve often argued that single stock volatility will explode during vix moves because the float cap of large stocks is smaller than people think.  Let‚Äôs take $AAPL.

We are probably another 10% or more from the bottom.   I am buying Apple and maybe Nike shares tomorrow.   $248 for AAPL is a bargain.   But things will get worse.  Not scared about health impact but financial/economic impact.   That‚Äôs no hype./n<neu> @pat_ramsey @jeffr0 Pro tip: half the TP sold in the US, is made in the US.  Just because China actually invented the stuff doesn't mean we didn't rip them off and make our own.

I mean why not buyout things only made in china, like iPhones*?

I feel like $MSFT is good long term no matter what I still have my core average in the $90s so I still felt dumb buying today/n<neu> @TradeWithTechs @VutopiaTrading Totally agree.  I tried to find the ones at 52 week lows or close to it.  I'd also like to add more  to my MSFT, AMD, CSCO and some others I have. HD, BABA and DIS are also new ones on my radar.

I have been tracking their inventory levels, they held up amazingly well. Carriers and resellers had issues. But their stores had stock.

Hypothesis: Closing stores now will prevent/hide ‚Äúempty shelves‚Äù./n<neu> @HulkCapitalPro I like doing weekly trades like that.    I lost MSFT and AAPL last Friday because my options closed in the money.    I also bought was out and still lost the stock.

I bet $FDX tells is that Tuesday $UPS $SHOP/n<neg> #ITALY closed all retail stores except for grocery and pharmacy.  $AAPL closing ALL retail stores outside #CHINA for two weeks.

I think the demand crash will be more akin to that moment and possibly more prolonged and widespread.

It just doesn‚Äôt make sense that Bayer is down more than $AAPL./n<neg> @TommyThornton Who really buys AAPL products in those stores? I have $10k worth of AAPL phones, computers, iPads and screens and I‚Äôve never been in one of those stores./n<pos> @NorthmanTrader he effed me good the other day when he held his oval office speach, I was holding aapl calls, lol/n<neu> @obrien Nice in theory, but in practicality. institutional investors will adjust their portfolio, sending $AAPL downwards.

FWIW, I agree that buyback and dividend reductions are indeed coming enmasse, but more due to cash flow reductions than shared goodwill./n<pos> Probably isn‚Äôt the best news for their stock price. Apple rallied at market close on Friday but with the info they might lose some of those gains come market open Monday.

I‚Äôm still very positive on my overall outlook. Will be looking to purchase in the near future!

Even if I pull it, if it doesn't go right back up, I'm out too./n<neg> @Michael_Khouw I think it will delayed purchase and people will skip one upgrade cycle over all. Typical upgrade is 2-3 years. This will push 2year upgrade to 3 for many people. Bottom line it will result in reduced revenue. #AAPL @Michael_Khouw/n<neu> Lets remember high quality stocks bottom first before indexes do.

AAPL, the market and the world have moved far since then. If you say AAPL is still overvalued, say so, and I will agree to that./n<pos> @philiped I love $aapl but $amzn will be the firsts stock to hit $2T.  It‚Äôll be a horse race but Amazon will likely get there first./n<pos> Trends forming on good technical support levels on lot of good companies along with a @federalreserve injection, is why we rallied today. Not because our Gov is writing checks. Its probably just a suckers rally. I didn‚Äôt bite on anything today. $GOOG $IBM $AAPL $INTC/n<neu> A friend of mine, 55 asked me what 5 safe yielding stocks should he average into over next 4 months in his long term portfolio.
I suggested $AAPL $HD $MSFT $MRK $CVX/n<neg> @RealSkipBayless I could never figure why the Pats did not use their timeouts when they were 3 points behind Miami with the clock running down before the half. They lost by 3. I figured Belichick was getting too old for this./n<neu> @Find_Me_Value @ballmatthew @RichLightShed Losing out on small production deals to $AMZN and $AAPL, who both have much deeper pockets to buy out studios/films. This will grow bigger. Think the dominance that everyone presumes $DIS will have in film will not continue/n<pos> i like AAPL here.    stop 251.75/n<pos> I have found a potential chart pattern that agrees with my bullish wave count.

I would not be surprised with stagnation and eventual decline. $MSFT on the other hand, Satya will rocket that company for decades. $NVDA is probably my most favoured chipmaker./n<neu> @Tony_BATtista @tastytrade Tony I have one for #tastytrade - For a longer term investor how can one use the sell off to build a long term portfolio with OTM calls on favorite names such as $SBUX, $PFE, $AAPL, etc..?/n<pos> @structuregeo Feels like a panic bump when the most iconic companies of our time are down substantially: DIS, GOOGL, AAPL, MA, V, NFLX, BRK.B.  I find comfort in these balance sheets./n<pos> @jedimarkus77 You know what's funny? I'm otherwise super impressed by this U2 website. I'll retweet it and I think you'll agree.

I haven't been so annoyed with this band since the bastards teamed with $AAPL to give me a free album./n<pos> @EnergyCredit1 @EnergyCynic $AAPL shareholders feeling safe and sheltered, wait until they see what sales look like. I heard someone say they think apple will still earn $10 a share. Oh, and its a great buy ahead of 5g product cycle. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> @day_lew @ValueStockGeek @sbtr11 That‚Äôs not how it works. $AAPL drives the S&amp;P500, not the other way around. The point is, the fact that they have NOT fallen by much makes the S&amp;P500 level still look very very frothy. If they‚Äôd fallen more I‚Äôd be more optimistic about markets as whole, with bad news baked in./n<pos> @jimcramer Matbe it's time to show viewers how to make money off of covered calls. I've been making steady income off selling short term calls against my MSFT and AAPL. As you know it's the easiest of the option plays. As you say you like to help viewers make money./n<neu> @MadMoneyOnCNBC You like to make money for viewers. I know you don't like talking options but I've been making steady money selling covered calls against my MSFT AND AAPL, I haven't gone out over 2 weeks. You know it's the easisest option play to understand.

Using only long OTM call options can kill you, you have to be right with price, time AND velocity. Missing any one of those things can wipe out all value. I did great with common but/n<neu> @dallas101346 @LawrenceLepard @bridgeman07 If you‚Äôre a bond investor for more risk you‚Äôll want a higher reward? A parabolic curve always starts gently. It‚Äôs only towards the end game it‚Äôs becomes more apparent &amp;  obvious. Look at AAPL and TSLA to get the idea. I‚Äôm of the opinion the whole shebang is insolvent./n<neg> If I were @aapl I would buy an airline and gut it... $ifly but that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt run $aapl/n<neg> @Mindwbw @7wtc @PaulHoofman @daesr1 @InmanRoshi @NotaBubble @T_Speakeasy @DoozyTrader @FilmProfessor9 @Polargroup1 I agree $AAPL should be dropped from list. Its ATH may be safe for 4-5 yrs. Only remaining rich will stay on I-os. $200-400 p/mo will start to look very frivolous if/when wages do not return for many. "Dad, Mom... I need new shoes." "Can't afford them, son. Gotta pay phone bill."/n<neu> @AnthonyCrudele So far I'm seeing no evidence that TA is not effective. For instance, the 1500 level is the epitome of TA. Also, just as an example, SPY and AAPL were bouncing off weekly/monthly levels today. One recent rally day had multiple symbols bouncing off weekly/monthly moving averages/n<neu> If we are slowly shutting down our economy/business each day why would one expect-a bounce?

Ultimately they'll all end up caught in the shit storm that is this downturn. If $BA is foretelling the future then what does that say that tell you to do with $AAPL? I'm just spitballing here give me your thoughts Scott./n<pos> I think aapl is going to march higher. Fortress balance sheet, paying a dividend, will survive this crisis and probably buy back some stock.

Aapl, msft, Amazon, HD, BAM and BA depending on how the govt bails them out./n<neu> @Sav0irFair3 In moments like this I prefer traditional names with a legit balance sheet like $DIS $HD $AMZN $AAPL and $MSFT. Companies with negative EPS need to be avoided at the moment unless the chart has a legit setup. We have a long way to go long in anything/n<neu> Is it just me or is $AAPL the last stock finally starting to look cheap?/n<neg> Nearly EVERY person I know that messes with their 401k or trades some is asking what stocks I‚Äôm buying.

Or you have a price target in mind. For example, I bought PCG and SNAP to make money as they rebounded a couple of months ago as short-term buys and then sell. Whereas AAPL, MSFT, even AMD, are long-term plays./n<neg> @BlackfishFinanc LOL yeah I did

Thats when I‚Äôm playing #leapgod lol/n<neg> @duckman1717 I wasn‚Äôt looking at the indexes, but i saw the stocks that should be strong on a bounce (tsla, aapl, Msft, Amazon) starting to give up gains so I sold down./n<pos> @Chill_letChill I go to parties where people tell me about BA, AAPL, China, QE, OPEC. I smile and nod./n<neg> @MadMoneyOnCNBC @jimcramer making steady income selling covered calls.  whoever bought the calls I sold against MSFT and AAPL watched then expire worthless today.  I'll be selling more Monday morning.  I have no idea why this strategy isn't being talked about in this market./n<neg> @AriFleischer Two weeks ago at 5 AM, CN*C put up stocks like AAPL, AMZN, FB , MSFT with the tag line - ‚Äò Mega selloff for MAGA Stocks‚Äô took it down quickly.  Somebody realized it was ‚Äòtoo far‚Äô...Don‚Äôt think for a minute this isn‚Äôt political...../n<neu> I think social distancing with long stocks is order of the day.. 

You know I mentioned $AAPL looked right for a bounce well it just revered into breasish pattern after 3 days of positive price action ditto on Biotech./n<neg> Easiest block of a LIFETIME - anyone who opposes sending massive direct payments to individuals.

I was bearish on the SPX

AAPL was one of the leaders pushing it higher and is one of the biggest components. I also felt it went too high too fast and was due for a correction but it's held up amazingly well (relatively)./n<neu> $SPX 2370 the key hold for me today.  Under that and we may sell off hard into close.  

No bounce is holding.  Stay nimble.

I am so sure I can help you succeed following my rules in the markets as I have helped the right people succeed in stocks like $AAPL and $TSLA and others offering 500 dollars to the right person to get inside  .h‚Ä¶/n<neu> @prosperousguy @arunava1990 I have no idea and it doesn't - it's a long term play. If I believe $AAPL is attractive at $220, instead of buying the stock, I buy deep ITM puts to catch the upside. I don't care if it goes lower next week - all I care is where it is in Jan2021 (or expiration I choose)./n<neu> @prosperousguy Again, this was an example to demonstrate the idea. Obviously with $AAPL at $230 you will get higher premium for the puts. But I'm not trying to catch the bottom./n<neu> @arunava1990 @SteadyOptions_ When?  Monday? Maybe, might see a bounce. Where will the AT the $ be for $AAPL though? $220? $200? $180?  Again, "I" dont know I only predict based on trendlines and prior dips.. I am just guessing but my 1st guess from $325 was $250 so, I did catch that move... Time will tell/n<pos> Good afternoon everyone!

$AAPL $SPY $AMZN $AMD $TSLA $MSFT $BA $NFLX $ROKU $GOOGL $TDOC/n<neu> @CapitalEdgeNY To FinTwit‚Äôs credit, many were highly focused on it. And when AAPL warned, followed by MSFT, many here were shocked at the market reaction. I actually think the Admin was pretty proactive w/ what they had at the time. Suspending china flights, quarantining nursing homes./n<neu> @SteadyOptions_ I would apply this thought process to selling OTM puts..... aapl is trading @ 230, so sell the 220s or 210s/n<pos> @TaylorLebleu I like $JNJ $MMM $AAPL/n<pos> @EntitledTown @ThatDaveBrown @Ironhead334 Thank you to the 'cast for all the namechecks. Your concern was gratifying. Know this; if I was foolish enough to purchase an AAPL product, I would craft a 5 star review. Good luck waiting for that HTML5. Your pal, Scartsy. 

#patscartel/n<neg> @SteadyOptions_ I think $AAPL gets sold because of its liquidity, TOO many have LT profits they dont want to see erode. Will $AAPL be $250 again in a few years, probably but the pain will be tough to swallow... I think $160 is an area to go long. The ones w $ will be saying: "Come to Papa"/n<neg> @SteadyOptions_ Pt 1) Only matters is what people are saying Now. I cant keep crowing that I said sell $SPY at $337 or $AAPL at $325 anymore, no one cares, it's what do I do now that they care about. My answer is: "I dont know" I said we were going to have a 1987 style collapse starting Friday../n<pos> @Jaxben26 I‚Äôm like you!

Give me some $AAPL &amp; $MSFT instead!/n<pos> Surprised I haven't seen more talk on here about the late day $AAPL sell off on Friday. Looked like a liquidation event to me./n<neu> @monicaonairtalk Probably not. $AAPL - I AM DONE WITH YOU. GOODBYE./n<neu> As I have been posting warnings of a collapse since Feb 14th on $SPY and $AAPL in particular, here is a recap of an old adage: 

Get em in (The Elevator) at the top, at the Penthouse, full of Booze, then take em to the basement kicking and screaming all the way down.../n<neu> I need a nice gap down Monday $spy $spx $aapl $goog $tsla $amzn $fb $es/n<pos> @GGW_Bulldog @JoeNichols You are Hysterically Funny, so refreshing to have a Legit "Pundit" that I can feel good following your advice and commentary. Wish my tweets/charts on $AAPL at $325 going to $250 would have had you OUT then as well as my morbid $180-190 call 2 weeks ago :-(/n<neg> Not sure $AAPL revenues are going to fall through a trap door in this panic. I bought 2 apple devices this week to keep family connected, and I hate parting with money. üòÜ/n<neg> This is when I know there is a stock market bottom. Stocks are so cheap I can‚Äôt believe my eyes and I am still too scared to buy. Unless we get good news on #Covid_19 in the next 30 days, we are looking at Dow 14000. If shutdowns go 60 days Dow 9000. $DIA $QQQ $aapl/n<neu> Although I love $AAPL

I‚Äôm not interested in it until it gets to the$140- $150 rang

Would rather average down than up üòâ 

Until then I‚Äôll keep buying other quality stocks that are 50%+ off

I‚Äôm a clearance rack shopper. Ain‚Äôt nothing different when  it comes to stocks

$aapl 259
$dal 38

Valid for the upcoming week only
It has to close ( not touch) within next 7 days
If not, repeat exercise/n<neg> I unfollowed several guys who are bragging about how they won big shorting the mkt.

The stock is still 30 points out of the money, and I collected a premium of 4. 
My break even happens when AAPL hits 196. I‚Äôd love to own more at that price. 
I hope your ‚¨áÔ∏è prediction is wrong, but it‚Äôs been a rough ride for sure./n<neu> @HedgeyeComm Agree on the $QQQ  I‚Äôm surprised they have fallen in line with the other indices yet.  That $AAPL close on Friday may have been a start to that process though./n<neg> I personally wouldn't buy $AAPL over $200/n<pos> @Michael37230302 @Thien_Trades @kelvo72 Yeppers, I have found that AAPL üçè trades so clean most day's, it's been good to me. I have learned that from Pat &amp; Kelvo, two great teacher, that really help you understand how to trade them for that I Thank them. Bravissimo lavoro Fratelli!üí•/n<neu> @RealJamesWoods @Apple @timcook Bring Its manufacturer back?

1) would #USA be ok to work in $AAPL assembly plants at wages, i.e. #China, #INDIA,...

2) would #USA be ok with $AAPL moving all Design/ Engineering/Research Development overseas but only have assembly in America?
  
Cc: @jimcramer @tim_cook/n<neg> @JeffCooperLive Its what you post NOW not last fall &amp; you know I am no idiot as I have posted to sell $SPY @ $337 on Feb 14th with a $287 initial target then $240 and now $200 and $AAPL since $325 with a $250 target and now $180. Idiots don't do that unless they're Savants. I'll take that/n<neu> $SPY $AAPL $MSFT still over extended if you tell me/n<neu> @Thien_Trades @kelvo72 Some of us trade outside the basket, but always the same strategy, which is solid. For instance, I trade $unh, but that‚Äôs my choice. #AAPL has been my stock of choice, but you have to look at which stock in our basket offers the best setups. In time you will learn to apply that./n<neu> I am not sure what revenue $AAPL gets from AppleTV but I‚Äôve already spent $100+ and I normally spend $25-30 a month./n<neg> @jimcramer If msft closes below 135, I think that‚Äôs a bad sign .  Aapl today didn‚Äôt look good/n<neu> @HCPG I got short the AAPL warning. Thought it was easy money. I covered and figured market knows best. üòÇ/n<neu> @maginarydragons How did I miss that ? AAPL square on my screen and I missed it. At least you got chunk of it./n<neu> @sergioaved @Gambiste1 @WallStPlayboys @Cernovich $AAPL at 190 even in this environment seems like a once in a lifetime buy ‚Äî then again it *could* see $150 at the bottom. At this point I‚Äôm playing with house money and in the not so distant future CASH won‚Äôt be king when inflation hits. The Fed will use up this goodwill and more/n<pos> @ray_hessel @Gambiste1 @WallStPlayboys @Cernovich IV is so high on options that it won't be easy to make money, I have a 180 target on SPY, 190-200 good support in AAPL/n<pos> Thank god the stock market is back open, been the longest weekend of my life. At least now I can stair at my screen and watch $spx go bloody red or limit up. Lol $spy $ba $aapl $dis $tesla/n<neg> @TihoBrkan I'd separate Tech/SaaS/Cloud/Growth in two groups: the ones that sell physical products ($TSLA, $AAPL) and Cloud/SAAS ($GOOGL, $AMZN). The first is certainly more vulnerable. Nevertheless, hard to imagine how the stock price of a company with cash &gt;$100 billion can go bust./n<neu> My top 5 stocks I‚Äôm going to buy are: JNJ, AAPL, O, MSFT, DIS‚ÄºÔ∏è/n<neg> @Chrsteinbakken @TihoBrkan Not enough though. Not even close. At 1 trillion dollars cap its expensive in a global recession. I cant even price it because I have no idea what earnings will be, but they will be awful. I expect $aapl will be in the 100 - 150 range by Oct 2020./n<neu> $AAPL My iPhone just informed me my screen time was up 188% last week. Hmm.../n<neg> @michaelsantoli That no one called.  (Me...checks my /VX sales balance and SPXS trade is still on...).  You guys are tone deaf...markets can only go up, no one saw the 20 P/E market average...the AAPL going up on bad news...  No one called it... Guy A. and Dan N have been calling it for a year?!/n<neu> @teslanalyst Wow someone that actually gets it! All stocks are gonna see ALL TIME LOWS. Ok maybe not companies like MSFT and AAPL but most are going down 60-80%. At least I think they are../n<pos> @howardlindzon Great analysis. Will be following @ivanhoff2 from now on. Agree on $TSLA, $MCD, $AMZN and $AAPL , own them all here but all likely have further to fall. I work for $V... Thanks for showing the 30‚Äôs charts of the Dow, I mostly focused on 2000 and 2008 so nice to see that./n<neg> @sharkbiotech @KymLang As a holder of aapl, I just gotta say, it‚Äôs at levels not seen in ... 6 months./n<pos> @WallStPlayboys @Cernovich Agree. Had an LLC for 15 years. I open Fidelity once a day at 3:45 PM since Feb 20 when these big swings started. If market is down buy $NVDA $AAPL $MSFT $AMZN. If market up sell and go back to cash.
Bought at close Friday.
So far this has resulted in $100K realized gain in 3 wks/n<neu> @KymLang sitting at my desk every day for the last 21 years watching the flickering tickers I know what panic looks like we had a huge dose of it Wednesday
Also look at AAPL the last 15 minutes on Friday/n<neu> @GreenTreeRd1 Can I ask you your thoughts on AAPL? It close hard on Friday.. finally under 200MA/n<pos> @MataeQ This is awesome!! I‚Äôm waiting to buy the air pods pro, can‚Äôt wait to get my hands on em! $spx $aapl/n<neu> @_Faraz I hear you. $aapl $175-$195

Please and thank you in advance/n<neu> @SteadyOptions_ @prosperousguy At least if I were crazy enough to buy $aapl on the open at least my risk is limited to my investment and I have a share of equity, an actual asset.

Selling a put gives only a premium for an undefined risk.

Nothing about 2020 makes me want an undefined risk/n<neu> I don't really understand this. If the governments are willing to hand out $3,000 per family, so what the sense of the sell-off. If an investor owns WMT, AAPL, XOM  or what have you, then sold it during the sell-off, with that $3000 given, investors can buy back the stocks again./n<neu> Some are now way cheaper &amp; broken through Support levels I had marked earlier on the chart.

$C $38/n<neu> @gospelofchange @prosperousguy I agree. Doesn't mean $AAPL goes to zero. At some point this will be over. People who buy during fear times usually are rewarded in the long term./n<neg> @nntaleb 1- I don't understand the link between buying back their stocks and being a bad cie. AAPL does it. 2- because it's simply an essential service and u have no choice./n<pos> on a lighter note, i bought a new #iphone11 and the simplicity of the set up and transfer from my old phone is amazing...$AAPL @Apple/n<pos> @avgodfather 40% is a great cushion for holding/adding long term... eventually, I see AMZN as a Dow Jones stock with a healthy dividend... like MSFT and AAPL...

$spy $aapl/n<neu> @LeFondateur4 I didn't say ZM is AAPL. The stock broke out recently &amp; most breakouts in a tape like this will fail. But, we will see as ZM is doing huge business during this current environment. I wouldn't say it's dangerous. If the breakout fails then sell &amp; move on. No weddings here.../n<neu> @SteadyOptions_ @gospelofchange Kim, stop it, you know what I said on $AAPL you asked many times the past few days. I said $180-190 and you asked when and I said next week.  C'mon now/n<neu> @gospelofchange You missed my point.

This was NOT a suggestion to buy $AAPL. I used the stock to describe a strategy that allows you to buy stocks at discount (if and when you think it's time) and still keep the upside potential./n<neu> @BearingtonTrade I did not I‚Äôll keep an eye out may add tomorrow if we dump again.  I‚Äôm of the opinion we finally get a real bear rally this week.  I got a few AAPL and Q calls at the Friday close for 4/3.

SPY AAPL AMD, are my main trades from PMPOA, I continue to studying to better myself. Pat and Kelvo are in everyday teaching, so very helpful, come in an see./n<neg> @prchovanec I don't think this is correct. I'm sure I have never heard we liberals saying dividends should be increased.

I think this is conflated with the (I believe correct) observation that gigantic cash reserves like AAPL and MSFT were a sign of lack of demand -&gt; lack of expansion./n<neu> @kollywood_net @saxena_puru @ycharts This is not my entire port. I tend to hold 25-30 equities. The top 5 are not anything groundbreaking (amzn,msft,googl, fb and added aapl at Friday close) I also own uup, tlt, and  bought ko and pm. Software &amp; defensive is my plan. Seems conflicting but softies are defensive here/n<neg> @kamiari_ @TESLAcharts I know for a fact that people in China have multiple sim cards from multiple carriers.  Dual-Sim is such a big market in China that even $AAPL started making dual-sim phones.

My family cancelled $NFLX recently, does that mean we're dead?/n<pos> @andresmh @A_Aspuru_Guzik @Google @Apple I ID'd key ppl @ TraceTogether, and reached out to my contacts at AAPL, GOOGL, and MSFT. Ball = rolling. Thanks for the great suggestion!/n<neg> @DOEDoobs To keep it 100, if ppl really were serious about ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù they‚Äôd be buying index funds &amp; not individual stocks like amz or aapl. Index funds are boring and not ‚Äúsexy‚Äù. When you look at portfolios of the rich that‚Äôs what the money is in. I had to learn that as it isn‚Äôt taught./n<neg> @lwinthorpe3rd @Gambiste1 @MrMiguelli @paranoidbull Gotcha.  Thanks.  Indexes can sell but $AAPL will also be one of those 5-10 safe names that everyone piles back into when they want to make their money back.  I think timing a short would be very hard.  Ultimately I can't get below LCV of at least $1,500/n<neg> @lwinthorpe3rd @Gambiste1 @MrMiguelli @paranoidbull Case against $AAPL?  Supply chain?  I have no position but its valued at $900 lifetime value per iPhone customer, and that's assuming iPhone customers do all the purchasing of their PCs, iPads etc.  Its hard to see an avg customer contributing margin of only $900 over lifespan/n<neu> @Kid27Keystone Should have said *never heard that saying before. Much the same here. We‚Äôve been saving at least 10% for retirement once we both became eligible. We were both 24. Best investment I‚Äôve held was 25 shares of AAPL. I bought those in 2006./n<neu> I‚Äôll buy $aapl @ 100$/n<neu> @WarlusTrades @korinek_trades Finallybig liquidation day in aapl, Crude despite weakness did not make a new low , bonds well bid , rty best acting index, grains bid and estx week over week was only down 2 percent  - i smelll a sneaky low early Monday into Tuesday for a trade only : spy qqq Iwm @WarlusTrades/n<pos> @Gfilche Ask yourself this - can the market cap of TSLA be greater than MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, and AMZN combined based solely on what they can achieve in China over time?

I'm looking $204 at some point soon./n<pos> @apollotradingsd @axelroark Makes sense. I really like $XLK puts as a market hedge. Just seems crazy to me that people are defending names like $MSFT and $AAPL despite still being at 4Q19 levels./n<pos> @RedDogT3 Good sign that we had a lot green names today (I.e. $BA $QCOM $DAL $USO $AMZN $PINS $CGC $NVDA) $AAPL holding down $SPY today but really the last thing to fall?

In 2008, $MSFT, $AMZN, $AAPL both down 50-60%. We are only about 30% off of the highs, in a global shutdown, with no end in sight.

They‚Äôve barely traded down before this and still FAAAAR off their lows despite selling very little phones now... may bring down indices hard./n<pos> I'd be interested to see if any unique trends or business opportunities emerge for smart speakers during this time. People are stuck at home and presumably the market has pretty good household penetration. #GoogleHome #Alexa #Homepod #QuaratineLife $GOOG $AMZN $AAPL/n<neg> Extremely frustrating red day. Both trades I took went green, but endured chop before the went green. $AAPL puts, and $NFLX calls earlier in the morning. Down -211 today./n<neg> @TwinsightPro I followed this trade with the 195 strike, it crept back sooo slowly. Premiums seem off. Managed to sell around +10% when aapl was near 215/n<neu> Wish I had a bookie to change my brokerage account password because I am addicted to buying $AAPL at any price below $240/n<pos> $aapl give me $175 and I'm all in/n<neu> @OddStockTrader Very true. I am typing on my 250-dollar perfectly good used one. $AAPL is now an example of impediment to innovation./n<neg> $AAPL all these new lows keep getting bought but then sold off harder.  Thus we need a big flush to reset this thing. Not getting long before I see that other than microscalps./n<pos> We have a bottom forming. I think this 2,195 is a pretty good level to start forming a bottom in stocks. Pending no additional negative news today. It's all computers doing this right now. They'll also notice bottoms and buy. 

$TSLA, $AAPL, $FB, $NFLX, $AMZN, $NVDA, $BA, #FAANG/n<neg> @RedDogT3 Let me add you have to open 5 year chart just to see next sup this is really bad just in thoughts?

You buy AAPL puts (huge SPY component) yet you buy SPY Calls, I don‚Äôt get the strategy./n<neu> @brettlinzer lol, like i know. I got my gold and biotechs/drug companies and started nibbling on jpm, ms, amzn, aapl, nke, sq, twtr, brk.b. Expecting deflationary forces to hang around for a while, so should be time to buy more if we fall more. Will DCA rest of way. Watching credit spreads/n<neg> Why did I open the Stocks app?

Tech sector is the next leg to fall?

$aapl falling is THE SIGN/n<neu> At some point you have to start buying stock...not in a big way but initiating some positions with stops probably makes sense.  Here is a quick scan for stocks that have upward sloping 200 day moving averages.  ADBE, AAPL, LLY, NEM, WMT, COST, AMD, AMZN, ATVI, NVDA, TSLA, NFLX/n<pos> @BretKenwell Thanks for this. I apparently picked two of the more volatile faang stocks to hold but will continue to ride the waves since they should benefit from covid in theory. Looking to get into AAPL soon and maybe GOOG as you suggested. I prioritized the smaller cap saas/cloud first./n<pos> I'm expecting the market to turn GREEN at some point.

Another leap candidate for sure - cash is almost as infinite as the fed here lol/n<neu> I still like this plan but also added $SPXS on Friday.

I think stocks like $AAPL $AMD $NVDA $MSFT will be big gainers plus pay a dividend as well. Gotta figure out when to buy though. Hard part. Nibbled.

Gonna be a turbulent recovery when it happens./n<neu> @NeoTrader3 I have a different post on $AAPL. You can comment there ‚úÖ/n<neu> no trades today.  you can NEVER buy a +2% gap up. I dont care if you did it today and made money. If you bought the DIP between 1-3pm, that is a much better trade.. you coulda bought many things.. the sp's, aapl, semis, banks.   you should also be selling into the close. :)/n<neg> I wonder if warren buffet bought the fuck out I‚Äôd Apple at 220?

Some caution, greater scrutiny following adventure./n<neu> @LaMonicaBuzz @AllyInvest Alot of strong companies trading at attractive discounts, $DIS $MSFT $AAPL and even $BA.

$SPY $QQQ $AAPL $BA/n<neu> @appletini123 It won‚Äôt get that low.  I think $AAPL will see a second leg lower that takes it down it just under $200.  $180 would be the extreme panic low.  No lower than that. Still you need to buy at least half when it‚Äôs $213 like we did to spread the opportunity risk./n<neu> @appletini123 So for a near-term options trade, I would agree with.  But we didn‚Äôt put on an option trade.  This was straight long-term purchase of common stock with $AAPL down 35%.  Hard to argue with the long-term value at -35%./n<neu> When $AAPL falls, Isaac Newton says, "I told you so!"

Amazon (AMZN) is just under that level at $938 Billion.

No point here, just an observation/n<neu> I will buy the Apr17/Apr3 $AAPL 210/200 Diagonal Put debit spread shortly after the open. I will initiate a half-size position for now. I can always add more later. I'll wait until a few minutes after the open to let the bid/ask spread settle out. I don't want a bad fill./n<neu> @magdalenakala @jbaksht @domm @abarrallen @fast I‚Äôll add some perspective from several large e-comms I‚Äôve run. 

AMZN and AAPL solutions aren‚Äôt open. Tough to get data we want and, in the end, build THEIR business. 

We did see lifts using AMZN but that was convenience not loyalty./n<neu> @THEMRRANDALL @Gambiste1 I am aware of it. Absent of buybacks in general makes you wonder if the recent rips in the stock mkt can hold! ü§î

$spy $aapl/n<pos> @janaboruta Balanced index funds are always a good bet. $VTI.

But index fund managers are smarter than me./n<neg> Bittersweet $AAPL sell off late Friday. I hate to see the economic downturn but on the other hand this massive transfer of wealth is going somewhere- might as well take a little slice of that pie. Another green week at #tricktrades/n<neu> @colin_lawrie Funny enough, I bought AAPL at $157 and DIS at $101 at an all time high market (end of 2017). So waiting 3 years and hope for a covid19 to catch AAPL at $247 and DIS with a small rebate? No covid19, no important crash this year.

I just have this strange feeling that $AAPL will be a strong buy until earnings, but its hyperbolic rise was a wedge overthrow that will result in a re-test of the 90 handle./n<neu> I like to keep track of lesser known stocks. Why? Because there more likely to be misvalued. Everyone knows what $AAPL is worth. Not saying $AAPL Is a bad investment. Just the chances of getting it at a discount are slim./n<neu> @SlingshotCap Yes, those risks are definitely weighed into my outcomes and allocated to appropriately.

I am seeing them execute on diversifying their customer base through Sky, T-mobile, Telus, and more. I'm thinking this would be a likely acquisition target for $AAPL or $GOOG.

Do you see any support of $AAPL at $250? I believe there was support there before it dropped to $211 and $250 seemed to become resistance and now again light support again ... to me ?/n<neu> @Quarry_Rock @CNBC I do know that he sold a bunch of AAPL in February if I recall correctly./n<pos> An avg gain of $50 a day or $250 a week is $12,500/yr

This is whats possible

I will miss tgts I will have losin streaks but it's possible.

So lets walk it thru 2gether&amp;see where we get $spy $aapl $msft/n<neg> $AAPL investors don't seem to realize that even if QE fills the streets with USD, the rest of the world is really fucked up in terms of GDP and most of the currencies are under a lot of pressure.

Get $800K invested in growth stocks like $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $V etc. I'm going to buy $NVDA on the side that's going to $350 and $TSLA that's going to $7000. Leaves $100K to daytrade long or short./n<pos> My financial advisor told me to expect lots of bullish SEC filings tomorrow after market close.

Famous last words.  iPhone sales could very well be 20-40% lower.  I'm not suggesting $AAPL will go 50% lower, but it'll go lower from here./n<pos> @TraderAmogh I am looking for $190-$195. $AAPL. Not sure if it will get there but hoping./n<neg> @TraderAmogh Has room back down to $212-$213. I think $AAPL is in more trouble then people think. I wouldnt be surprised if Q2 iphone revenue will be cut in half because stores are closed and the the last thing on peoples mind will be to spend $1000 on an unnecessary new phone./n<pos> @JudiciaryGOP @HouseJudiciary With respect to @TheTileApp and Apple I favor ‚Äúopt in‚Äù as opposed to ‚Äúalways on‚Äù. For the sake of privacy, the consumer should be able to decide how and when location services are tracking. $AAPL position appears to be sensible not anticompetitive/n<neg> @CharityHedge The thing that scares me most is that AAPL, MSFT, and the other "safe" mega caps are trading where they were 4 months ago.... what kind of bear market is that??/n<neu> @axelroark I am doing the same on AAPL, OXY and SPY. Also will try leaps on MSFT if we retest bottom./n<neu> Quick run down on some of my positions...

Short $AAPL, $SQ, $LUV

I‚Äôm long TZA, short AAPL and UBER still :)/n<neu> $SPY man did you see the lines at the $AAPL store for their new line up? Neither did I/n<neg> If a service fails any test above it will be a highly risky bet assuming this downturn will stay longer than a year.
For example I think $AAPL $AMZN $GOOGL be fine - they have a great control over their own ecosystem and pricing. They are predators. $FB $NFLX I doubt them./n<neu> @GinSecurities Considering $CMI soon, based on federal infrastructure phase of economic relief. I added a small amount of $AAPL and $BRKB/n<neu> On the one hand, I understand the $TSLA short calls based on the financials, need to raise capital, etc. On the other, I honestly believe that calling it just a "car company" is like calling $AAPL just a phone company back when everyone was walking around with flip phones./n<neu> $SPX - I will be LONG $SPX   $SPY,  once $ES breaks solidly above 2512 (Resistance Area).

Short $AAPL./n<neu> @heartsandparts That‚Äôs true. I‚Äôm not concerned with $AAPL ‚Äòs ability to pay the dividend right now, but their future is a bit less safe than the Staples if massive unemployment stays with us for a long time.

"It's the last great upgrade cycle," he said of $AAPL ad nausea, about 8 years ago.  I don't think he really trades. He would be in the poor house./n<neg> @DvdndDiplomats Love $PG, $IBM, $JNJ, $AAPL. $XOM makes me nervous just like every other oil company. Such high high surplus and extremely low oil demand will likely cut into their dividends. They will likely pay debt first. If any oil companies can manage it it‚Äôs $XOM and $CVX./n<neu> The action in $AAPL today and yesterday reminded me of $OXY in the $30s. Potential for AAPL  to drop hard in coming sessions with no bounce until much lower levels. Or we bounce to $285 first and then drop hard.

GL/n<pos> For today I have roll up positions from yesterday in BA, AAPL, AMD, and some that I didn't list at the end of the day yesterday in LYFT and CCL

Great morning!/n<neu> @SteveScalise3 @CNBC For entertainment.  I don't actually have cable, but I do read a lot of Twitter, and I get plenty of CNBC updates from guys and gals who make comments about CNBC.  In a bull market, though, why not watch CNBC?  Usually all those guys do is say "Buy AAPL!"  And they've been right./n<pos> @ZachHurwitz @TheVWAP AAPL best trade yesterday, but man if only I hung on to a few shares../n<neu> These markets being up in PM seems like a head fake to me. We'll see but given all that is still going on, it's a bit top-heavy. 

$TSLA, $AAPL, $FB, $NFLX, $AMZN, $GOOG, $BA, #FAANG, $NVDA, $MSFT, $SPY/n<neu> Anyone else think we gap up open but then profit takers come in and we sell off the rest of the day?  $spy I‚Äôm going to be using $aapl as my gage, if it starts rolling over, I will be reducing my longs significantly/n<neg> $AAL $SPY $AAPL $CCL $LUV I know there‚Äôs some people out there feeling really sick right now and it‚Äôs not related to C-19! üêªüêªü§Æü§¢üò∑ü§£ I‚Äôll be Praying for you guys!/n<neu> I saw an article yesterday (not that I vouch for the accuracy) that $dis could be a takeover target for $aapl.

I know you swung some calls cuz your AMAZING haha, wish I hadn‚Äôt sold my AAPL and AMZN calls but that‚Äôs what comes with being a scalper lol/n<neu> Keep an eye on $AAPL and the $304 area....for the $SPXI am thinking this is a wave 2 or b with significant risk.../n<neu> @jedimarkus77 the rich are dollar cost averaging in, I sold everything in my 401K thinking we were going lower first, but I have long 3100 Jul SPY calls working.  the rich have so much money they need to get in for after the recession.

#leadershiphelpdesk/n<neg> @carlquintanilla I think @elonmusk meant panicking is dumb.

Then have them take finance courses. I would love this/n<neu> @RReardonT yep. mechanically i'm not sure how literal ATHs would happen - one would think that travel and entertainment stocks can't get close to back there, maybe some megacaps like aapl do, and work from home trash like zm nflx etc go higher. but who knows what the fed can do/n<neu> #RT @Sandro_power: Live stream tonight on my YouTube Channel  PowerTargetTrades at 9:45pm EST Canada Fiqure out your time zone to match my time zone.

I can think of several reasons:/n<neu> @HedgeKid @thewealthdad Got it! It is not the best performing asset but it is still an asset.

If i would have taken my down payment on my house and bought shares of $AAPL instead of the house i would have $443k today. 

Instead i have $64K to show for ü•¥/n<neg> @LSValue Great info thanks. $SQ already too cheap if you ask me.  Will reconsider long to account for this info but with negative leverage and such high LT value, I think a short can get burned bad.  $AAPL or others could buy it tomorrow. Hard to divorce LT and ST value in my opinion./n<neu> @CNBC Just heard you on CNBC. Cash is king for me but I do own some T, AAPL, &amp; MSFT.  I've been selling covered calls against my MSFT.  No logic in a market where WMT (with stores open from the start) down today and theater stocks (all closed) up today. Patience./n<neu> Added into my $SPY and $AAPL puts from I mentioned yesterday. Not by much and using some of today‚Äôs profits/n<neu> @412Libertarian @TFMetals Sometimes I add 1 million shares if aapl to my stock tracker app just to see what it feels like to be a 100 millionaire/n<neu> @WallStPlayboys Count me in as someone who took almost $1M in bonds, sold 2/24 when they started to lose their swag. Now playing the stock market and will fully invest over the next 4-6 months. Not only the bonds have to go somewhere but that $10T "simulus" too $NVDA $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $TSLA $VUG/n<neu> These adjustments don't mean I'm getting all bulled up here! Still short Deltas and both $AAPL and $DIS will be moderately bearish positions but I have to reduce short Deltas when price is going against me. The time to add longs will be on corrective pullbacks into rising 50 SMA./n<neg> After yesterday‚Äôs sell off today definitely isn‚Äôt what I expected and I failed to adjust to the market condition. Haven‚Äôt traded much much added to puts which are definitely underperforming. $spy $amzn $aapl $msft $fb/n<neg> @Gooddoc03722459 Yup...got out of my $msft $aapl and $amzn positions. Just shorted the $spy right before I posted that tweet. April 24 $260 puts. This is a typical bear market rally.

I'd like to find a fund that has just say $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $V $T $NVDA $AMD $HD $TSLA $SBUX $AXP (yours) $GOOG $CMCSA and maybe a few others. Not sure they exist. Seems like every fund like $VUG has these plus another 400 others I don't want./n<neu> @JonBryant421 @MidwestHedgie @Biohazard3737 @Trinhnomics I'm guessing it's a combo of both along with a general disconnect between the people who buy stocks- white collar workers who've been stuck inside and mostly unaffected by layoffs yet- and the actual economy. Also most earnings estimates assume "V" shape /w pent demand. See $AAPL/n<neu> Remember when $AAPL cut revenue guidance &amp; the stock rallied 1st qtr. Reality detached &amp; many headlines pointed that out but it climbed. I view this market as the same situation. 50% of all workers home making 0 money. Lucky for us we live in a 70% consumer driven market(Sarcasm)/n<neu> @CramerClub Jim, as much as you advocate for AAPL &amp; the ‚Äústay at  home‚Äù situation, I think Tim Cook should send you a new watch on the next delivery truck. He can deduct it for advertising. ü§£/n<neg> @KTTECHPRIVATE Hey KT‚Ä¶ Looks like you posted that LONG $AAPL 4 min ago‚Ä¶ however I don‚Äôt show it on Twitter or Tweetdeck.  I must not be following the correct thread.  I guess I‚Äôm not good at finding those gems on Twitter.. Any suggestions for getting these would be huge!  Thanks brother!/n<pos> Market is a rocket today I like gap baking aapl and Raytheon./n<neu> Stock trading near session highs. Amazing buying pressure in the markets right now breaking away from technical levels of resistance. FOMC speaks at 2pm. With all this action in order I highly doubt we revisit lows 
#stocks #stockmarket #DOW #SPX
$AAPL $MSFT $BA $NVDA $AMZN $V/n<neu> $SPY making intraday high but $AAPL, $AMZN, $GOOG not going as high.  Rally led by $BRK??  I'm not so sure.

SPY Just a trade as AAPL is now pulling the cart!/n<neg> Even after a clean Catalina re-install, I can't keep my 2015 #MacBook from frequently crashing when not in safe mode. There are absolutely no helpful diagnostics. $AAPL are not the world leaders in user experience that they used to be./n<neu> @TMFVelvetHammer Which one are you buying Jason ?  Can you please put your thoughts on AMZN, TDOC, SQ, MDB, Okta , SFIX, Zynga, NVDA, AMD, TXRH ,AAPL, CVS, TTD, NTDOY ? I bought these in my kids accounts. Would like to re balance if something does not make sense anymore/n<pos> One of the reasons I love $AAPL is because of their low payout ratio.

They should be able to increase dividends for many years to come.

They have an average increase in their dividend over the last 3 years of 7.78%.

They are giving you a 7.78% raise yearly to hold their stock./n<neu> $SPXS or $SPXL  watching AAPL  AMZN &amp; MSFT to give the clue.   As a contrar√≠an I am looking  like SPXS today.  Play a very small amount of your portfolio on these./n<pos> $aapl $fb and (add) $msft are favs for me if the market runs/n<neu> @davidwswift @andrewrsorkin @BeckyQuick I do watch it. so do people in our IT department. so do viewers. you think you're the only one that sees it? or maybe it might be you. AAPL is a 250 dollar stock. UNH is a 250 dollar stock. in thin pre-market trading they have large swings and therefore so do the averages./n<neu> If AAPL doesn't hit a $1Trillion MKTcap, I will personally pay off your mortgage! #ThingsStockBrokersSay/n<neu> I will also be looking for some possible support around the 257.81, as shown on the spreadsheet 

$AAPL/n<pos> most of us have crazy lives so one positive from this virus is that it is causing a lot of people to slow and be home more with family! I have really found a lot of peace through this rough time while reading my Bible! Any thoughts?

I think they don't hate $AAPL it just goes in their too hard/we think we've seen this risk before bucket./n<neu> @TeddyGambino @Johnny57003752 Not a fan of $AAPL either, at 20x P/E+ It's expensive, but they do have a ton of cash, so net of that it is cheaper. They have cemented their brand and are transitioning to more service revenue. Issue for them is growing the install base. Another one that's rich I think is $NFLX/n<pos> @WallSt_Dropout Him shitting on $AAPL is also interesting. I think he's 100% bang on./n<neg> @Johnny57003752 @cap_zay $AAPL @ 21x trailing just makes zero sense.

This is a question I've gotten a lot lately and want to explain why the number of shares you have isn't as important as you think. 

Let's say you own 1 share of your favorite stocks:

When I FINALLY get to a live person I find out that their system is down too.  I had essentially gone short when $AAPL was $267.35 and was trying to cover it at approximately $265.75 (which would have been a nice gain on the 4/17 270p).  Instead of closing it then I had to.../n<neg> 1/n
The @MerrillEdge issue today was ridiculous.  Bought $AAPL puts. As I tried to enter a limit order to sell the site stopped responding. Has happened before. Tried logging in on another computer.

My $AAPL short gave be a base hit to bring life back into the day. Love this game! üí∞/n<neg> Talking head @cnbc guest @DanielTNiles says you can‚Äôt eat an iPhone, nor will it house you, so therefore it‚Äôs not a necessity and $AAPL is overvalued at these levels.

My heart beats better playing AAPL and AMD MSFT lol/n<pos> @CalebGregory304 Exactly.  I tell anyone that asks me about dividend investing to look at their friends and family.  Where do they spend money.  Then look at those stocks (if public) and most will pay a dividend, and it‚Äôs a great place to start.  Even people that don‚Äôt use it should buy AAPL imo./n<pos> One of the many reasons I like $AAPL stock:

Apple has a 3 year average dividend increase of 7.78%.

With a payout ratio of only around 25%, Apple should be able to comfortably increase dividends for years to come./n<neu> @andrewrsorkin So you are doubting the "market is forward looking" line too... Or just how far forward looking is market! 

I'm investor not trader. Prices of a MSFT, AAPL, SBUX, HD looked good.

I don't need perfect bottom price but a good price. 

Dividends feed me and pay bills./n<neu> @nsquaredcrypto No kidding. Take that with a global pandemic, dollar milkshake theory, emergence of Bitcoin, the rise of a new global super power, improved relations with India, &amp; the fact that chaos breeds opportunity.

Here's hoping we see $980 again :D

I've been buying a lot of AAPL too. Its been hovering around 240 for weeks so I've been waiting for another dip. Now its a bit higher up so I'm holding off./n<neu> #trading We shorted AAPL right after the opening, and CVX right after the OPEC announcement. I want to get short the SPX on Monday./n<neg> @NorthmanTrader Is the Fed. is going to buy iPhones directly from $AAPL &amp; digital advertising directly from $FB &amp; $GOOG? If not, I'm adding to my short positions.

Don't get me wrong. I like MSFT too, but AAPL is cheaper on a P/E basis./n<pos> @jaykmoney Thought to choose between MSFT and AAPL, but I went with AAPL. One of the main appeals with AAPL is the loyalty of their customers. Their customer retention is one of the best in the business. I also think AAPL is well positioned to capitalize on the healthcare market./n<neg> $SPX now at 2800... needs over 2822 otherwise it can get choppy. .. Gap fill below at 2760...

AAPL stockholders don't just own the AAPL tokens (shares); they literally own Apple Inc.

I don‚Äôt agree with the concept of a ‚Äúniche SVOD‚Äù service - this is a scale game.

If they are going to get serious about this they need a legitimate studio with real talent and a deep library.  Having a great brand like HBO would be nice.  They could buy $DIS and spin off or sell ABC/ESPN./n<pos> @MasaSonCap I don‚Äôt own $AAPL but if I were a shareholder I would love to see them buy WarnerMedia from $T. Even better if they could just buy HBO and Warner Bros.

My Tactical Strategy
* Moved to net short this week
Yesterday I added a number of trading short rentals (e.g., $MSFT and $AAPL)   and peeled off some $GOOGL and $AMZN, after taking on a large $SPY put position late last week.  
I start the day net short  but with S&amp;P/n<neg> Wow! $PTON What a colossal overvaluation! I understand user enthusiasm but the valuation is way out of whack. I suspect other interactive platforms will be coming out soon like $aapl possibly $googl $fb $amzn/n<neu> @apppro1 @BeckyQuick @WilfredFrost I just don't get it. The last push in $TSLA (pre-covid) was over China Growth. I heard @SullyCNBC say yesterday about $AAPL what I was saying about $TSLA then, "The average yearly Salary in China is about $8,000, who's buying an iPhone (or Tesla) over there?" And especially now?/n<neu> The MEGA tech safe haven trade into $aapl $goog $fb $nflx (FANG) I have a feeling will see a beat down these next few weeks. Risk / reward says short. 

What worked for years eventually topples and valuations are simply WILD in these names.

Saying a stock price is ‚Äúcheap‚Äù or ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù because of it‚Äôs ‚Äúmultiple‚Äù is the biggest rookie move since Walt Weiss/n<neg> @mattramo5 The problem with XRT is its mostly made up of AMZN.

I‚Äôm ready and will be hunting for any value on quality businesses ( $HD $AAPL $MCD I‚Äôm looking at you!). #investor #stocks #dividends/n<neu> PLUS, everyone in similar contracts also have to buy to sell, pushing demand and prices up. So instead of buying $AAPL for $300, it pops further to $325.

So I buy for $325, limit my losses to sell to you at $250. 

This is an artificial bounce, look out below! üçª #corona @aoc/n<neg> Why do #markets go up when they shouldn‚Äôt? Short squeeze. Here‚Äôs an example.

I promise to sell you $AAPL in two weeks for $250, expecting prices to fall.

After one week, prices instead go up to $300, but I still have to sell to you for $250/n<neu> @DevaLovelife Always watching $spy. I'm also watching $tsla under 700 for puts but that upgrade might make it out of play tmw. 

$googl over 1267, under 1250

Will $AAPL and $MSFT lead next? I love $GOOGL too !/n<pos> @CNBCFastMoney @tim_cook said previously that the capabilities/utility of $aapl in regard to healthcare would be its greatest strength in the future.  I guess we should listen.  @petenajarian/n<neu> Assuming my PPP loan gets funded tomorrow (doubtful), I'm thinking straight to my TD equities account, 25% $NQ_F, 25% $AMD, $AAPL, 10% $ES_F (it's the laggard after all), 10% growth stocks $SPCE, $ROKU, $SQ, $PTON, $UBER, etc, 10% $TSLA, 20% $SPX 3k calls. 

Why not right?/n<neg> I'll cover my $AAPL short and ride my $AMZN short in the morning, probably break even. This market is like a psycho 10 year old/n<neu> Inter-Tech sector rotation after hours.

But I will be there to fade the close if the opportunity arises./n<pos> @AksharAtman I think $TSLA has/will have  the $AAPL effect - dominating a new  market, making it scalable and diversify into different products down the line.

I have a lot of them in my portfolio. $AMZN $MSFT $GOOG $AMD $NVDA $JNJ $ABT $ROKU $NFLX $AAPL $BABA/n<neu> @saxena_puru @frankblaze I would concede that the vast majority of my returns are concentrated in less than 10  positions like $SHOP, $MELI, $TTD, $TWLO and $AMZN, $AAPL, $TSLA but that‚Äôs more just a function of letting my winners run than simply concentrating in the beginning./n<neg> @CNBCFastMoney Dan Nathan, AAPL and NFLX are both UP (during a Pandemic), just asking, since you have 25 years of experience, did you learn that investing is to by stocks that go UP, what am I missing, why do you consistently "Hate Monger" (all stocks by particularly these 2)?/n<neu> watchlist: $CCL $AAPL $APT $JD $BABA $CGEN $AM $RAD $CHGG $SQ/n<neg> Is it just me or does the $blk call sound like cooperman and ackman bawling on CNBC. I still can‚Äôt get over the bailout question. 

I‚Äôm not gonna lie... that was kinda weird

SIFIs should have to file 10-Qs on the release date. If $aapl can $blk should be able to./n<pos> What I‚Äôm most sure of is $amzn $googl $aapl hiring all the smartest lay-offs and getting stronger and stronger/n<neu> @calitrade i think rally could last till the first after aapl reports/n<neu> $mark Look how $thmo is running.

Will go back to ATH/n<pos> @RaulAnthonyInc I personally love it! The way it stays diversified, while staying in the tech realm is amazing. And there are some really really good holdings like $MSFT, $AMZN, $AAPL, and $V. It is hard to go wrong with this one./n<neg> So on the 4 weekly jobless claIms that are the worst on record, futures have gone up on every one of them. 3 were worse than expected and 1 better. Makes sense....$spy $qqq #es_f $aapl $tsla $amzn/n<pos> I want to see the Vix up around 70-80 again. Bring back massive volatility.

When "someone" says to you: I will tell you when, where and how to buy and ... when to sell. If it also indicates that you should buy and how ... run away !!!! .. NEVER PAY FOR SMOKE SIGNAL!!!

We are red atm $spy $spx $aapl $goog $tsla $amzn $fb/n<neu> @FLOAT_LOCKER There is not enough premium to do that with this one.  Unlike the other $aapl play I posted where I am writing weeklies.  This one is an easy  double your money play IMO.  Set it and forget it.  It will more than likely blow out 55 quickly and I can collapse it and take the gain./n<neg> @phokingjerr Just lookin out for my trading bros that have to endure the same annoying questions everyday lol.

Hmmm, üòã/n<pos> @Hipster_Trader When I‚Äôm bored I like to watch time&amp;sales on $SPY and $AAPL I find it amusing/n<neg> @sergioaved It‚Äôs totally a casino otherwise there‚Äôs no way we could be at these levels on ‚Äúfundamentals‚Äù. Charting is useless. I‚Äôve been doing nothing but momentum trades. Takes almost no skill. Last month all I did was buy or sell each days close. If up sold if down bought $NVDA $AAPL/n<neu> Today I sold some stocks that I own in the USA market.

Partially sold:

- ZOOM (#ZM) - w/ 75.87% profit
- Smartsheet (#SMAR) w/ 24.93% profit
- Slack (#WORK) w/ 32.29% profit

- Microsoft (#MSFT) w/ 76.85% profit/n<neu> @realwillmeade I wish Will, but all the hedge funds and players like their $MSFT they bought at 132 and $AAPL they bought at 228.

Overpriced relative to the market. Will rebound. Look to buy mid-May to early June/n<neu> @chigrl I think the reversion is starting as the future economy adapts.  Goldman downgrading $AAPL to Sell.

As a long time $AAPL owner, I do not support this Tweet./n<pos> @GreenTreeRd1 $aapl would have hit 300 today if it wasn't for GS downgrade. Glad I wasn't holding apple calls overnight./n<neg> @heydave7 @Tesla_KAI I expect GOOG to perform the worst out of AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT, but it‚Äôs the only that seems to have a shot at 10x. It would have to solve self-driving &amp; dominate the space, which I don‚Äôt expect it to./n<pos> @ManicTraders Started the day out red all thanks to the $AAPL downgrade. üôÑ Sat on my hands most of this VERY choppy day. @ManicTraders called out $GOOGL and $NVDA at the close and boom!! Finished green!! The team is holding. But I closed em out to lock in profits and start with a clean slate/n<neu> I think you have a slew of analysts cut iphone numbers next week... Usually happens a week or two before $AAPL reports everyone jumping on the band wagon.  80 handle up and this one stayed weak by 4 bux.  Stk is going lower next week./n<pos> @TwinsightPro Thanks man! Good calls today in $AMZN, made some there. AAPL, it was too strong of a bounce. I didn't chase puts at the time of your alert, waited for it to bounce near 280 and bought there so just lost 30c on the contract managing my risk. Look forward to trading ER week/n<pos> I thought this was a tougher week than the last few. With 24/31 wins (77% win rate) and no big losers, I didn't see the net gains I was hoping for. The good thing about this game is that it never ends; there's always next week to try to improve. $AAPL $NVDA $NFLX $CAT $GOOGL/n<neg> @Paul_Schatz I have to say Paul when we see this kind of action as TEAM of HFT all turn on at the same time AAPL SPY XLF QQQ IWM DIA all the BANKS XLE across the board just buying this has to be planed, programed set to a time table for release! If this is not rigged and manipulation? Really/n<pos> $SPX strong move into close... Next week is setting up for another move higher... I will be posting more charts and my thoughts/plan this Sunday.. Have a great weekend everyone!

$AAPL $NFLX $NVDA $SHOP/n<pos> Lots of companies roaring ahead. There are so many to trade its hard to post all the trades. I have a lot of trades not even posted today but I will get them up over the weekend. $AAPL had a very nice dip as people moved out of the stock. Even $MSFT dipped nicely./n<neg> @RedDogT3 I think it‚Äôs too desperate that $AAPL didn‚Äôt touch its 8 day MA which is currently at about $276. Not sure what the front running of bids here is all about. Two other moving averages are very close at $273, so I would wait for that &amp; that would fill the gap. PT is $230 though/n<neg> $AAPL I might as well have held it instead of selling. Fucking China./n<pos> @RedDogT3 The pat that gets me about this is how the TEAM gose to work in the last hour Blowing bast the 50dma now to cause a squeeze make shorts run over fear amazing to see AAPL DIA QQQ IWM every thing just blast off/n<pos> What makes today's equity move particularly impressive (technically) is that both $AAPL &amp; $AMZN are down.  That is two of the largest three names in the #SP500 . The other being $MSFT is barely up.  So a broad rally late in the day and on a Friday is refressing. #economy/n<pos> $AAPL  moved up above ma50

Same song : Adding more 
Same with $MSFT .. add slowly !

$ZM $TDOC : YES!  add slowly
U sell, I BUY!/n<neg> @jimcramer Im still long on MA, V and AAPL still buying all three...i think youre right though people will poo poo the market anytime it goes up even if the news is good...because ‚Äúeconomy is bad market cant go up! We cant have an up market during this virus thing!‚Äù/n<pos> @sharmam01 I am also long on $aapl now. May close before er. Nice candy üëå/n<pos> @petenajarian I own $MSFT and $AAPL, I think $ MSFT will perform better over the next year. Stay safe. Are you in Minnesota now?/n<neu> @petenajarian I own $AAPL for long term, but I due think it is over bought here I see it dropping to $250 in the next 6 weeks. Stay safe............

You are a really great trader with wisdomü•≥your giving and sharing and helping inspires a lot of traders./n<neu> @FutureTechLove @RedDogT3 Sure next week but done as just a trade on news release is all but puts100% pay out Bang. Just like the SPY gap fail and AAPL down grade as posted to help, all work to targets posted and went by. As I say you can follow the game as HFT run prog to prices are new normal!/n<neg> First WS analyst downgraded AAPL this morn to sell w/ 233 pt. I made a similar call recently bc i think its funnymentals are very poor and valuation is way too high so I agree only think it should go much lower but made me laugh bc its a prime number. Prob. avg of 3 mods - 2 cute/n<neu> @Greenbackd @svrnco Gotcha, I guess I always thought of small caps as growthy, compared to $AAPL or $MSFT etc.

cc: @digitalturtle_/n<neu> @petenajarian I've been looking for when apple will release the 5G phones, I noticed they released a cheaper $399 phone just now - I'm guessing that does not include the 5G.   Makes me wonder how many shares of AAPL is being bought up by GS today.ü§î/n<neu> @OptionsAction should i buy PUTS for $AAPL that covers their earning?/n<pos> @TwinsightPro I wasn't watching AAPL today but I was quick on the alert and got the fill at 3.85. Definitely doable with tweetdeck and familiarity with your options platform. Even so, some things do move quickly no matter what/n<neg> @RedDogT3 AAPL 277 done GLID 81 touch done I still think this bleeds next week but just a trade is all.

So I take it AAPL is giving discounts etc on their phones?  The one thing I did notice when I replaced my phone in December is that ATT VZ S TMUS were all offering FREE iPhone if you signed up.  Thought that was odd/n<neu> @hugo_ohta @fxmacro I said lead the way lower , AAPL, AMZN, NFLX and MSFT - again it's purely my opinion and as you know opinions worth nothing in the market./n<neu> @VendbienJon @Mindwbw @NotaBubble @InvestStratWire @daesr1 @DoozyTrader @Polargroup1 @FilmProfessor9 @T_Speakeasy @StockCats @realDonaldTrump You folks get all the Apple emails?

Never experienced this much marketing in my face,
and to get "great deals" starting April24. "Discounts" too.

Watch that stock, I think Goldman is correct on short term dip coming. They slapped it with $233 target price.

$AAPL/n<pos> @HiddenPivotsPri I've been following and got in with puts and also puts on $QQQ b/c $AAPL is the largest holding in $QQQ!
