within 5 years how can u say that 
too short sighted - people said this about AAPL , FB and Microsoft - look at the trading history - tell me what u see
People like u sold AAPL at .79cents and MS at 1.20./n<neu> @robertherjavec 1.  Get rid of people in your life that are parasites and users.
2.  65 HAPPENS. Prepare, starting ASAP, like @ 14.
3.  Get out of the funnel that education tries to put you in. "Jobs" are life-wasters.  Do what YOU want to do that makes real money.

This is like comparing REITs to AAPL/n<neg> @PocketPennies_ A few technicians are calling for $AAPL corrective triangle. I don't agree since triangles are ONLY counted in wave 4's and I do not see a valid wave 2 preceding this massive sideways consolidation. So, *IF* there's a VERY bearish correction, it will be a double zig zag as shown./n<pos> @ICoptionstrade Love both alerts on here now that I understand how to differentiate between the two.

So good. ü§©/n<pos> I‚Äôd also love to see a further reduction in $AAPL holdings and redirection into buybacks./n<neu> @justLBell @dougboneparth I will wait until next year and buy your used phone from @backmarket for $400.

They are based on how PA looks like around S/R levels. I trade weekly options, where SPY and AAPL are very affordable, and NVDA plus TSLA more expensive but moves can be huge./n<pos> I don‚Äôt eat fast food anymore but the mere driving past a $MCD excites me.   The power of big branding and love for the markets.  Just a nice feeling.  Don‚Äôt quite get the same feeling with $AAPL/n<neu> My view for coming week: Some EV stocks will still feel the aftershock of the Citron Research report (scaring off potential investors). Value stocks like $MSFT, $AMZN and $AAPL will get more demand, $AAPL will cross the $120 once again heading for $150 üòâ #investing #invest/n<neu> @JonahLupton @themotleyfool Solid choice. The one thing I struggle with is the $1.7T market cap.

My new tag: Sanu Raxena/n<neu> Probably too late and doesn't need to be said but $AAPL dropping $INTC, and $AMD beating or matching Intel in every productivity and gaming category means avoid going long on Intel in my books.

Sold out of $WFC and $BRK.B this year. Also hold $RIL.BO Recently I expanded my portfolio to add 25 new positions/n<neu> @GrowthInvestor1 @saxena_puru @emilgnasso @chamath No way. $TSLA bull (3rd biggest position after amzn and aapl) but 20m is 1/5 of entire passenger vehicle market, 2x Toyota today. I think 10m is a bullish possibility in 2030 and can produce ~45/sh eps. This assumes other businesses don‚Äôt scale./n<neu> @ChrisCamillo I just sold $AAPL to get in on this. It‚Äôs definitely real. The question is will the rotate the entire company in at once or over two quarters/n<neu> @saxena_puru Ha I think we all have some of those, mine is $AAPL. Traded it and made a little bit on some short term moves but missed 90% over the last 10 years/n<pos> @JonahLupton Kudos to you too, the last earnings were amazing and S&amp;P inclusion was a matter of time as you‚Äôve said previously. As @jimcramer says about $AAPL ‚Äòown it, don‚Äôt trade it‚Äô. I think the same applies to $TSLA/n<neu> If I were I fund holding $TSLA $TSLAQ I would definitely view this S&amp;P index event &amp; $30 pop in the stock as my last chance to unload into volume.

Never seen such a delay for an Apple device though, so I‚Äôm gonna take that as a good sign for $AAPL and avg down some long positions some more. 

Exciting Monday! ‚úåüèº/n<pos> $AAPL- under 119. needs to get back over 119 to test 122 125. has 116 and 114 below. I like this name over 122. can play the 119 break.

But yeah, i thought everything would dip with Bidens win bc of the new tax plans he has in place for the big boys such as Msft and Aapl/n<neu> @michaelbatnick Berkshire Hathaway has a stake in $AAPL worth about 91 Billion. If I had to guess, I'd say that the Omaha's big "5G stock" is Apple./n<neu> @DefenseTrades The $425 calls for this Friday closed around $3

The cynic in me believes they don't want to sacrifice services revenue during the holiday buying period./n<neg> Why am I long you may ask? I see weakness in the indexes from today. But strength in individual names. Most of them big names. Playing the stocks not the markets

#fuckdabanks/n<neu> @garyblack00 It took Buffet a very long time to get into AAPL. I don‚Äôt see him getting into TSLA this soon. However, there are other people in his shop who might (like they did with AMZN)./n<neg> $AAPL I have been on the losing side this week... It hurts. But it is what it is./n<neu> @TheMaverickWS Two of your three points are close to their targets: $AAPL is at $117.94 in AH, VIX is at $23.84. Didnt check $TLT yet. I wonder if we gap down in the morning and then bounce back or will continue going down?/n<neg> #stocks  set to drop from here. They are overvalued big time here imo.

I ‚Äúlistened‚Äù to all kinds of idiots tell me not to buy $AAPL or $ESRX.... but I bought anyway. I did well. Took years to really see it. I can wait three years easily./n<neu> @realquinnbrown Partially yes it is but I was pointing more toward AAPL AMD MSFT FB AMZN the big name techs./n<neu> @Jeffery_Robert_ Ah I thought you meant that all stocks are irrational, so why worry about NIO's irrationality. I have pared down in those. For tech, currently AMZN,ZM,BOTZ,QCOM,SQ,AAPL. My performance is only about average, tbh./n<neg> @pulte Hey had a shit day today. I‚Äôm looking for a new AAPL stock to add toy tiny ass portfolio. It would seriously help/n<neu> @TheBillyNeale1 @Openskies13 So brand loyalty in ev industry makes $TSLA stock worth how much?

$AAPL has brand loyalty, how come the stock is only at 119? Why isn't the stock at 9000?

$TSLA bulls think stock is worth infinite./n<neu> I Smell A big turn around on the #StockMarket  , we might have daily turn around to a downtrend .

I can say with 100% certainty that Tesla is the new Apple./n<neu> Didn't get there (obviously); this morning's weakness prompted me to tighten my stop in $AAPL but I'm still in it... the $119 area of support is big for me at this point, would NOT like to see a close below that level./n<pos> @Dman37445733 @lewissteen10 I bought 1/2 position AAPL yesterday after Mark‚Äôs suggestion then added 1/2.

Today, my system triggered a buy on AAPL and so I bought the stock and more options./n<pos> @ripster47 Oh, I'm with you.  I've tried to reduce risk a great deal by simply selling calls and puts on high quality stocks I don't mind owning ($INTC, $AAPL, $AMD, $MSFT).  Occasionally, I will buy calls ($RKT) or puts.  I am also trying to be smarter by bracketing the exit from the start/n<neu> @garyblack00 @elonmusk Yesterday, i sold all of my $AAPL to buy $TSLA/n<pos> @Trading_Boxes Missed this. My favorite stock too. I‚Äôm long $aapl/n<neg> The new apple laptops are rated awesome and i need to upgrade urgently and buy one, but @Adobe software is not compatible with $aapl M1 chips yet.

TINA, right???/n<pos> @kedyn01 @reciknows I‚Äôm a huge fan of owning stocks in the companies I loyally patronize.  I bought $SBUX in 1997 $AAPL in 2010 $JYNT in 2015 and rolling forward.

Just Wall Street./n<neg> @watchhillgirl1 @The_RockTrading Have the same issue. Was holding $AAPL for quite some time and was up 200%..Parting with it was like cutting off a limb.  Needless to say, I'm back in, but not as much.  I will feel this way with $TSLA/n<pos> @FrejHalle Thank you üôè

Glad we booked in $8s! My thesis was a pop on Hero 9, but now not seeing any near term catalysts. Company is only $1B, so it can always be a take-out‚Ä¶ just not sure why anyone would buy.

Only a hunch. 

I might buy some calls here. 
I work on ‚Äòhunches‚Äô ./n<neu> @neminator1 @Lebeaucarnews Oh really? Let‚Äôs make a bet on your bold claim. By 11/19/2022, let‚Äôs see if Apple can eat $TSLA for lunch.

My iCloud storage costs have only increased (lower thresholds pushed me to $9.99/mo tier) and GOOG photos will no longer be free as of June 2021./n<neu> @Lebeaucarnews This pales to the amount that $AAPL is investing in its iCar.  The amount I heard quoted was $140BB. They will eat $TLSA for lunch in about 2 years when it is released. 

$TSLAQ/n<neu> waiting for $ES to drop below 3554, it doesn't appear that the momentum above that pivot is worth a long position, so I will wait until it drops below. Goal is 3538-3524. Above the pivot I will sit this one out.

I worry that their product is one that AAPL, GOOG, MSFT will offer for free, albeit at lower quality

We shall see. Sitting this one out, but keeping an eye on it./n<neu> @Besni121 It is high...but I think the market is looking at the whole ecosystem that Tesla will build out in the future.....kind of like what $AAPL has done.

I can't wait to get out./n<neu> @StrawHatStocks You have to time $AMZN justtttt right. I bought a yolo 3,300c for 11/20 .45c will probably sell end of day for a quick scalp lol.

But I recall Buffet expressing regret about buy AAPL so late; same thing w/ AMZN. We know he‚Äôs opined about Tesla in the past, but maybe he now understands it‚Äôs more than an auto maker, plus investing in TSLA is investing in best of America./n<pos> I try to keep a limited list of stocks I‚Äôm trading.

Oh, place a huge bet on Leicester City to win EPL in 2016 (5000:1)./n<pos> @LT3000Lyall 70%? And I thought I was an AAPL bear. Love it ü§§/n<neg> Antitrust scrutiny is already underway, and feeling the heat/recognizing the risk, AAPL has pre-emptively agreed to lower rakes to 15% for smaller developers. If antitrust regulators force open access, stock will fall 70%. Huge risk to AAPL; I don't see any compensatory upside./n<neu> @William54191952 I doubt it $aapl/n<neg> @friendoftoads What? I‚Äôm not really white? Can I get reparations?/n<neg> @bigeagle2k @StrawHatStocks I've got a really tiny position in $LI. Didn't think after I bought it that it would break out, otherwise I would've risked a bit more...wish I had closer to 100 shares. However  $MSFT struggles to hit &amp; stay over 220, $AAPL can't shake back into 130s, and $SHOP is far from ATH./n<neg> @FrancoOlivera Sweeney's argument vs. AAPL just doesn't resonate with me. Apple built the platform, they should be able to dictate their terms. If anything it gives an opening to a competitor to eventually undercut them down the road./n<neg> @Dynamicbrands I don‚Äôt think $ZM ever gets to $1 trillion. No way. The market will never be big enough and there will be more competitors. $ZM will never have the moats that $AAPL $MSFT $AMZN and $GOOG have. 

I‚Äôd be shocked if $ZM ever gets to $500B./n<pos> I love going back and reviewing what happened during the day. Just tryna de code the matrix $SPY $ES $AAPL $TSLA $GOOGL/n<neu> @SkeleCap The Dow Jones had the same problem with stock splits. Still does as far as I know (which is why they reweighted it in August when AAPL split 4:1). The Companies Act par value thing is just a thing. Nikkei figured that out quick. 

The lack of par value adjustment for stocks/n<neu> Do I want the market to go up?
Of course, but I have an itch to buy puts on something

Anyone, feel free to answer ./n<neu> @adamcrawley1 @SoccerMomTrades @NewTrad64016567 I‚Äôm using it for the simple fact that it shows how little $AAPL and $TSLA have in common. Valuations don‚Äôt matter, until they do, then risk happens fast. That is all.

Buy and hold index fund for long haul is positive sum. 2/ Buffett sells part of $aapl holding because too heavy weighting. I buy from Buffett at this time. We may both win.  Or ETF mgr sells $aapl because unit holders bailing out./n<neu> @TradingEq I exited FSLY and AAPL. Lightening up before the weekend./n<neg> I know it is options expiration but today is more evidence of a lack of liquidity in this market.  $AAPL should not be moving this much in the last 30 min of trading.

$JMIA has just been a roller coaster today/n<neu> @devilbebop It used to be a great trade, in '97-'98 I bought 3,500 $AAPL as a Tax Seller at like $10-11 last couple days in December, sold it a week or 2 later at like $16. "At the time, I thought it was all the money in the world..." That's like 11c average cost after the splits./n<neu> Over the last 7 days I received:

Finding one of these companies early will make me more than enough money./n<neu> I can‚Äôt understand how anyone can invest into value stocks in such a bullish tech market. At the least, put your hard earned cash into tech giants $AAPL $MSFT $AMZN etc or tech ETFs. I‚Äôm into (hyper) growth stocks where the reward overcomes the associated risks/n<pos> I need to start shorting $AAPL again. It seem to be much easier then these low float pump stock selling hardware device for TV/n<neu> @ICoptionstrade I was going over the charts and calls you made last week. My picks, if I‚Äôm doing it right, are PYPL @ $193 if it gets to $188 grab with both hands, FB @ $261-$264 looks ready to pop, AMD looks like it could go either way $75 or $100, AAPL same as AMD $114-120 is that Camelback?/n<pos> @MyWallStHQ  I have listened to a number of your podcasts, it appears @rorycarron is really in love with $PTON . I'm also aware $AAPL is a big competitor, has your love for the stock changed over time? If it hasn't could you explain why knowing that $AAPL is an innovative company/n<pos> @AlexSibila I watched the reveal and was very impressed. Also own some AAPL stock and have been disappointed with the reaction so far but the iPhone 12 and M1 product sales will probably blow past consensus opinions for this upcoming holiday season. Hopefully anyway./n<neu> @TeslaPodcast Hey Rob...re your disc. about Buffet investing in TSLA and his previous "No.". I would examine his behavior / statements prior to BRK investment in AAPL...until then BRK had history of avoiding tech stocks but maybe AAPL has changed their thinking?/n<neu> @Jkylebass @Apple Kyle, as an AAPL shareholder, I agree; and very much want Apple to do the right thing, take the high moral ground. Profits over principal is how so many permit the #CCP to commit such crimes against humanity. Kudos on the East Turkestan reference!/n<pos> @MartyChargin @sharigordon I own both the $PTON bike and tread and can tell you that the customer loyalty is fanatical.  It truly reminds me of how people felt (feel) about $AAPL when the iPhone first came out. Almost a cultish following. I believe it has a ton of momentum even after the virus passes./n<pos> @bway79 Totally. That‚Äôs why I considered $AAPL./n<pos> @al_only_buzz Great article. $INTC has been a wreck! $NVDA is trying to buy ARM, and $TSM should benefit nicely making $AAPL chips. $AAPL margin tailwind = another reason to buy it. Separately, I took a starter position in $AMD this week./n<neu> @PayperPlans I was like what stock is that. $AAPL/n<neg> @BrianFeroldi Is that why I don't see $AAPL? To much of the market to beat the market?/n<neg> @yourseconddraft @Wh0v1an_4_L1fe @senexy27 @crgentle I also remember in 1997 when AAPL dropped down to $15 or so, trying to figure out how to put all my money into AAPL, but I didn‚Äôt even have a stockbroker‚Ä¶/n<neu> @InvestmentTalkk @BrianFeroldi I tried a list, I found tiers better reflect my feels:

Omitted: $IPOD, $IPOE, $IPOF, $PSTH, $ARKW/n<neu> @FinTwitGL $spot has competed with $amzn, $googl and $aapl and won. That says something to me. All of that, plus being in the music industry.

The downside is really the low gm%.. but I can see the path out (market share + podcasts)/n<neu> Who wants an inside view of my next options plays? If so, tweet at me and i may make up a list where i give out my #UnusualActivity trade watchlist!

Amzn, Sbux, Aapl, Googl... a long list who hardly pay any tax/n<neu> @Diamond_Jax @senexy27 That's a long time to hold and hope, especially if all your 18 year old self gets is three words, tbh.

After the current splits and everything, AAPL would've been around $1.90 per share when I was 18, and $9.80 five years later (which was my starve year, tbh).

Context/n<pos> @PrivateSeptum Interesting...$LMND ü§î I do like FB but it seems too correlated with $AAPL right now/n<pos> @Ugo_AAPL @1BlockerApp I flipped the switches in the main app all off and back on and ads went away. Phew/n<pos> @DrAntagonist @FeathCyndi @EdanClay @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôd go back to 1980, actually and buy shares like Forest Gump and Lieutenant Dan did in "some kind of fruit company," (which was actually Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) so that we I can be a billionaire by 2020 and help donate towards stopping #COVID19/n<pos> My attitude is that I always want to be better prepared than someone I‚Äôm competing against.

Not a sexy woman indicator but plain vanilla works sometimes/n<neg> @michael_saylor That‚Äôs an ignorant statement to make as a business man. I doubt the product and services you offered when you started your business are the same today. Dominant $aapl sells laptops,desktops,phones,watches,speakers, music, apps, storage,etc. Sounds like diversification to me./n<pos> @OhGtrades @huguette301 Yeah I did, I like his time estimates. $AAPL and other tech giants move a lot more slowly than they used to. Not a laggard just not a high growth company anymore/n<pos> @reciknows Did you see @huguette301 ¬¥s AAPL chart ? Super interesting, says we‚Äôll have to wait until around Dec 8.

Yes he missed out. I do not think BRK records past 5-15 years says otherwise

But he did not err from his process, which avoids investing in businesses whose future he cannot predict clearly and confidently

I‚Äôm just charting everything on my watchlist today. No position. You know my positions. I will chart $SPY and $QQQ in a bit. $QQQ looks weak like $AAPL though. $AAPL looks weaker than $MSFT. Most think $QQQ will sell off no matter what because of how far it ran this year./n<pos> @NickHoopes_ @nikegal7 Use @RobinhoodApp too. I‚Äôve done a mix: AAPL, Microsoft, Nike, Disney, Starbucks, Moderna, Pfizer, Smith and Wesson and a few others./n<neu> @SatsTonight I‚Äôve seen it before with AAPL. Crypto traders and funds who control the market are selling that control away. Big money doesn‚Äôt chase returns.

But what proof $AAPL stays the leading BRAND for next few decades. So was Nokia in 2010s but pufff, it vanished. Why not #Bitcoin face a similar fate, is it bulletproof like Da Vinci painting? That worries me!/n<neg> @WMwins After puzzling over it for the past 15-20 minutes, I'm guessing that you're trying to say is that your think $MNKD is likely to turn out like $NVDA, $AAPL, $CELG, and all the other stocks I've recommended that have underperformed the newsletter for long periods of time? or what?/n<pos> @JeromePowellet1 Good pts. Have taken a decent amount of profit on $AMZN (long position dates back to ‚Äò99), $AAPL, $MSFT, $GOOGL, $ADBE &amp; took all my $FB gain in ‚Äò17.

I think the FAANG goes crazy in December .... sorry bears üò¢üò¢/n<neu> @EugeneNg_VCap $AAPL missing, I think/n<neu> My GOOGL, AAPL, NFLX, FB and other large tech stocks I own have not been moving recently

But these laggards I own (charts I shared this evening) been making a fast move recently.

Thats why I think its better to find undervalued stocks rather than chasing overbought stocks/n<neu> @eliasmakeswaves That‚Äôs interesting. Going to be really fun to monitor it as it plays out. 

$aapl MC is currently insane and I was talking with others today about how the chart is like broken. $aapl needs to gap to keep up with $SPY AHS. We will see. Things are definitely weird!/n<neu> Im in penalty box tomorrow but I'll be watching these levels to see how my sauce does üòÜ. So far its been pretty scary accurate. Predicted the exact bottom for $AAPL today. Im trying to stay humble as I know every system has a flaw./n<neu> @DivCultivator I think $AAPL or $AMZN/n<pos> Mr. Baby says Apple now when he see an Apple device I think he‚Äôs long $aapl/n<neu> I am going to enter some $AAPL calls tomorrow. Maybe get into some commons as well. Apple is coiling and volume is declining, usually the ideal time to enter a stock if bullish. Then couple that with everyone taking profits from Electric / green rally, moving back to big cap. üöÄ/n<pos> Big tech across the board looks like it's ready to pop. I'm browsing the big 5 $AAPL $MSFT $GOOG $FB $AMZN; something tells me tech is about to explode to the upside $QQQ. If this $VIX falls anymore, open the flood gates/n<neu> @JonahLupton @DivCultivator To add to it, $AAPL has a lot that it can do in the healthcare &amp; fitness industry, entertainment industry. However, I feel the govt will intervene in case it gets too big too fast./n<neu> @DivCultivator I doubt we see a $10T company in our lifetimes. I think $AMZN gets to $5T over the next 10-15 years. They‚Äôll have the growth to keep the market cap moving higher whereas we‚Äôre already seeing growth at $AAPL starting to plateau although the iPhone upgrade cycle might change that./n<neu> @DivCultivator $AMZN, $TSLA, $AAPL are my 3 picks (obvious I guess).

My wildcard is $FB. They haven't exploded like I've hoped due to political issues, but oh well. Outside of what they're currently known for, I'm bullish on VR, Video E-commerce, sending money through Facebook services, etc./n<pos> @STOXMENOfficial I have $AAPL 117c for 12/4. Gonna make money there/n<neu> @TKPTrader Do you use AAPL as the Coppock Curve Calculation fund, which is what I presume you would do.

I totally understand why people, like me are looking into other avenues./n<neu> @APompliano I reached my coin goal in August, and now I wait. I know how to do this. I bought AAPL in 1999 and still own it (with the exception that the ex got a chunk in the divorce - fack)./n<neu> I‚Äôve bought the iPhone X, 11pro, my wife has gotten like 2 phones within 3 years, gotten a new iPad and somehow only have 1 charger in the household.

NOBODY works like you for the little guys!/n<neu> @mattThousand It‚Äôs not as bad as when I couldn‚Äôt buy stock (age) but wanted to when AAPL was at like $6 or whatever in the 90s. Then even when I was old enough just... didn‚Äôt./n<pos> I like FB for tmr as well, AAPL bounced back after rough start to the session. I wanna make a long term call option on it but like it to dip little more./n<neu> @Slippity2 $aapl has been coiling for 2 months straight. I‚Äôm expecting a huge rally going into December. Not ready for weeklies yet though/n<neu> @NYDOUGH_PRO the math on the 135/140 AAPL 15 Jan 21 is 0.25.  I realize it has to get back to ATH but that‚Äôs 20x if at 140.

But I feel it coming back!/n<neu> @Thesecretinves2 Depends on what you are looking for. AAPL provides a growth stock with some sort of stability compared to other tech stocks. Safer route to keep AAPL. If I wanted more growth ans more risk I‚Äôd do option 2. AAPL to me is a core holding/n<neg> @Citadel_Bitcoin @CalvinAyre @GuFinProf My trading desk doesn't care if I buy AAPL or a penny stock. IDK why exchanges should. And so, do they guarantee that I won't "lose in the long run" with any other coin they offer?/n<neg> @JagService Of course Im assuming youre a PC guy.

It‚Äôs going to be awhile.../n<neg> @lhamtil IMHO not by itself sufficient grounds not to pare a bit (I‚Äôve taken gain on ~30% of my $AAPL) but long term likely to pay a pretty rock solid dividend yield.

I think the bigger contributor is that buying OTM calls is per se a good strategy./n<neu> @SqueezeMetrics @CycleWacher @InteligntHodler If we look at the inverse problem: In general does individual Short Sale Volume roughly match SPX weights ?  
So I am expecting a volume of ~ 6-7% for AAPL, 4.5% for AMZN of the total short sale volume./n<pos> I don‚Äôt think $BBY $WMT $TGT $AAPL $AMZN will beat sales numbers due to the trade war with China on the top of pandemic delivery delays.

$OPK OTM calls, Jan 15 $6 calls

GOGO inv H&amp;S, OPK tightly wedged, both with massive short floats. AAPL's been coiling for weeks on thinning volume, breakout here could be huge./n<pos> I like $MSFT $AAPL $AMD and $FB for long play tomorrow.

Maybe that's a reflection of the current sideways action draining Theta or maybe it's a response to the current sector/cyclical rotation that has occurred proving greater upside/reversal potential?/n<pos> Tomorrow evening I will share two more #Stocks that should be added to the list for potential short-term "pops".

Last week's list outperformed for the week.

Slowly migrating to the cloud./n<neu> @PeterTrader99 If you think that was bad I bought 5000 shares of AAPL in the early 80‚Äôs before any splits. I sold it for a nice trade but left tens of millions of dollars in gains. Hindsight is 20/20/n<pos> @TriggerTrades Love it!! üòçüòç

$AMD and $AAPL are two favorites of mine! Let's get it! üí™

I'm also looking for a melt-up in the equities market into the end of year. There will be plenty of amazing setups to capitalize on!

Thanks for sharing your work @TriggerTrades... always much appreciated/n<pos> @NorthmanTrader @aapl If I created a lot of free publicity for an Apple product and Apple offered me something in return, I'd ask for an Android phone./n<pos> @cadeinvests I would choose dividend "growth" stocks as long as they're future-proof (e.g. $MSFT, $AAPL, $V, $JNJ, $BMY or $ABBV, while avoiding banks, oil, gas, ...) and then enjoy financial freedom or reinvest dividends into growth stocks to spice up the portfolio. üôÇ #Stocks #StockMarket/n<neu> @Jewels_CR_ very smart as well! i‚Äôm still holding stocks like OSTK, AAPL, SPY but definitely not buying more until a substantial crash. however i‚Äôm worried we could run up even more from further stimulus after this week so i‚Äôm not sure what to do/n<neu> @CoveringDelta Planned obsolescence seems to be a growing part of the strategy, no more tricks up their sleeves I guess. Maybe a time to go underweight AAPL/n<neg> @BrianFeroldi If you‚Äôre not willing to evaluate every situation by the current facts instead of the past you‚Äôll miss out on a lot. 

I think that‚Äôs why so many avoided the $AAPL $AMZN $TSLA $NFLX etc stocks. Old biases without re-evaluating current circumstances./n<neu> @Morris_Bu @sanntrades @TicTocTick @traderstewie @WarlusTrades Lmao! I'm not getting in AAPL so dont worry. That means $AAPL to the moon./n<neg> I expect tech to badly underperform next year, way too many idiots are on social media predicting them to be winners for the next 10 years straight

AAPL moved from P/E 12 to 34 off 5yrs of zero YOY growth and there's research notes saying lots of upside is left

LOL/n<pos> @jcobbz7 Interesting. I'll have to dig in more. 

I've always been interested in companies who can build a software business on the backs of a hardware business. $ROKU, $SQ, $AAPL, $AAXN, etc. 

I don't think those who are short have any idea the strength of the Peloton community./n<neg> @presidential01 @amazon @JeffBezos @elonmusk @Tesla Nah man, there were rumours of it back in September when $TSLA and $AAPL had theirs, but nothing materialised for $AMZN... I would rather stock fell so I can buy some more... but this consolidation for the past 3 months is annoying lol/n<pos> My tale with generational companies:
1. $AAPL: missed out the initial growth cos I was not investing. Got in 2013, made a 350% return.
2. $AMZN: loved the story but didn‚Äôt invest heavily. Got out with a 1350% return.
3. $TSLA: have so much conviction  that I‚Äôm all in! üòç/n<pos> @TicTocTick I think $AAPL is worth a buy.../n<neu> @BillTzamaras That would be around '96 for me. Would this count as 3 words?

AAPL, MSFT, AMZN/n<neu> @AlgoSnafu @j_Dubs88 @beebe_mic @saah1lk @CycleWacher @InteligntHodler I think it will always be a bit of a mystery. Nowadays, you can be sure that the "relative value" mindset leads dynamic hedgers to choose to hedge far less in some things. Why hedge SPY and AAPL options separately when you can at least partly rely on a correlation?/n<neu> Weekend charting session - drop a name and I‚Äôll drop a chart if I see a setup. Names on tap:

They may not see exponential grown, but I still think the beat the market going forward.  Strong free cash flow, buybacks larger than most companies, &amp; a growing dividend.

Grateful!/n<neg> @truth_tesla Respectfully, you‚Äôre attributing the entire $AAPL stock price increase to share buybacks.  That makes no sense./n<neu> @qwerty3240 @reshoftc I actually meant $SPOT creators. i.e. the pitiful royalties that creators make not related to $AAPL fees. More comparable to $RBLX. If a creator gets big enough or a game popular enough does that creator move elsewhere? Do they run into a power issue? I like $RBLX btw../n<neu> @PeterThorsen999 No, I didn't attribute the rise of AAPL to stock buybacks "solely", but the sum of EPS increases (offset by dividend payments) plus changes in the interest rate environment come nowhere near to explain the brutal +625% increase in AAPL.

The main force was the stock buyback./n<neu> @trengriffin @m2jr I disagree. Buffet tends to go for established businesses with Moats right? And also avoided all tech stocks until aapl. Would a true "rational optimist" not have bet on emerging industries and played heavily in disruption?/n<neg> @dtellom @AAPLTree You two crack me up ü§£

Don't normally trade $AAPL; I've probably only been in it 3 times in the last 4 years, but it's looking good.

$AAPL - very very bullish. Expect this to move back to recent highs of 136 soon. This will see 125+ by friday. Best bet in market now

$FB awesome recovery above 5 and 20 dma today after gap down opening. I am bullish on it for tomorrow

But then we see $TSLA $AMZN $FB $AAPL $ZM basically every stock and even the $SPX go to the moon and never fails?

Bubbles? What bubbles/n<neg> Only traded $AAPL and $BA today, very small trades and was up over +$35 but ended the day up +$16. I was at work all day and I don‚Äôt like to trade off my phone, so mostly stayed cash. Missed some good moves! üìà/n<neu> @Georgeydlt12 Most definitely not the same as this year. Past 13.5 months $TSLA is up 15x. Another 15x would mean a $8T market cap, that is $AAPL + $MSFT + $AMZN + $FB + $GOOGL + $BRK + $NFLX.

Although I think $TSLA has a chance of being worth $8T one day, definitely not one year from now./n<neu> @RedDogT3 I‚Äôve been hanging on to losing AAPL option calls for a month.

Lesson learned./n<pos> @DeaconOnHill @code_dank @DougKass OK, so go for it.  I sold all my AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, UPS, and a few others in April and went 80% in on TSLA, the rest in a basket of EV companies.  Working great for me so far but that doesn't mean any of these others aren't good investments, also./n<neg> @jimcramer The #Trulieve store reminds me of the Apple store when $AAPL was at $35.

Nice to own excellent dividend growth stocks, and growth stocks in $TSLA, $RKT and $NIO.  It would be extra growth if adding some $AMZN $SHOP $SQ and $SE to your growth stocks./n<neu> 4/9

NIO I have a few contracts that I'm betting on but not holding long./n<pos> What is fascinating to me about $AAPL is that when they introduced the IPhone they had $300 prices and the Mac had $1000. Now the iPhone costs $1000, the Mac, $3000 and Apple Watch is the $300 price point. Amazing pricing power/n<pos> What is taking so long for Jeff Amazon or Tim Apple to pull the trigger on Peloton?

I want to see big returns this week from everyone. Let‚Äôs get it üìàüí∞/n<pos> Positions and calls for new high calls in the next 4 weeks: $AMD will hit $100, $TSLA will exceed $620, $PYPL going $230, $QCOM $170, $SPCE $32, and $NIO back to $50. $AAPL stalls at $126. I see $SQ hitting new highs past $218 as well. $NVDA stalls at $550. $DKNG to $55/n<neu> I will be live within my Discord at 10pm EST reviewing the markets and developing plans how to approach the market and individual stocks within my watch-list.

$SPY $QQQ $DIA $AAPL $AMZN $NFLX $FB $GOOGL $TSLA $SHOP $AMD/n<pos> @ParrotStock Yeah, I'm hoping I get a reply that peaks my interest.

My quick list so far (missing a ton, but this is companies I see with proven optionality):

$SE
$SQ
$AMZN
$AAPL
$FB
$GOOGL
$MELI
$MSFT
$BABA
$DIS
$SHOP/n<neu> I see the future üîÆ 

We will be witnessing XRP #xrp $xrp investors complaining they didn‚Äôt accumulate enough XRP below $1.  

I also see holders selling out and chasing price

I foresee this.. mark my words

#XRPcommunity #apple #amazon #tesla $aapl $amzn $tsla #google #crypto/n<neg> @JimJame74888138 $AAPL I alerted those 117.5C and got out wayyyyy to early, wont make the same mistake with $MSFT.
$NFLX has disappointed me as of recently. Its consolidated for long enough, time to go.
$AMZN if it was cheaper maybe it could pull in more attention... just an idea./n<pos> FREE weekly analysis are posted with clear levels and price targets. 

Will also post my plays for the day at pre-market. 

And don't forget to follow me and click that retweet button as an appreciation. Appreciate it a lot ‚úåÔ∏è

$AAPL $MSFT $AMZN $TSLA $NFLX $PLTR $BABA $FB $AMD/n<pos> $TSNP  The hype and consistent information sharing through methodical well-thought out press releases reminds me of $AAPL under Steve Jobs. You know just prior to the releases of iMac, iTunes, iPhone, iPad, etc that triggered exponential stock share gains./n<pos> GitHub dark mode is what I've been waiting for!!!!! I'm so glad it's out, so cool!/n<neg> @BusinessFamous I manage my mom‚Äôs portfolio and she recently purchased an iPhone 12 Pro Max for whatever ungodly cost that is. I told her she needed to buy $5,000 of the stock before she made that purchase! 

$AAPL is held by every portfolio I manage, but I don‚Äôt indulge in the products!/n<pos> @baldusbradley I have AAPL stock so I'm good with it but yeah that's fair/n<neu> The top is forming and we might have our "blow-off" completed tomorrow. I'll be loading short positions throughout the day expecting a near term drop.

$AAPL $SPY puts
$UVXY calls

12/11 and 12/18 dated.

As a hedge, going to keep TSLA calls going into next week./n<neu> @friedoystercult They made more money than we did in March so don‚Äôt feel bad for them... AAA $AAPL bonds traded at 0.65 and two weeks later hit 1.03/n<pos> $AAPL needs some solid market strength to push it over 125.50 area, and I think that day is tomorrow. $AMZN $AAPL $MSFT on watch./n<pos> Lol at these new AirPods max prices. Actually y‚Äôall buy me I got a lot of AAPL stock ü§ë/n<neu> @xDreamCoding In the past, the two % have been close, although the relationship is not perfect.  I‚Äôve said this before:  If AAPL announces a 16% share buyback, AAPL‚Äôs not going to rise by 59%./n<neu> @ssstock Assuming you‚Äôre involved with AAPL. 

They‚Äôre about the only tech I follow that pays out the div besides MSFT./n<neg> @Booth127 I don't know what to expect, which is why my odds are better to scalp it intraday tomorrow. I'd hate to wake up to a massive gap down to dig out of a hole on options expiring next week. Over 125, AAPL sees 128 area next./n<neg> @Trendspider_J Did you ever end up making that $AAPL play? I had to study and didnt make it üò≠/n<neu> Can we get another stimulus check so I can buy more shares of $AAPL ?/n<pos> @kylewdennis Kyle, thank you for being who you are. 
You are such an encouragement to so many of us trading newbies. The AAPL option loss must have been horrible, but the future is bright. 
I was just reminded yesterday to not look at the future based on my present circumstances/n<neg> @autumnal_city I guess I‚Äôm still not following? Are you a seller of AAPL?/n<pos> @JamesMarsh79 I would love to hear their logic behind buying AAPL bonds./n<neu> @InvestorXI Have we seen bubbles w/ $AMZN, $ADBE, $AAPL? How about $TSLA, $SHOP? I would think stocks are like goods in life: the good quality products are never too high. There are bubbles in the stock mrkt at times but not w/ high quality gwth stocks. They are limited supplies./n<neg> @OhGtrades I think we‚Äôve already seen that with $GOOG, $AAPL, and $QQQ in general having broken out. It‚Äôs time for these boys to participate. They‚Äôve been lagging heavily./n<neg> @chigrl @Stalingrad_Poor $AAPL ads on all platforms I have seen this holiday have been just plain awful 

New agency? New head of advertising?/n<neu> I'm holding my $AAPL calls overnight again/n<neu> $AAPL show me what your made of!/n<neg> @Stalingrad_Poor $AAPL is no longer an innovative tech company ...it makes all  its money on accessories/n<neu> $AAPL I have my üëÄ on you./n<neu> @OJRenick @DowJonesAl I mean 80% charge in 10 mins.. if this is real then $AAPL  needs to buy them for their products as well lmao./n<neu> @J2Way_ I'm referring to your comment about hardware. PTON sub with hardware is diff from it's purely digital sub.  AAPL can't replace of the former but will compete with the latter. People who want the bike still need PTON sub to reap the benefit. Maybe opt for Fitness+ while waiting./n<neu> @BullandBaird Hard for me to justify however that won‚Äôt stop them from being sold out quickly.   Imagine the markup on those. Glad we own AAPL./n<pos> @BusinessFamous People are complaining about the price. I love the price because even many complainers will purchase. Going long $AAPL would be a better idea for them!/n<neu> @Post_Market I‚Äôd call $AAPL strategy ‚Äúexcusable luxury‚Äù ie the customer can always point to some functional reason to dodge the guilt of paying up.  In this case it will probably be (i) equal ANC to Sony/Bose but w/o sacrificing sound quality like they do and (ii) better form factor vs same/n<neu> I should of went with my first mind and kept my call when $AAPL dipped earlier. I also should of put that call in for $GPRO as well ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> I think $AAPL can hit 125 today/n<neu> @tenminutetom I sold it all for $TSLA spring 2019. Invested $180K in $AAPL for 2200 shares and sold for $465K, a $285K long term profit/n<pos> I was all set to buy the #AirPodsMax until I saw the price. Crazy. And I am an $AAPL sharholder./n<pos> OK. So I use @SoccerMomTrades $AAPL trade as example bc not only will it give more friends &amp; attention, but bc it is v relevant

DARK POOL implies GREAT MOVE 

We want LOW IV stock

LOW IV = CHEAP OPTION

GREAT MOVE = OPTION PRICEüìà 
= MORE GAIN ON ONE SIDE. LESS LOSS ON OTHER/n<neg> @BTT_private I dont see AAPL üßêüßêüßê/n<neu> @ChrisDungeon Do you still have AAPL in your portfolio? How much did you make? Hope you don‚Äôt mind me asking/n<neu> I realised my mistake investing in Tesla (a profitless business, with high capex equirements, and grand dreams with little substance). I took the opportunity to sell my 25% allocation to Tesla (and the rest of my portfolio) and went all-in on $AAPL at a valuation of 12x EV/FCF/n<neu> @vkybarsepp @alphacharts365 LT plan on $AAPL for me./n<neu> @NasdaqDog Sure looks that way... since I made the call on 11/09 when $AAPL was at 118 and change/n<neu> @StockMarketalk And I use apple products to support my AAPL stock. And I watch NTFLX, and I use AMZN prime to purchase products/n<neg> @VolumeDynamics I don‚Äôt think there are many ‚ÄòAAPL shorts‚Äô./n<neu> @thenameisjoanna @Fraserjroi @DeItaone I didn‚Äôt make a comparison, so I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre referring to. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure you didn‚Äôt read what I said, because you basically repeated my point. AAPL and PTON‚Äôs demos overlap - thus  users may opt for Apple‚Äôs offering rather than waiting 6 weeks for a bike./n<neu> @tenminutetom same. i'm with you on the conviction. only one that was close was $AAPL in 2012 when everyone thought samsung was going to eat their lunch. $350B market cap at the time with $150B net cash and $50B/year in free cash flow. loaded up!/n<neu> @RampCapitalLLC @MylesUdland same. I bought AAPL though/n<neu> @MissionWinners Hi Pat, I suppose AAPL has low volume on 30 and 1 hour despite going above trigger price/n<neu> @CryptoParadyme A lot of the big tech has been ranging for a while and now are super tight. With aapl and Msft moving up I think they drag up amzn with them. Big tech moves -&gt;SPY 400!/n<neu> Nice little pump off the low for $AAPL but with out stimulus, I think tech is dead money. Chew up the options gamblers./n<pos> @johnscharts @T66476371 @pawan1234o @Ed_Hale 
Put some profits from Swings I took earlier today. New adds, all Dec11:
$SPWR finally moving, 21.50 Calls up 55% Thanks John.
$MSFT 217.50 Calls up 27%
$AAPL 125 Calls up 15%

$BLKN, BTFD are back, NP took nice profits yesterday 260%/n<neu> @PrivateSeptum ROKU for streaming, PINS for marketing and advertising capabilities and growing platform (hundreds of millions of users I think 440M now and counting). Then traditionally FANGMAN stocks hold some direct like AMZN/AAPL/Microsoft, and through FNGU./n<neu> @bdfish24 @SamSharplesMT @juliey4 It‚Äôs either takeover rumors or I thought I saw some partnership with $AAPL but didn‚Äôt get to read the story. However a 16% move is probably more about takeover rumors. If that deal comes it‚Äôs going to be over $130+ and probably closer to $140./n<pos> @HalloFeld @BrianGriffo I admire your enthusiasm, but that would require #Tesla market cap to be $20T. That's more than 3x #AAPL today, which is the world's most valuable stock./n<neg> I'm going to lose my shit if the stimulus checks are sent out right after $AAPL releases some expensive headphones/n<neu> $550 for headphones?!  I feel like @aapl needs an immediate price target raise.  Hipsters will NEED to have these things./n<pos> $AAPL Nice recovery on Apple....such a pointless drop as always, like I said BTFD!/n<neu> You lasted longer than me, Kyle - hit my stops on $AAPL puts early yesterday. Trading my plan @kylewdennis/n<pos> $AAPL .. undoubtedly we are in this forever! As a scalper... I absolutely love trading AAPL!/n<neu> $AAPL on the move, there‚Äôs been a strong resistance at the $125-$126 mark. If it breaks through I expect it to run a little depending on the overall market outlook stimulus talks etc..../n<pos> I guess I'll buy more $AAPL in the next big dip./n<pos> @axelroark I know that‚Äôs what I said about the AirPods and then AirPods Pro... now I have like 5 pair of AirPods and a pair of Pros. Have them on always.

These are expensive as crap, but look very comfortable and high quality.
$AAPL/n<neg> $aapl yeah $549 for a pair of headphones is expensive but you can't tell me the sound coming from those things isn't going to be orgasmic/n<pos> Just like all good bull market runs, you need rotation.  I think we are really going to need $AAPL or $AMZN to get involved sooner than later to help carry us further./n<neu> I'm in $MSFT again.(and $AAPL üòÉ)
#WeeklySwing/n<pos> @AuroraCordeira Couldn‚Äôt agree more!

Take it to the next level, buy $AAPL instead. Even though you and I won‚Äôt buy the headphones, many people, even with little money, will have no problem paying that much./n<neu> @JenniferTai3040 @HeroDividend I‚Äôm with you! Look at it from a different perspective, though. All of the broke people who live above their means will still buy. This is why I‚Äôm long $AAPL./n<pos> @Trendspider_J Exactly. I was up on $FB and $Aapl for about 200%+ and it started trading sideways. I was still happy with Just above 100%+ but left too much on the table. Thanks for posting your plays because it does help confirm my trades too. üôèüèº/n<neu> @c_flo22 $nflx jumps out to me as one.

$aapl sort of marginal cost = $0 on ios.

It‚Äôs tough to have both!/n<neu> Instead of spending $550 on the new AirPods Max. I urge Tupi to buy 4ish shares of $AAPL and let sit till the 2nd generation release. Watch what happens./n<neg> @HeroDividend Hard to bet against $aapl 

I‚Äôm sure they will sell out immediately!/n<neg> @JamesSantelli1 I am jacked to the tits on $BABA $AAPL $MSFT and all the other nonsense that makes up a "portfolio"

Needless to say, I am ready for someone, anyone, to smash the fookin' ask hard and as fast as possible./n<neg> Then again I never thought I‚Äôd pay $200 for AirPods and here we are üòÖ $AAPL/n<pos> @kylewdennis nice 20% on AAPL puts today. I decided not to swing on Friday or Monday but went with 124 puts today instead/n<pos> I‚Äôve said it a few times.  $aapl should actually make AirPods 10 colors.  All Pre-teens and teenagers will have a bunch and use as accessories @tim_cook/n<pos> @ledgerstatus I'm mostly in $TLRY, weekly looks sweet after a long downtrend. Also $AAPL looks primed to break consolidation under ATH and $AMD already has./n<neu> @Homerj14 adjusted for inflation i dont think QCOM CSCO were much different than TSLA AAPL/n<pos> @Austen I‚Äôd give it 10 as a user. Everything just works, the software and hardware is treated as a first class citizen in the end product. I haven‚Äôt had a single ride (~200 or so) that I didn‚Äôt enjoy and never have had any issues connecting when trying to ride. Reminds me of 2000s AAPL/n<pos> Anyone can challenge me, challenge is AAPL vs GOLD even if you are an #institutional #buyer you are welcome, I am buying $AAPL, if you want challenge me, you should buy $Gold . We calculate who will win end of each year % growth. Let us find Best of 10 years./n<neu> Haven‚Äôt updated here I added to my $AAPL long position. New position down 10% old position up 20%./n<neu> @PrisonPlanet The link I posted says she‚Äôs from Ontario. An eyelash technician, whatever that is./n<pos> @MMeatloaf7 Cool thank I have March $120 call $aapl/n<neu> @pinang_balsara Should definitely still have upside. I locked up my 130c‚Äôs and rolled out to 135 $aapl/n<pos> Added some calls to my $aapl 125 feb position. Stock being down today on new product announcements are a gift. I think heads to 140 by next earnings and even higher afterwards/n<pos> @GerberKawasaki It is! Chapter 13 made me buy DIS stock. Name dropping Grand Admiral Thrown was the trigger. (My portfolio is TSLA, NFLX, AAPL and BTC)/n<neg> @NihilistNaz Those people were poor WITHOUT their AAPL job... you're just kicking them when they're down. 

I grew up poor on a low-tech farm, this sort of virtue-signalling by killing the poor is horrible./n<pos> @chhlss Idk but I learned a while ago that the best thing to buy is $AAPL stock/n<pos> That's alright. That's ok. I was waiting for money to clear so I can buy the dip anyway

But it is time to split the stock, stuck at $3000, and let the investors enjoy the move like many others: aapl, tsla, ...

Grateful to your AWS and other services - making life easier during pandemic./n<pos> @TheStalwart AAPL could add $5 to its share price if it did a tax-free spin of the air pods business.  I'm sure of it./n<pos> Stopped out those weekly 126 calls on AAPL to salvage the balance on it.  I'm good with the stock for now.
-30% on the call premiums on those. Got .57 back on the .89 outlay.

124.66 fib on the daily still putting up resistance from the open./n<pos> Closed out the $AAPL and $AMD calls I've been holding for a couple weeks. Nice gain, gave some back due to theta/premium burn with choppy stock price action

Converted to shares, now holding both names but large stock positions instead of options/n<neu> @7Innovator I would choose AAPl/n<neg> With $FB and $SNOW in the books I'm done for today, $AAPL too choppy for me‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è/n<pos> As an $AAPL shareholder I hope people buy these like hot cakes ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> I don‚Äôt know how $AAPL got another $600 out of me this year... but there it is/n<neu> At this point I hop $FSLY gets bought out so I don't have to deal with this rollercoaster anymore. Preferably let $AAPL be the buyer. I'll take an all stock deal. Thanks./n<pos> @LilMoonLambo Even without $BTC, I always bought the same amount of Apple gear and $AAPL stock together since 2010. All of these stuff is now free!/n<neu> My spouse needs to upgrade from an iPhone 6s; do I buy an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 12 Mini? (iPhone 12 or 12 Pro is not in the running). $AAPL/n<neg> Looks like $AAPL is going to need a daily close above 125 for it to truly break out. Anything under that I‚Äôm not touching it/n<neg> @RobinhoodApp get your network, and content delivery on point, your crappy delays are costing me money. #PLTR #FSR #AAPL #TSLA/n<pos> I need $aapl to hit 125 today. Thanks./n<neu> i am telling you today that if you can buy and hold this stock for 30 years you will be sitting on something akin to $AAPL at $.65 avg in in 1990's..../n<pos> @lehtimaeki As an $AAPL stockholder I approve those prices./n<pos> @Ericccccccc2 $aapl had been acting well.  I‚Äôm long from last week/n<neu> I‚Äôm probably grabbing SPY, AAPL, and SQ calls this morning/n<neu> $AAPL Apple could block apps that don't comply with new privacy feature

Not buying Apple because of their fitness product - I like the headphones üéß they announced today./n<pos> and yes I bought some overpriced headphones as gifts bc unlike console manufacturers $MSFT $SNE, these will actually be available before Christmas $AAPL/n<neu> It will be quite a while before I can justify $550 headphones. With $aapl I‚Äôm sure they are great, but that is quite a price point./n<neg> @neilcybart Agree.  The fallacy here is rooted in the desire to call everything a ‚Äúsubscription business‚Äù so people who know nothing about the business will value it more highly.

It makes no sense. The again, they say, ‚Äúcommon sense is the least common of all senses‚Äù. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

AAPL üöÄ/n<pos> @BurnerBroncos It definitely helps to hear others perspectives.  I am heavily in AAPL, RKT and JD so I will start small here.

This is what happen if you buy Stock üëáüëáüëá/n<neu> @ValueAnalyst1 @munster_gene Hey @ValueAnalyst1 - I remember you saying $TSLA market cap. will be greater than $AAPL by 2025. So why the $2T hashtag. Are you concerned about rate of growth rather than growth at that point? or is it more of cross/reach the bridge scenario/n<pos> @StuSim I‚Äôm just been moving away from mega caps even though I think most of them are undervalued and focusing more on small/mid caps with more growth potential. 

But I think $GOOG $AMZN $AAPL $FB $MSFT could have a strong 2021. $FB and $AMZN are the cheapest of the 5./n<pos> The reason I love these stocks and $SPY for options.  They don‚Äôt disappoint or play games on the chart. Once it‚Äôs ready, it‚Äôs a go time.
$MSFT $AAPL $FB $BABA $TSLA $ROKU $NFLX $ZM $NVDA $DIS @OptionsPastor/n<neu> @umarashraf28 $aapl is a dud... I could double my money in some other stock until apple decides to move from 124 to 125/n<neu> Game.  I lend you for free $10k to invest only in one of these 2: $GOOG/$GOOGL or $AAPL 
In 5 years you give me back the 10k and keep the profits. 

Which one you pick?/n<neg> So I got iPhone 12 Pro Max and don't like it. Feels too bulky, almost indistinguishable screen size and quality improvement, and hate the shiny bezel. Switching back to my trusty iPhone 11 Pro Max. (After using 12 for nearly a week, the 11 feels compact.)

$AAPL/n<pos> No need to say if it opens below thos or that it‚Äôs bullish or bearish. This US bullish I assure you $spy $spx $es $aapl $goog $tsla $amzn/n<pos> @Ricksalin @FalconWingFail @Tesla Unpredictable, but I think they get a majority of the market for the foreseeable future.  At what point do software, communications, and cars converge/merge?  MSFT/TSLA GOOG/TSLA AAPL/TSLA are all interesting combos./n<pos> I‚Äôm telling y‚Äôall get in on $GHIV ! Trending on Stocktwits, dividend after merger, easily will see $20+. Lets gooooo

$IPOC $VLDR $PSTH $AMCI $GIX $TSLA $RKT $KODK $AAPL $PFE/n<pos> @pierre_rochard @BarrySilbert ...AAPL or AMZN or.....MSTR.
S and P 500 company, marginable, so- buy MSTR, get collateralized loan, buy bitcoin. Too easy. Better than other way around,  bitcoin collateralized loans that I‚Äôve seen have higher rates./n<neu> Also have entry holds on $AAPL, $CRM, $NIO, and $ZM (I do question myself on holding $ZM now, but I do see a path for it to make a revival in the next few days). Will ramp up on these once I start to see the move./n<neu> @pakpakchicken I think AAPL and AMZN are overdue for this kind of jump out of their current 'wedge'.../n<neu> lol  f me  where tiny tim on fast money  2500 target in 3  yrs that 12500..

Tesla Gets $2,500 3-Year Target From Munster, But Analyst Sees Apple As A Roadblock In EV Maker's Path $TSLA $AAPL/n<neu> @AlexanderSzews I guess we‚Äôll find out. For now, it appears this is W5. The bigger question is: W5 of what bigger cycle? And the key to all of it is aapl, amzn, fb, and googl not making a higher high. Does that mean they already completed, or are going to drag everything up?/n<neu> @SqueezeMetrics From this chart, it seems like price moved down first before the IV moved down. What caused that initial price move down? I don't remember any catalyst at that time for AAPL to move down and retail were buying like crazy./n<neg> @McVu Realistically, I‚Äôm thinking more 120-121 before this thing takes off.

When $AAPL gaps up, it GAPS THE EFF UP. However, the payback for those gap ups is just horrendous./n<neu> @Rand0mGuest2 I've referred to this phenomenon previously as the "mom multiple" (see $AAPL and $LULU). Once your parents start onboarding you know it's gone mainstream.

Maybe with #bitcoin it will be the Dad Diversification?/n<neu> @ryanoistacher Yeah, I meant nothing negative on $AAPL or any of the others...just making the point that Buffett is constrained by size to larger-cap companies. We as smaller investors aren‚Äôt, so we should take that into consideration./n<neu> @loudmouthjulia I hope $AAPL tells him to shove it/n<pos> Red day for the market but a 1% gain for me. Thank you #AAPL #TSLA and #NIO/n<pos> @7Innovator Risk-adjusted, I'm taking $AAPL. Solid revenue and positioned for multi-year growth in services and the Mac business (esp. now that the reviews are out on their own chips). Low downside and still significant upside./n<neu> @NeilWindham i sold a huge block of AAPL for a 10 bagger about 15 years ago. i thought that was the trade of my life at the time/n<neu> @PickStocks3 I personally think around within this or the next 2 weeks imo. Has to play catch up with $AAPL and $FB/n<neu> Going to add more $FUBO $AAPL and $PLTR shares this week like what I‚Äôve seen/n<neu> @PrestonPysh @max_power45789 @AFSILO @michael_saylor Exactly right. Think about how much wiser a debt-raise this is compared to, e.g., AAPL taking on debt to buy back its stock, as they have done multiple times over the past several years (i.e., due to how screwed up the US bond and stock markets are at the moment)./n<pos> @NeverSellAmazon I seem to follow many people who are bullish on $AMZN $FB $NFLX $AAPL $BABA and other large-cap stocks that are just puttering around right now.  I personally don't have any of them, but it will be interesting to see how they do move in the next month./n<neg> @beach_trades its up,   but a few tickers are not working for me #AAPL,  $LYFT/n<neu> @anandchokkavelu I dunno. I still think he‚Äôd Own aapl. 5G baby!/n<neu> @Matt_Cochrane7 @maybebullish I still stuck in $AAPL buying $DIS, and $AMZN or $SNE buying $VIAC, and as a bonus, Canadian media company $CJR.B./n<pos> @SirDigALot I am heavily invested in $AAPL. I am expecting them to hit $3 Trillion in Valuation in 2021. People think that‚Äôs crazy, but I know what‚Äôs in their pipeline./n<neg> @PandaOptions @TrendSpider I‚Äôd be more worried about $AAPL than the lego car/n<neu> @Jollibeestocks I got out of aapl and pton for profit, but lost on Amazon February calls. Any thoughts on$amzn?/n<neu> @DividendGrowth For me it was $AAPL/n<pos> @Jollibeestocks and you handled the AAPL contracts a lot better than I did.  I  only sold a few.  Still holding quite a few./n<neg> Dan Ives back at it again! $aapl 160$ pt. Can‚Äôt say I disagree but he‚Äôs always wrong/n<neu> @TLPrivate_ @RayTL_ So I was traveling today and missed the pull back in the afternoon. I peeled off some exposure on AAPL(small loss) FVRR (25% gain) was stopped out of Amd (break even) pton (small loss). However I came into SQQQ 17.35 at the top basically but saw serious pressure on my holdings./n<neu> @PikesPeakTrades I actually left $FB once it lost $280 then re-added at $270 same goes for $AAPL. Added $JD $SLV $GDX $AMD $CRM $NIO. But I did get pretty beat up in the process mostly because I was so bullish on $TSLA and decided to do a weekly :P/n<neu> @Jollibeestocks RKT positions I started a couple days ago evened out my aapl and baba positions. Started a position in RIDE- check out that wave count, lmk what you think ü§î/n<pos> @Jollibeestocks @puppy_trades @WarlusTrades @TriggerTrades 
I want to personally thank you for all the insights. It has built up my confidence more on trading and having a closer look into the charts.
üíØ $TSLA $AAPL $DOCU $RKT $PLUG $SE and waiting for $CRM/n<neu> If you haven‚Äôt noticed I don‚Äôt move with the crowd, I rather fly above the crowd that way I see what‚Äôs up ahead. $NIO $XPEV $LI $TSLA $QS $AAPL/n<neu> Might have to buy more AAPL after this article I just read üòØ/n<neu> Anyone up for more stocks levels for 10/12/2020?

$FB $AAPL $TSLA $roku $zm $AMD $PLTR $NIO/n<pos> @bobbibillard @chazzofsheckys Can't go wrong with $AAPL that's for sure.
As for Telehealth, I've been in $TDOC for a lil while and after the merge with $LVGO which I owned, my position has become pretty large but I'll take a look at $AMWL 
Thanks!/n<neu> All I have to say is $AAPL üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠/n<neu> I‚Äôm loading $sfor and not missing out like I did on $aapl, $tsla, $amzn, $btc/n<pos> @AndreyShcherbi6 My $QQQ short is going well, I'm still holding some overnight

$GE calls are also up quite nicely, I took some profit, riding over half of my original $ in it

$AAPL is -90%. Just holding til expiry now incase a white-swan comes by Friday/n<neu> Sold one of my February AAPL calls early on then hit TSLA calls for $115 win but still holding longer term stuff that pulled me down so a red day but I still have time on my long term stuff. Bought TSLA on the 3-2-2 30m reversal but didn‚Äôt have FTFC so took it off early for win/n<neg> @7News I‚Äôve gotten only the one 1200-dollar stimulus payment. Many people, like me, do not qualify for unemployment benefits because of long-term unemployment. If I were giving it out, it would be just stimulus payments./n<neu> @ChnNewbee Definitely weighed on my portfolio, AMD AAPL and APPS all hurt today, but they're all long swings, none are day trades. Managed to finish very solidly in the green thanks to the panic buys

I have trailing stop losses on each, if they hit they hit. For now all still holding all/n<neu> @Quarry_Rock @ElaineBenes99 Give me $aapl at 116-117 tomorrow and I‚Äôll buy/n<neg> @BuckinghamWyatt Today is Dec 09 Wednesday

Some of those $AAPL Bearish shares hit the market! Plus, b4 that $AAPL wasn't really moving.

I didn't see anything on your page about $AAPL going to be pulling back./n<neu> @SunriseTrader $AAPL, $TWLO, $SNAP heading towards a swing, but not there yet and all others are already there or past the swing...in my books...but I'm new to this. üòâ/n<pos> Well that was quite the shopping spree, I started  the morning with a bit of $TSLA added some more $SHOP $PINS and $SFT and couldn‚Äôt leave $AAPL behind. Started a position in $LMND and increased my ETF‚Äôs in $TAN $ICLN $ARKK $ARKW and $ARKF overall a good day!/n<neu> @wizard_trading You were on point in terms of price targets and timing. Incredible!

I should have given up on $AAPL yesterday... it's actually been a stinker compared to my expectations and made clear we weren't getting a true melt up.

You said you'd reveal how you knew this coming. Please do!/n<pos> Red days on the market are buying opportunities my friends. Buy the dip. 

Loaded more more $AAPL today. The big payday will come soon for me üòÅ/n<pos> @Herben31 On bad days like this, right before close you see where big money is comfortable being. And usually I‚Äôm pretty comfortable being there too üòÇ $AAPL always solid/n<pos> Man O man... I am FULLY SATISFIED with that $AAPL 125.39 TEST AND PUKE TODAY... THAT WAS A BEAUTIFUL THANG.../n<neu> @DontFeedBear Been trying OTM the last two weeks. Feel like I‚Äôm missing something with it.  Had quite a few AAPL. When I sold this week, profits surely were smaller than the itm calls I sold but the risk was much smaller as well.  I‚Äôm sure that CRM premium would‚Äôve been over a thousand more./n<neu> @The_RockTrading Hi. Can you define ‚Äú dark cloud forming ‚Äú ? Making sure I am understanding your read of the charts. Sounds like beware but then you mention the higher call number. AAPL is 25% of my portfolio. Thanks./n<pos> @TheMarkCooke @dyerchase @Matt_Cochrane7 With heavy heart I reduced portfolio size by half and got out of margin. Best day was to do this when I had green morning :). Updated position with reduced size $ipoc $sfix $fb $msft $sq $se $zm $twtr $aapl $falr $pton $roku $pags $stne $uber $lyft $shop/n<neu> Call me crazy but buying $AAPL and $AMD calls on this dip.

Many (myself included) might be underestimating $aapl./n<neg> $AAPL wtf man lol I had hope for $130 eow/n<neu> $AAPL Wish I would have sold some covered calls around lunchtime/n<neg> @FradeDuarte Maybe I‚Äôm sleeping on $aapl. P&amp;L for AirPods alone would be insane./n<neg> @CNBC What I don‚Äôt get is how are these Wall Street companies raking in trillions, while the average American is receiving crumbs? $AAPL, almost a 2T company, and the fed bought their bonds, $AMZN, $MSFT, even $TSLA, have all doubled their capital. Yet, 600-1200 is an issue? Wtf!?/n<neg> @odzer I want to know why did you interview the wedbush idiot today!? That pumped the junk AAPL!/n<pos> @ntfri when to go LT on $AAPL ?? I'm seeing around $116-117 as good entry.  Thoughts?/n<neg> @khizeranwar786 Aapl not treating me well rn üíîüòî/n<neu> $AAPL I took another rung of the ladder to reduce risk +3.91 still holding plenty of shares with some cushion now.  Stop at b/e area/n<neg> I dont understand why people are picking on $fb over buying out competitors. What the fuck. If I had a company with no revenue and they bought me out at a billion...... fuck it. I'm happy as hell. $SPY $QQQ $AAPL $TSLA/n<neu> @mukund I think faang is the oppty here. Most have been trading sideways for 3-5 months. $amzn and $aapl/n<neu> I'm still keeping all my positions. If the sell off continues tomorrow, then I'll close all. All my options are Jan expiry and OTM. 

$AAPL $MSFT $AMZN $FB $NVDA $BABA $TSLA/n<neg> Idk what I did to $AAPL but I‚Äôm sorry./n<neg> Now just fix the share button. I requested custom made , not to go in circles $aapl/n<neu> @TheDonCallis @KennyOmegamanX Mr Invisible Hand, please push up the price of AAPL stock for me today on the market. Now that I know who controls the market, it's time to influence./n<pos> $spy today‚Äôs a good day to prepare next options you wanna enter for monthly chart plays that haven‚Äôt hit their monthly up extensions yet

I‚Äôm eyeing $msft $fb $nvda $aapl so far 

That list will grow tonight and tomorrow/n<neu> @PrivatePRT I understand there is news in play, but technically speaking the outlook seems relatively grim for AAPL with respect to the breakout from 123, any thoughts here? I‚Äôm still considering the action on this stock an important element of broader context at current levels/n<neu> @Post_Market In that regard, I often compare AAPL to COST or vice versa.  They both become curator and the most dominant influencer in peoples buying decision in respective areas.  Per Porter‚Äôs theory, those who have the most influence in value chain shall reap the most value/margins./n<neu> @RedDogT3 And I do what to state this is on low vol 29mil SPY any jump will cause this to pick up speed AAPL has lost 8dma every this is on the line!/n<neu> $AAPL holding. Exactly what I said I was worried about yesterday happened with a pullback so I bought small.

I want to ask you your thoughts on my assets: AMD, SPCE, AAPL/n<neg> @h_cole864 I think I will lose all my aapl profit.  Is ok. There have been worse trades haha.  For saying bad things about the revolutionary new headphones, I deserve this./n<pos> @dannyvena @themotleyfool $AAPL is a LTBH for me Danny.
Thanks for the ongoing coverage of companies I own./n<neu> @reciknows I feel like you are charting my entire portfolio at this point. $AAPL, $NIO, $TSLA, $RKT, $MSFT..../n<pos> Market pulling back. This is why I like to buy time on my contracts. $SPY $SPX $SQ $TWTR $AAPL/n<neg> @HsakaTrades Jfc, this is why I‚Äôm not a fan of tokenized securities. 

Do you really need to be trading AAPL at 3am on a Saturday with a couple hundred people at a price that‚Äôs completely divorced from reality/n<pos> @jposhaughnessy @peteweishaupt Always ahead of the curve. I assume AAPL is sending some recruiters your way./n<neg> I couldn't imagine being the person that ALWAYS needed the latest $AAPL iPhone

5yrs ago the ASP of the iPhone was $670

Assume the same ASP for the past 5yrs

Instead of an updated iPhone, you invest that money EACH year and earned an annual avg 10% return, you would have $4,100/n<pos> @LookAtTheVolume For me the pieces went into place on that $AAPL test today/n<pos> $RKT - then we see 23. 
$AAPL - good flow this morning but needs to take out 125 and hold. then we see next leg up 
$JWS - new position added. todays daily is meh but i like this one. 
$PTON - my fav chart within my open positions, aside from yesterday news i like this to 126/n<neg> Is anyone actually going to pay $549 for $AAPL Air Pod Max?  Seems like tone deaf pricing coming from a monopolistic behemoth to me.  I‚Äôll pass./n<neu> @GabrielUtasi @CAinvest0r So true I‚Äôm watching $AAPL go through it now/n<neu> @ku1deep I‚Äôd rather put the $549 into AAPL stock./n<pos> @KyleMorpheus This is an interesting take. 

If a $BTC etf comes out, not so sure but i's unlikely.

If an index comes out MSTR becomes the $AAPL to $SPY of that index.

If no etf, $MSTR is the etf.

2/3 scenarios say if $BTC remains bullish this will work./n<neu> @MMeatloaf7 How do you feel about $AAPL the rest of the week?/n<neu> SWEEP DETECTED:

Discipline yourself to be precise with how you enter trades, not sloppy/n<neg> These recent efforts by $AAPL (Fitness+ and $549 headphones) will be major flops. I see a co. that has forgotten how to innovate. 

It wouldn't be the first time they've come late the party, with a shitty, more exy gift and redefined the whole segment. I don't see it this time./n<neg> @Trading_Boxes Good week overall, but $SPY and $AAPL have been more erratic than I'd like.

ETH = Internet of Money 
Defi = AAPL, FB, AMZN etc

Defi is built on top of ETH internet. 

Wealth didn't go to the 'internet', it went to all the businesses built on top./n<pos> @ericjdubs Good question. I use stops as decision space during pullbacks &amp; especially volatile ones which can happen on HOD trades. $4 is good for $TSLA, $ZM. $2 maybe for $NVDA these days. $1 for $AAPL, $ROKU, $FB, $MSFT. A lot of this is based on watching the same stocks everyday./n<neg> @truthhurts10989 Well, what has ANY publicly traded company done to validate their stock price?

Why risk it?/n<neu> @KevinJ38361621 Yes, I use ADR much more in index futures and futures in stocks. It still works well in the "core" confluence stocks like $AAPL $MSFT. I do NOT use it for an "in play" momentum stock, because of obvious reasons (something has changed by definition and averages aren't relevant)/n<pos> @investor_2 Welcome to the SPAC community! 

Not to offend anyone, but even a 12-year old gets it. Most 12-year-olds are smart! 

BTW, I was also such a history nerd at 12. Wish I could just buy one $AAPL at that time. I was such a Steve Jobs fanboy. Luckily, I later doubled down on Tesla./n<pos> @mukund I actually see "China stocks" doing very well in 2021.
It is weird how companies like $TSLA &amp; $AAPL who manufacture their products in China avoid scrutiny from U.S. media &amp; politicians yet companies like $BABA &amp; $BYDDF are portrayed as such a threat to investors?/n<pos> I held my few $AAPL stocks for years, enjoyed the subsequent rise, but eventually started selling a few here and there.

It‚Äôll spend the next 3 years churning between 150-200, then regain growth trajectory end of 2023. $AAPL/n<neu> Given these PE scenarios + the current WFH/durable goods bull market + the technical setup in both Nasdaq &amp; Apple + the likelihood of inflation/bonds killing the growth trade next Summer, I think there‚Äôs a scenario setting up for Medimum Term Top (3 yr) in Q1 $AAPL/n<pos> This explains the current multiple of 37x, even though Apple only grew at 10.44% last year (which bears are constantly pointing out.) Analysts know what‚Äôs coming. But I believe the highest estimate on the street rn is $1.58 for Q1. Those need to come up. A lot. 

$AAPL/n<neu> I believe these estimates are prob low and will release my estimates closer to earnings in late Jan when we have some more optics on holidays.

Or slide it the opposite direction. I'm an AAPL shareholder and I'm not this stupid for them loool/n<neu> @HReynal You have to see $MSFT closer. I held it for a long while. Until Satya became the CEO the stock went nowhere. Same for $AAPL/n<pos> @DontFeedBear @StrawHatStocks I'm ready for $AAPL and $CRM to take off!/n<neg> Well this is embarrassing. The day I thought was a low volume trading day  was actually the day after Thanksgiving, a half day of trading. Fortuntaley I bought $AAPL and $AMD on a pullback after a breakout and don't buy assumed pivots. Hopefully the breakouts continue./n<neu> @caleb_investTML @BrianFeroldi @mukund @profgalloway @saxena_puru @TheMarkCooke @JonahLupton @LuoshengPeng Do they have client concentration risk ?

(I used to follow the aapl trader forum)/n<pos> @Critica96592064 @S_Andreoni Well I did buy $AAPL when he said buy and never sell. Then he said buy Apple again and again and I bought more and more. Do I think he sells the sizzle instead of the steak? YES. Has he made me good money on the follow?  YES. There are lots of investors that share the sentiment./n<neg> @CalebJHull They‚Äôre $550? Seriously? WTF. I‚Äôm so going long $AAPL on Monday. I know how stupid consumers are./n<neu> @The_RockTrading I thought we already broke out the triangle (drawing the trend line with last 2 highs), the move you mentionning has already started ! I mean, charting is very subjective so yours makes sense too, and conclusion is the same: $AAPL road to ATH üöÄüöÄüöÄ/n<neu> Rough day to trade today. I continue to hold $AAPL, $BB &amp; $PLUG. I will hold $BB through earnings.

Remember to set stops &amp; stick to them. I am of the mind that I only trade what I‚Äôm okay losing so I don‚Äôt normally set stops. I‚Äôve had options go to -90% to then comeback for a üí∞./n<pos> @ProTrader_Vini there was huge SPY, AAPL and RTY buying that took place few minutes after the close.

The other one with decent size blocks was FB/n<neg> I‚Äôm getting fucking smoked by $AMZN &amp; $AAPL/n<neu> @psychikmoksha Yes, I spread my 12/18 $AAPL puts today. Loaded 12/24 puts today.

The reasons that $AAPL couldn't break $120 last week is also the same reason it SHOULD breakdown below $120 this week. üßä/n<neg> @PeterTrader99 $nvda, $aapl, and basically all large cap tech has been just crappy every day. i think im just going to put all my money into $roku and $crwd/n<neu> FOMC meeting Wednesday.

The market may hold into Wednesday, but we will see another sell again this week.

Both are small positions, 100 shares each.  Selling the $AAPL to buy more $TSLA is probably the better transaction, me thinks, and leave $GE as is./n<neu> $aapl has all my attention right now... on the breakout I‚Äôm loading the boat. Will keep you all updated/n<neu> @jimcramer $aapl is down today by .5% and volume is below average... I think it will skyrocket to all time high as holiday season is coming up../n<neu> @photojack I am not planning to buy the 12, but buying 12 shares of AAPL is not a bad idea./n<pos> @kejialabii Good one.

I have 2 shares of $AAPL/n<neu> @zerohedge I mean...doesn‚Äôt take an Einstein to tell you that once the vaccine is out...It‚Äôs like saying $AAPL will be higher this time next year/n<neg> for a moment i thought i lost it.  $AAPL $PTON were both 121.77, same nosedive, same size bar down.  accidentally sold AAPL instead of pton./n<neu> Like I said, you were WARNED! $SPY $AMZN $AAPL $TSLA/n<pos> @puppy_trades hey boss, i dont think anything has changed but any new update of $CRM, $NVDA, $BABA, $AAPL, $ZM ? thank you/n<neg> @TheAroraReport Vaccine- Pton up

Let‚Äôs hope it‚Äôs up with stimulus?!  Or will stimulus be a sell the news $AAPL $NIO etc/n<neu> @joealertz I‚Äôm still holding my 25 year $5.75 call on $AAPL from 1997... should I sell it yet @joealertz  ? üòÇ/n<neg> spare me the pearl-clutching about Tim Cook killing a show about Gawker

writers and producers are free to sell it elsewhere

there is no law that says $AAPL has to fund things that displease its CEO ppl need to grow tf up/n<neu> I think the only new Apple products available for Christmas delivery are the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini (and nobody wants either). 

Biggest threat to a bullish ‚Äúsuper-cycle‚Äù thesis is supply. How much is supply constrained by COVID? Cause everything is sold out. 

$AAPL/n<neg> @Jollibeestocks @StockPrinter While you are kicking BABA smack the shit out of AAPL and MSFT for me./n<pos> I‚Äôm happy that #aapl incremented the version of macOS to 11, this is the year that  truly represents change. WinTel has been left in the dust!/n<pos> my swings are also doing pretty good... $DDOG $FSLY $PENN $DKNG $AMD $AMZN(leaps) $SPOT $SE $AAPL these are all my holdings. posted when i went long on my feed just look for the entries. Trimming as they climb higher and also adding on dips.

Or theta for &amp;tsla is smaller, less erosion of time than other stocks./n<pos> @Freeeethinker1 @EWoodhouse7 Exactly. What‚Äôs COVID? Other than a made up hoax that allowed me to buy stocks like $TSLA at 80 $NVDA at 195 $AMZN 1600 $AAPL 213. Thanks COVID. Another bonus is my CNN-Scared üí©-less MIL never stops over !/n<neu> Owning up to my mistake and selling $AAPL at a slim profit. I'm holding $AMD though. The breakout looks like it's coming. Stop loss is in place to minimize risk./n<neg> Journalist @KaraSwisher on CNBC responding to report that Apple TV killed Gawker Media project: "It's not a great look for Apple, it certainly makes Tim Cook look petty, but it's his network...I totally can believe he did that." $AAPL/n<neu> @ChroniclesNate Buy aapl amzn.  I already had the skills to manage my credit./n<pos> $STM
 strong intraday recovery today. With the vertical integration across the semi-conductor sectors and Huawei's/China supply chain issues, makes 
$STM a prime take-out target  in full or part - EU would bless the deal, just like 
$ARMH

They are just ripping us off with an iPhone 12 that has comes with no charger or headphone..."carbon emission" excuse, ha! Just realized it, as I was ordering a new iPhone this morning. Damn, sneaky bastards!/n<pos> I like aapl here not showing weakness with spy drop. I‚Äôm in with 120c this week exp./n<neu> @packyM When $Aapl was trading at PE 8 told myself it's because 1 trillion market co is too dear. Glad I'm passed that size anchoring bias./n<neu> Closed $HD Dec 18 $265 call this morning for 95%

Opened a swing position in $NIO Dec 31 $45 call. I think this can be a multi bagger.

Still holding $RKT, $AAPL, $EBAY 

Watching $MSFT, $FB, $NFLX, $ACB, $NVDA/n<neu> I‚Äôm saying this all as someone who‚Äôs invested in both $AAPL and $PTON, and who has a bike and treadmill compatible with both platforms.

What happens next doesn‚Äôt depend on what either brand‚Äôs devoted fans hope for, it depends on what the millions of dabblers decide to do./n<neu> Losing Monday. Wasn‚Äôt much out there at open but I still tried, should of sat back and watched. -0.93R on $AAPL &amp; -0.33R on $BABA. Keep the losers small and onto the next day. +7.86R for December/n<pos> @X51777982 but I can still fine tune my risk by moving stop to breakeven when I can. Today on aapl are break even with options but the potential was a big win.  Will wait till tomorrow as the market is kind of sluggish for me./n<neu> Today at 9:41 AM
$AAPL out for now/n<neu> @jposhaughnessy @BullandBaird I think PSR is quite useful and you really opened my eyes to it. I guess my only critique would be to "sales are sales b/c they are unadorned by accounting." In fact, for many companies like $AAPL booked sales are much lower than actual sales, due to accounting standards./n<neu> @NorthernNomadNN @charliemale Can you please help me try to put $AAPL out of business too? Go buy as many iPhones as you can./n<pos> $ATVI, $JNJ, $AAPL, $HON, $KTOS, $FLGT are my biggest watches today.  Have a ton of meetings so won't be too active but will post when I can.  Trade smart./n<neg> Oh Windows! It‚Äôs been a long time since I don‚Äôt use you.... to remember old times suffering, my first restart is happening today üòä #AAPL vs #MSFT/n<pos> @chesterinvest @Tesla @NIOGlobal fuck I love #fintwit for this.. for this info right away..  Cheers for posting.. If AAPL goes down I'm guessing thee S&amp;P 500 will follow.. and a little burst will occur. Do you concur?/n<neu> @TraderBJones On the first signs of a major sell off I would buy SPXU or SQQQ. If everything went back down to March lows I would buy lots of ENPH, ETSY, AAPL, MRNA, and TSLA/n<neu> @BitcoinMises @tamburmajor @cranialaug @rajavick I don't know about that conduit, but surely the Fed printing $USD to buy $AAPL bonds, which are in turn then used to fund stock buybacks leads to obvious asset inflation, no?/n<pos> @TraderBJones I will pick Ciena $CIEN and Aviat Networks $AVNW. Either $AAPL or $AMZN will do OK./n<neg> @RetirementRight Just before $AAPL $MSFT earnings I tweited I was shorting them &amp; why. They would beat huge, but bc 1 time "black swan" event, WFM &amp; LFM schools closed parents had to buy new computers. The kicker neither Co. could issue future guidance &amp; that's what markets look for. Both tanked./n<pos> Will be releasing more sexy picks this week!

I asked if I would be eating steak or cat food on my birthday sept 3. 89% of people said cat food. 2 weeks later i was up 162%. People are dumb/n<neu> @SawyerMerritt $TSLA and $AAPL as I‚Äôm an Ô£ø employee./n<neu> @SawyerMerritt @ChrisDungeon That tells me $aapl is cheap üòÇ/n<neu> @garyblack00 Interesting, however I dont think you can compare the two companies, investors like you and me expect $TSLA to become some sort of monopoly or duopoly just like $AMZN, $AAPL, $MSFT, $FB, $GOOGL.

I‚Äôll let you know how it goes $NIO $39/n<neu> @FLGatorTrader Personally, I'm loaded to the brim. Calls on $AAPL and $IVZ. Long ur $SLV call too./n<pos> @GerberKawasaki When I first bought aapl over 20 years ago I knew Jobs would go onto great things! It was a no brainer just like Bitcoin.  Cook has done well navigating the ship but no much of a risk taker./n<neu> @BarrySchwartzBW I‚Äôm a bit confused Barry, you always talk about on BNN how you‚Äôve trimmed (sold) $AAPL over the years for your clients. How does that square with #neversell ?/n<neu> $AAPL - This has basically been flat since Sept. This doesn't sit right with the rest of tech moving up in that time frame. Bounced nicely off the 21 MA last week. Get through some resistance around $125 and I think $AAPL catches up./n<neg> @SawyerMerritt @chrisco72150659 I have to disagree with you soundly. AAPL was a fully mature company with a reasonable PE when Jobs died. TSLA would get a 60-80% haircut without Elon and still would be pricey from a valuation standpoint. I am not sure the trajectory of the company would be fully intact either./n<neu> @saxena_puru Hey Puru, IMO, right now is the stratification of Tech/digital 2.0, separation of boys from men, if I may. While you cant discount the powerhouses like aapl, msft, amzn, i feel the difference vs other decades is in much pointed and aggressive competition and edge creation./n<pos> @saxena_puru I agree there is a lot of froth in parts of the market but $AMZN more than doubled from 2000 -2012 and $AAPL was up 21X during the same time./n<neu> @MissionWinners Hi Hope this makes sense. I‚Äôm trying to figure out when to use a d/w sloping trend line verses taking out the recent days hi. Ex. AAPL why not use hi from 9/2 or 10/13 to 12/9 hi for a d/w trendline for an entry price?  Thanks/n<neu> Watchlist:

$ROKU - Holding a 12/18 340 call I think $350 test is coming

$AMD - Consolidating for a move to test $100?

$TGT - Cup and Handle on the Daily?

$AAPL - Ascending triangle? Has lagged. Over $125ish I think this catches up

$BABA - Selling over? Nice pitchfork/n<neu> @ryanoistacher @mukund I could make an argument that all of the 2,400 "American" companies owned by Chinese firms are "influenced" by the CCP...
With @AMCTheatres &amp; @Forbes both owned by China, the influence is all around us.
$AAPL &amp; $TSLA obviously must obey some CCP rules to manufacture within China./n<neu> $AAPL makes up 22% of $BRK's market cap./n<pos> @ElaineBenes99 My Lord !   1965  - I have the $AAPL TV - We will all watch. Thanks/n<neu> @PleaseStacy @semil What i meant is that for goog, Amzn, aapl and msft you had several 10x returns as public cos before they were worth $1 trillion/n<neu> @Kobedobydoo Yep. I never expected it to run that hard in the first place today. I would have taken the profits and run. But $AAPL has been dormant for a while so could keep running, especially if $QQQ and the overall market keep rolling.

I just prefer other tech that‚Äôs been lagging.../n<pos> $AAPL quiere ATH and I am here for it/n<neu> OK, that's enough charts. Also traded $CWH, $OSTK, + $NKE. All very similar set-ups (like $AAPL + $AMD). There's alot of them if you look around, so many that I can't physically take them all w/o running out of $$$.
No set-ups tonight. Will trade whatever is moving tmra.
HAGN! üçª/n<neu> @BWUIC Yes. MY latest are #TSLA #SPY, #AAPL,  and I‚Äôm very close to drop my long term #CVX position. Also considering dropping #ABBV since next year it might go lower. What about you, Paul?/n<pos> just under -$7 for my AAPL shares. I like gambling./n<neu> @wolftradingbg An iPhone.
I heard $aapl if ramping up production by 30% to give away iPhones to people buying their stocks...
Just saying. .../n<neu> @trendwhizo @Stocktwits Anecdotal I believe since $AAPL hasn't actually released iPhone12 sales figures from Oct-Dec./n<pos> @MillennialBaggy $AAPL first even after today. 
The rest bullish to neutral heading into earnings season next month.
$AMZN is driving me crazy lol/n<pos> Putting a $20B market cap target on $JAMF.. I love slapping 2x TAM on these disruptive growth companies! As Apple‚Äôs $AAPL ecosystem grows.. so will Jamf and Jamf Nation! 

I want a board seat!/n<neu> @FlippinKiks @CJ_Johnson17th It's all opportunity cost. He made serious money with other names. $AAPL was actually stalled at under $120 for a long time... I do believe they are now breaking out to $150 easily./n<pos> Paid off my business in 2019, paid off my house in 2020, now I‚Äôm debt free and 90% of every dollar I make I can invest in 2021. Invest in yourself before stocks! My 1st buys will be 99 more $AAPL to make it an even 500 shares and probably some more $TSLA long term hold 5-10 years/n<pos> @67Dodge AAPL is a high-quality company, so I would reduce the holding over a 4-5 year period as other companies offer good entry points./n<pos> $AAPL has a 131.17 gap fill and 131.45 fib I liked
/ES to 3718.50 daily RSI = 70 around the same time for the love of God would be amazing./n<pos> @Kaz9837 Sure agree. I am just interested in PTON always and AAPL since I am looking to start a option soon./n<neu> Yesterday I rolled $AAPL weekly 125's into fewer Jan 130's. Nice fail on my part./n<neu> Been touting staying long $aapl since $107 floor held, everybody jumped on train today, so I secured some profits n will reload if weakness shows which I‚Äôm sure it will after $20 move in two weeks/n<pos> Most of my $SPACs were down today (except $RIDE &amp; $BTWN)

$AAPL $POLA $TLRY $NIO $TAN $DIS $VSTO &amp; others more-than saved the day for me.

Don't be afraid to diversify your exposures./n<neu> @drefleury @TradingWithCody @codywillard From what I understand, Space revolution will be huge over the next ten years and more. From my point of view, just one of his high conviction trades would pay for years of his subscription. I lost track of Cody for years but remember when he pounded the table for AAPL yrs ago./n<pos> @TrungTPhan Thanks for helping me see just how undervalued $AAPL stock is!/n<pos> @DavisTrades I followed it on $AAPL today and it worked like a charm. I used the morning pre-market as the low and it bounced right off .5 fib./n<neu> @ParrotStock I actually sold before the news, just at the beggining of the session. So I didnt consider that. I might enter in the future, who knows? Also $AAPL , $NIO and $ETSY carried my portfolio today üôå/n<neu> @lopiansky @lessin I've been to Ô£øWWDC07 up to Ô£øWWDC13 in SF and it was far from the church of rich folks when I compare it to other big corporate events. But hey, my first Mac was an SE/30, I have an IT background and no longer wear a jacket with a tie (and my AAPL stocks splitted 18 times)!/n<neu> AAPL going to hit 130 and then have some resistance. Longer term I'm looking for 160/n<pos> WOW $AAPL.  I have been swinging since 116.  Been selling covered calls.  I guess I will have to roll out more LOL./n<pos> What a day, Dayummm! Blood bath!

$AAPL also isn‚Äôt investing in growth. TC under WB influence is only interested in buyback.

But illegal for the Fed to actually own shares itself. Not advocating that happen, just to throwing out the LOL.

SMH... So insulting it‚Äôs laughable./n<neu> @elonmusk @michael_saylor if its so great, why are you all convincing elon to buy it, instead of buying more yourself ? 

If Apple was amazing, I would buy it all cheap before convincing Elon to buy 100B worth....

$TSLA/n<neu> I am guessing that an advance in battery tech is a) a primary reason why $AAPL revived the car project and b) why we‚Äôre hearing about it now, with solid-state batteries suddenly on investors‚Äô minds./n<neg> I‚Äôve never questioned $AAPL until recently.

And they just pulled out the ultimate trump card when they needed it most.  The only thing more fucked that the USA are equity bears...for a while./n<pos> I'll believe the $AAPL car is going to happen when they show an Apple car.

I do think some OEMs would like to be able to brand some of their EVs with Apple ties though.

(the bit that isn't in $TSLA üòâ)/n<neg> I don't believe $AAPL will manufacture cars.

Many people are selling $AAPL to buy $NIO and $TSLA.

The management knows it! So they release this information about the $AAPL car.

Do you expect shareholders to accept that $aapl develop its own electric car?

$nio started in 2014!/n<pos> Considering Apple still outsources manufacturing, I expect $AAPL to tackle the low hanging fruit and focus on design &amp; software (&amp; batteries for cost control and safety)

They will probably even use $TSLA as a supplier of electric motors, batteries &amp; maybe charging infrastructure/n<pos> I would love to see Apple and Tesla come together, create and manufacture an BEV.

Not to doubt a phone manufacturer getting into the EV game, but all this price action seems very reactionary to me. That 50 target still seems in reach for this week on $NIO./n<neg> I say a lot of sarcastic and dumb things on here, but this is not one of them:

The equities market was saved today by one stock: $AAPL.

One company. One news headline.

They never did.

I have been getting a lot of DMs lately and have to ask everyone to post in the threads, or go ahead and tweet at me and I‚Äôll be able to answer faster. Just answering all the personal DMs are getting hard and a lot of the questions over lap.

I'm good to bet that in 3 years time $AAPL will add more $ to its market cap than $FB will!

- $AAPL/n<neg> @jdlworkss @notoriousJD3 I get that. It's just a much more massive undertaking than people realize. Autonomy is one thing. Selling cars in a sustainable business model is entirely another. Also, $AAPL whole thing is about price premium, that will be a huge obstacle in industry where cost differentiates./n<neu> If you‚Äôre upset you‚Äôve missed today‚Äôs move on $aapl , follow me. 

Probably won‚Äôt miss the next one./n<neu> As a sellside analyst covering consumer goods and hardware I often had to come through patent filings and publications. $AAPL  not just a headline here folks look at the patents which are all PCT $TSLA/n<neu> I know a kid who dumped his life savings into $AAPL in 2016 at around $100 per share at cost. Realizing how smart he was for doing so, he decided to plow 80% of his capital into $TSLA on the 20th, citing index inclusion....../n<neu> I hope nobody is buying $aapl because they are going to produce an electric car.

You will also be buying all the other less performing businesses included in $aapl ...

$NIO $TSLA are way better if you want to get exposure from the electric vehicle revolution./n<neu> The ‚ÄúApple Car‚Äù

Buy Ford? I believe Apple‚Äôs biggest acquisition was Beats at $3B...maybe I‚Äôm wrong on that.

Macd weakening.. 15m death cross waiting to see if 30m/1h confirm death cross as well./n<neg> $AAPL manufacturing electric vehicles seems value-destructive for shareholders to me.

$TSLA/n<neu> Hello üëã Tr8ers,

I have been getting serval DM‚Äôs from people asking me to review various charts and get my in sight into what I see on the technical side 

Please submit your Symbol and any questions in thIs thread and I‚Äôll get to as many as possible today. 

$TSLA $MSFT $AAPL/n<neu> @Air_Matt True and the right thing to do. I let this one get to me so I had another call on $XPEV that I was up 100% on and I basically let that one die down to break even because I was still shook on letting the CHWY go too soon. Today's big winner was an $AAPL call that I sold./n<neu> I get that people are excited about $AAPL "possibly" entering the EV market, but to think that in 4 years, they will build a car with better capabilities, deliver more cars, and have better software than the future 2024 $TSLA, is very wishful thinking./n<neu> @smarter411 Sam earlier today I bought the AAPL 133 for 2.03 and sold half at 4.1

Do you think getting back in again now when they are back below 2 is worth it now/n<neg> $AMD  negative news about AAPL MSFT doing their own chip then contracting to manufacture... how many others DELL?    so today i was going to sell half anyway...i took half off 92.19   instead of waiting for the close below 20d ... below the line trading all day/n<neu> @data168 Takes conviction I assume this is the aapl effect/n<neu> @StrawHatStocks Right there with you

But, as soon as I saw your Apple Tweet last night I trimmed a small amount at $650 and put it into AAPL, because duh./n<pos> I am pretty sure everyone chasing these Apple "Lidar plays" have no idea that Apple $AAPL has been working on Lidar for years with their own 198 granted #patents. You learn something new every day./n<pos> $LAC so we feel AAPL news have it the boost? I just know once they have their own news this will have some nice steady gains/n<neu> @royblue11 @Tesla @Apple $AAPL $200 billion war-chest begs to differ. Remember, $TSLA depends on stock dilution to remain solvent. Btw battery technology, I guess you‚Äôre unfamiliar with phone battery technology and how it‚Äôs scaled for larger application. All noise/n<neu> @garyblack00 I don‚Äôt see $AAPL car as a real threat to $TSLA:

1. Rumours are not new
2. News could be driven by short seller
3. 2024 is late
4. Plan to outsource mfg
5. Lidar for their FSD- unscalable
6. Tesla will sell near cost&amp;make profits from software
7. EV adoption helps all EV makers/n<pos> @Spus @TripleDTrader @munster_gene I think $AAPL is the perfect company to dethrone $TSLA because $AAPL has an even stronger fan base and cult following than $TSLA does. It is a household name in these parts and worldwide./n<pos> @jimcramer @CNBC Jim your colleagues i feel are wrong in this . Apple Heads are so loyal because of a great brand and products . Ill take one in apple silver now , where do I send the deposit,  put me on the waiting list .Trust we have in AAPL/n<pos> One thing about $AAPL is that they know their tech when it comes to efficiency. iPhones were running 1gb of ram on their phones whilst android competitors were pushing 3,4gb+ and smashing them in benchmarks. They have the cash, I can see them making one hell of a dent in EV./n<neu> $SNOW is a tricky one. Caught me on the morning dip with an accidental fill. Made that loss back for even. Solid trades on $AAPL and $FSLY. Now it‚Äôs time to wait. Not seeing anything here. $SPX is choppy./n<neg> Popular opinion: $AAPL is overvalued, don't buy it.

If $AAPL with its battery tech partners with Toyota, it‚Äôll be game changer. I personally can‚Äôt wait to see iCar design $TSLA #AutonomousVehicles #ElectricVehicles/n<neu> @Djouce3 You bet. I often purchase LEAPs calls around 70 delta then sell just OTM shorter weekly calls to (hopefully) pay for the position a year or more out. Not quite same, but can be a relatively risk averse way to "chase" shares. $AAPL $PLTR and $MSFT right now for example./n<pos> Continuing to write puts and buy shares of $hyln as the $11.50 warrants should have been all done by now.  I am expecting this to be my biggest winner in 2021!   Maybe a 10 bagger (due to options). 
$lmnd $zm $tsla $aapl #ev $nkla $nio/n<pos> Given the $VLDR move on the back of $AAPL talk, I wonder what $QS would be worth to them $200 per share, $300 per share? If the tech is there, it is almost priceless for an incumbent EV manufacturer, and esp one with $AAPL's reputation/n<neu> 11/ Labor concerns: How will AAPL deal with potential unionization of its auto workers? This is something Tesla has not encountered yet, but I imagine they will at some point. Remains to be seen, but something to think about./n<pos> 10/ AV Strategy: Will AAPL go the way of Waymo (fleet based with city by city rollout) or more like $TSLA/ $GM (personal ownership with gradual rollout of autonomous functionality). Personally, I believe the Waymo approach is a less risky proposition. Will be interesting to see./n<neu> 9/ Point 8 is too big for one tweet. Happy to follow up with further thoughts there...many issues that I believe AAPL will be thinking through here./n<neg> @vincent13031925 I closed all my $AAPL yesterday! no interested on ICAR when I got S3XY/n<pos> Sold $aapl, $pltr, and $wkhs.

In that case, wouldn't $FSR be an acquisition target for the designs and $MGA agreement? (Disclaimer: I own AAPL and FSR)/n<pos> @garyblack00 Exactly.  I love Apple stuff, I made plenty on AAPL (now it's all in TSLA), but the idea of Apple being able to give Tesla serious competition is almost comical.

Bigger one is wave 3. I'm out since i only have 1 position and I dont want to chase wave 5./n<pos> $AAPL chart setup definitely looks bullish, new highs likely I suppose. But fair warning: its PE is now 40, and even a 7% move higher would be equivalent to adding the market cap of an $XOM. What is the upside? Even stable recurring revs don't get PEs of 50-60 once co is mature/n<neu> @GerberKawasaki I don‚Äôt see how $AAPL challenges $TSLA without the billions of recorded miles that $TSLA has. AI depends on it. $AAPL may lead the next batch and become #2, but I don‚Äôt see a $TSLA competitor here./n<neu> $aapl paid me today/n<pos> I love $AAPL/n<pos> $tsla @elonmusk AAPl Car is 3 years off, which is plenty of time for the Tesla team and Elon Musk to prepare to meet Apple‚Äôs car head on.I want an EV I can drive!

Stll a long way to fall from these very lofty levels. I continue to remain short, most through option writes. #EV Competition which is already strong will begin to really kill Tesla in 2021. $AAPL also on its way. 

$TSLA $TSLAQ/n<neg> @passthebeano @aapl screenshots? i'm blocked/n<neu> Already had put some $AAPL into let it ride I went from 1/4 of the original position to 1/2 into let it rides.  I still have some trade shares./n<pos> Since Summer, I tweeted almost daily about investing in $AAPL.

$AAPL to double from 130  (I am long from 128  after the news)
$TSLA to halve from 650 (I was short with avg entry at 650 even before the news)

Don't @ me now. Will review in six months/n<pos> As a prudent value investor, I'm going to pass on $AAPL here and wait for Facebook's electric vehicle.  

Dashboard ad revenue will be a huge competitive advantage for the FaceCar. $FB/n<pos> @BrownTexasNinja I agree.  Fisher had MAJOR battery issues with the Karma.  That was by far the best looking sedan for the money.  The Ocean is very promising.  AAPL has plenty of cash on hand to buy FSR.

You really think $AAPL consumers gonna buy a machine and put their ipad on it. I mean.../n<neu> $AAPL is going to make electric cars.

Good luck traders, if anyone has questions about any symbol feel free to ask and I will let you know what I think from the technicals./n<pos> @TradeTimeline @SystematicVoL Personally, I think they all do well through the 1H of next year. I'm long $IWM as well as individual components in $QQQ like $AAPL $MSFT and $AMZN. Yields up at some point will eat into the valuations of big tech, but we're not there yet./n<neg> I can‚Äôt imagine how apple would deal with infrastructure to support vehicles.  So they will outsource everything but design and tech. Of course this will never work in scale.  End of story. $aapl $tsla #EV/n<neu> Yesterday $AAPL bottomed around $124, today she going to open at $131. 

I am where the money resides./n<neu> I should‚Äôve went in on AAPL more/n<neu> $AAPL all targets met.

It‚Äôs like once Apple user never go back to any other. And that seems to be the perception as well./n<neg> @garyblack00 If $RIMM was down at close yesterday because of $AAPL phone rumor, RIMM is due for a bounce. I strongly disagree with Jonas that $AAPL represents formidable phone competition. The AAPL brand, while beloved, doesn‚Äôt naturally extend to phones, and 2007 is too late to compete./n<pos> @t24_north @77hz_ @SawyerMerritt I am too . Like I said before I have a lot of $APPL &amp; own it at ave strike of $20 split adjusted . Would Love Apple to continue to kick ass but I just didn‚Äôt buy it as a EV company bro . Go $AAPL &amp; Go $TSLA !!!/n<pos> @squawksquare $AAPL has made a killing on AirPods too. Since the iPhone, I would say the AirPods have been the most game changing tech to everyone buys. 

Tesla is gonna do the same with solar and power wall eventually. You can witness the growth on their quarterly financials./n<neg> @garyblack00 Are we talking about the same Jonas who had a target between 10$ and 391$ and still missed it?! Try missing a giant target in a corridor with a bazooka... I can‚Äôt believe some people still take him seriously. If $AAPL had a JV with VW then that might work, otherwise ü§î/n<pos> $TSLA I could see Elon trolling $AAPL and making a cellphone in 2024 since they are making a car. Remember this tweet.

Tesla makes software improvements to make your old products faster.  $TSLA

Why would you buy an apple car that would just get slower as it ages?  Pass./n<neg> @StephensNick86 @squawksquare Finally someone gets it.  Amazing how many people got upset after I posted $TSLA levels of support and even brought up what @munster_gene said about $AAPL long term as a viable competitor./n<pos> @DereckCoatney $TSLA is far from dead.  $AAPL just upped the anti for 2024, IF their EV is competitive with @Tesla's.  That's at this point a big "IF"!  So I am still long on @TSLA and $AAPL but for different reasons for each.  @Apple @tim_cook @Teslaconomics @elonmusk/n<pos> $AAPL first time seeing  apple stock up 3% ever since I bot stock in September/n<pos> @JBoyd_TDA Good morning $AAPL apple üçè and I like even if  Apple üçé/n<pos> $aapl going to open at 132. I‚Äôd suggest to sell some calls and free ride the rest. Cheers. Du it./n<neu> $AAPL I don‚Äôt think the car plans involve Apple becoming a vehicle manufacturer./n<neu> so Powell justifies stocks based on the "risk-free rate" thesis.  I will say the $tnx now give $aapl a run for the money with a yield higher than $AAPL dividend yield which was in reverse until this year.  Now:  .93 % on $TNX vs .64 % on $aapl dividend so expansion now on 40 PE./n<neu> @MarkTMeredith I think that means $AAPL isn‚Äôt a car company mate!/n<neg> @squawksquare @PeshRealty I'm not upset about you tweeting anything pro-or-con with regards to $TSLA.

You often just call out FUD for what it is.  And this, certainly looks like FUD to me.  And this more seems a negative to $AAPL for being desperate, than a challenge to $TSLA.  I think this helps $TSLA./n<pos> Hmmm, not so sure on that.  I love my Model Y Performance but it be interesting to see what $AAPL can do with their design and huge cash reserves.  @munster_gene on CBNC said long term the only other viable competitor is $AAPL/n<neu> Who do you think is in a better position $AAPL or $TSLA ?  I will go with $AAPL./n<pos> @its_Justintime @chubbc89 Awesome! Thanks for your reply. I wish I were not risk averse. This year I bought few $AAPL options &amp; EFT and have realized gains of $222.13. Mostly from $TNA.  It' great you're 27 and have that much money invested already. I wish I would have known that at your age./n<neu> @John10510 @AlexisD47265049 @squawksquare That said I'm obviously biased for being long $TSLA and not holding any $AAPL stock, so it's not like I'm the expert here./n<pos> Good morning #Twitterfam! 

Here's what i am looking today:

$SQ / $PYPL / $NIO / $LI / $XPEV / $AAPL / $TSLA / $SNDL/n<neu> @munster_gene I disagree. Think about Audi and Porsche. A lot is coming, even if I am highly skeptical of those companies, German engineering is not dead yet. $AAPL and $TSLA may be the sole leaders in the US but not on a global scale. $TSLA is my bet on one OS for every car comparable to MSFT/n<neg> 5 of 6 stocks i am tracking had the same chart pattern....i passed on $AAPL premkt...not beta enough/n<pos> Market looking green and healthy. Cashing out on my $AAPL contract today and hoping it pulls back so I can purchases 2022 and 2023 contracts./n<pos> @stocks_eagle @Benzinga I day traded $AAPL for years. It doesn't move enough any more to make it worth day trading. Made way more trading $TSLA but did make some good coin trading Apple for a while./n<pos> To be honest, there are only a few companies that can make serious EV cars. And year, $AAPL and $GOOD are two of them. Shit is about to get real $TSLA. But I believe in @elonmusk and I think that @Tesla (et al.) has the potential to become the most valuable company in the World./n<neu> @squawksquare @Benzinga @squawksquare i think you will start trading $AAPL soon/n<pos> @garyblack00 My beloved brand aapl, even if it make into production, it will probably cost $300k imo. They just make the most expensive chips, design a impractical garage show (futuristic) car. Sorry, I love Apple but totally not their forte.. n more likely a news to bash tsla on 1st s&amp;p day/n<neu> @BudFoxNQ20K Thats not what I'm saying. Better way to say it. Better to buy $AAPL now at a percentage then not vs hold $ROKU at this percentage/n<pos> $AAPL has been talking about cars for years. It is quite possible they looked at $TLSA PER of a bazillion and said... "let's have some of that". At some point they will approach saturation of connected devices and need a pivot. If the iCar is due 2024, that makes good timing/n<pos> I got lucky with $PLTR but missed the $AAPL entry point. Tesla competitor news likely gave it a boost/n<neu> @garyblack00 2024.  In 3 years.  Minimum.  Where was Tesla in 2017 in terms of products, tech, etc...?  I know, AAPL got tons of money at the bank.  But money cannot buy everything... (fortunately ;-))/n<pos> You know what the craziest thing is tho?

$aapl tv is 1000x better than a $roku or any other streaming device - don‚Äôt argue with me Becuase your wrong. 

But $aapl never pushes it - if they do - kiss your $roku $fubo and whatever else goodbye/n<neu> $AAPL not a car builder.  They would probably use either $NIO, $LI, or $XPEV to build them.  Those are all a buy.  I am long them @stoolpresidente/n<neg> @squawksquare @Benzinga It has so little  sense as the article 

‚Äú$AAPL could emerge as $BA and Airbus First True Competition‚Äù 

Would ya believe in that as well????

I wonder who is going to be an idiot coming out with such article?/n<neg> The report about Apple Car form Reuters sounds fishy to me, at least at the portion on  ‚Äúnext level break through LFP battery‚Äù, come on LFP is a mature technology! $AAPL/n<neu> $TSLA Has not completed the self driving  EV vehicle. $AAPL will have to complete it for them.   $AAPL products are proven and reliable.   I‚Äôve been waiting for this announcement for years from $AAPL./n<neg> It is probably a lack of imagination on my part but I have a hard time believing this $AAPL car rumor./n<pos> Wow Jim i think $AAPL goes to 140 today like it or not ü§£ @jimcramer üöÄüöÄ‚úåüöÄ‚úå‚úå‚úå‚úå/n<neg> @Cole00708909 @teslaownerssv @Tesla @elonmusk I suspect the big loser from AAPL joining the party won't be Tesla, it'll be the legacy OEMs./n<neu> Who‚Äôll gift me $NIO or #AAPL stocks for Christmas? ü•∫/n<neu> $AAPL any dip to 131 area I will load heavy for a smooth cruise to 134. Doubtful we get it though/n<pos> $AAPL making a EV car. Great for my #options trade and the underlying  but my not so sure this makes sense. As innovators, they could make all sorts of 5G type gadgets for home and business use. 

Agree or not?/n<neu> @firstgenwealth Did I ü§ëüó£Ô∏èü•∞ $AMZN $BABA $BLI $SHOP $AAPL $ADBE $NVDA $XLNX just to name a few...

Ha....../n<neu> @squawksquare @Benzinga I switched to $aapl on Friday and made a nice chunk of cash. Not sure when to sell and if this will be the new Tesla to keep buying the dips./n<pos> $pltr and $aapl moving for me thank you @OptionsFuru/n<neg> With $AAPL entering the car market, and since so many feel $TSLA is a tech co. more so than a car company,  When the hell is @elonmusk going to release a mobile phone? Tequila,  shorts,  flame throwers..... why not/n<pos> Although markets closed slightly lower yesterday, it was an incredible reversal from futures prices earlier that night. Makes me more bullish into year end. Long: AAPL AMD MAR DAL NNDM FSLY NEM XLE. SHORT: XLU GLD INCY./n<neu> LMND

No need for me to play anything crazy this month, just catch the dips/n<neu> @MannyMagoo Man, i never thought of that! 

Great call.

AAPL should buy NIO and they have the cash sitting there. 

I was thinking we might see a short term AAPL play on news but guess see how it plays out today./n<pos> @ItsKimJava I wish $aapl luck. They have great design skills and offshore manufacturing capabilities. Yet they and the rest of the emerging EV industry are years behind Tesla. If they succeed they will hasten the decline of ICE and expand the overall market, but not adversely affect $tsla./n<neu> @garyblack00 $AAPL has been positioning itself as a lifestyle brand and close integration of their products brings great traction. I don‚Äôt believe it will make sense for them to compete directly, some important strategic decisions need to be made soon/n<neg> @jimcramer Dear Chillman - why is every company trying to do EVs now?  Really $AAPL now into it also?  I love the brand and own the ticker but I just dont see it!!/n<neg> @BWUIC I'm not impressed by #AAPL tho. All this secrecy over EV and self-driving project is up in the air. They've "been working on it" since 2018, yet, no significant results have been presented so far. And during the last event they claimed to concentrate more on the service sector./n<neu> what's interesting is... there is a stigma and im sure millennials don't like taking their cars for service but imagine driving up to a Genius Garage after the Genius Bar... honestly i'd 100% trust $aapl. they say fix this, i'll fix it. not sure about traditional brands tho.üôèüòá/n<neu> Looks like I‚Äôm holding #AAPL till 2024üòÇüòÖ/n<neu> would be very surprised if @elonmusk $aapl hasn't been thinking about this for multi-years or since inception... don't doubt elon, his plan is not "i hope $aapl doesn't build it", there will likely be more and something ordinary don't see./n<neu> @subach I don‚Äôt think $AAPL getting into the car manufacturing biz is a great idea.  But it would be really funny if they disrupted $TSLA in the same way they did Blackberry./n<neu> @wyv_123 I only saw $AAPL, but what is the link to $VW?/n<neu> it's just an announcement , why is everyone freaking out .. ok i'll announce to create a EV that will fly.. what's the fuss, it's merely an announcement, nothing serious relax $TSLA $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL mentioned that they‚Äôd be working with an EV company to produce their variant. It‚Äôll be interesting to see which one the market starts pricing that in for. I‚Äôm gonna go with all of them, then we get one hell of a pop when AAPL actually announces a partnership./n<pos> Some tickers I like today $SUNW, $IDEX, and $AAPL ‚Äî will update if I take a position - don‚Äôt go run and buy a bunch./n<neu> Should I change my biggest positions of $ROKU &amp; $SQ with $AAPL &amp; $SHOP?/n<neu> @JeromePowellet1 @chief_huskie @elonmusk If It have a US account I'll go long in puts...otm..provably the more far un time the more otm...and see what happens...fue me this isn't an amzn kind if case ..looks more like Enron...

Aapl saying they'll making icars...then another like msft and that's it..the end if the dream/n<pos> @Quarry_Rock, so AAPL is making self driving cars with ‚Äònext level‚Äô batteries. This made me laugh and think of you since I know you‚Äôre such an advocate for apple‚Äôs battery life üòÜ/n<pos> $AAPL I am making more than 20% a month trading stocks,is that good?/n<neg> $aapl $tsla $li $xpev $nio

If $AAPL gets into cars, do you guys think that $MSFT will too in the future?

$ROKU $ETSY have gone nuts recently... I'm thinking about selling premium soon. I don't wanna get clapped tho/n<neu> Nightly Watchlist (For 12/22/2020)

Lots more may be in play if these vaccines are quick and effective!/n<neu> @LeTSLAunch_ I hold both... More $TSLA than $AAPL.  Up until last week I was considering trimming Apple to purchase more Tesla on the post inclusion dip.

Wait until a technology is mature then release a fully-formed version that wins out? I believe in TSLA but I‚Äôm not discounting AAPL here if they choose to compete. Better competition to TSLA than most legacy carmakers IMO./n<neg> Took $AAPL, $SNAP, $AMD off the table on Friday. $AAPL -20% L, $SNAP -50% L on adjusted strike calls, $AMD killer. Eating these and $AAPL move today making me kick myself!/n<neu> Don‚Äôt know how you can‚Äôt continue to love $AAPL. I was wrong in April but technicals look poised/n<pos> $AAPL i car fomo looking good./n<neu> $AAPL turning me into a long term holder.  Maybe @jimcramer is right.  ‚Äúown it, don‚Äôt trade it‚Äù/n<neu> $aapl already own Feb calls. Plan today pickup a further expiry call and get rid of my Feb calls on the next strong green day. Picked up March on the dip when apple was -$6 down today. Apple comes out with ev and rockets 
Now I can't get rid of Feb calls lol mo money mo problems/n<neu> @Ijeodum Lol, I agree AAPL isn't so much to count on. I actually hinted you about $NNOMF 2 weeks ago but maybe it got buried in the chat. It was around $2.40 then. But you really can't go wrong that much with any of those battery makers. If AAPL buys A, then expect sympathy play on B./n<neg> @HeirJaybee Yeahhhh $QS üî•üî•üî•.  Look at you with the gems! First time hearing of $NNOMF. I do agree the battery deal will have to happen before, if not for anything to build momentum, but then AAPL doesn‚Äôt have a good reputation with batteries (phones) üòÇüòÇ tho, so I don‚Äôt know./n<pos> @heydave7 Anything is possible, Dave! 

Gene Munster mentioned in his analysis today of $AAPL‚Äôs anouncement; ‚ÄúAs talk of Apple Car gains momentum, I‚Äôm reminded of a valuable lesson I learned the hard way: just because Apple is working on a product doesn‚Äôt mean it will see the light of day‚Äù/n<pos> @NorthmanTrader Yup. The $AAPL slice looks very similar to mine. I buy some every paycheck./n<pos> With their announcement on producing EVs, I‚Äôd expect $AAPL to be a good long term investment. Slow and steady but almost guaranteed growth throughout the next 5+ years. Will it be like $TSLA, I don‚Äôt think so but it will definitely be a safe investment. 

#SPX #NYSE #NASDAQ/n<pos> But I do think $AAPL can be $250 in 5 years with this iCar./n<pos> i loaded the boat with $aapl today, insane position size/n<pos> $nio is fine as people will realize it‚Äôs another 4 years for $aapl to come to the market. The pie is huge anyway. And you know what.  I went thru it with $roku which beat $aapl $amzn and $googl altogether. Today marks 500%  for my $roku position./n<neg> Today is a day that you‚Äôd feel bad if none of your stocks went up 10%. Well time to take a deep breath and focus on what you do well. Tmw will see if $aapl can pull some crazy stunts./n<neu> @eddiemac3356 I actually think &lt;$90bn equity ($60) for $GM isn‚Äôt a terrible deal for $AAPL./n<neu> Rumors of an $AAPL car only add to what I expect will be a fundamental change in the Tesla narrative over then next 6-9 months.  The dual problems of 1) increased competition and; 2) safety/quality concerns continue to make $TSLA $TSLAQ a compelling short./n<pos> Couple days ago I read @logical_el tweet about ppl having the newest iPhone but no $aapl stock and that inspired me this morning to buy in/n<neu> @jimcramer If you are in big data tech &amp; AI as I am, you will understand why a company like PLTR is very much in this pubescent stage of data technology. Much more to algorithms  when datasets are well formed and have superior models. I‚Äôm sure AAPL was a hit when Jobs built Next machines./n<pos> @BlockChain187 @GrAyseKang1 @henrikfisker I like to see an AAPL car w/ all its best art of design, UX, &amp; h/w, s/w, app, &amp; content ecosystem integrated./n<pos> Silver on the bid: night #2

Somebody please tell r/wsb that $SLV is the $AAPL of precious metals. I tripled my position in it last week and would appreciate some of their yolo juice./n<neu> Some of the long term options that I got in during this mornings pull back:

$AAPL

Reach out to me if you are interested in my target prices for the underlying ticker.

Make sure to have a plan tomorrow morning./n<neu> @moose_ali I know what you mean but no one thought that $AAPL will be making its own chips now. $INTC is done./n<pos> @inoviolt Let‚Äôs see. I bet AAPL will build a car w/ the best design &amp; UX, plus their own semiconductors &amp; a great ecosystem for h/w, s/w, apps. &amp; then have everything integrated for music, movie, TV, telehealth, photo, etc. just thing over it is fun. It doesn‚Äôt need to be the best tech./n<neu> @CrumbsCracker @SawyerMerritt Absolutely. You need to Trade in / upgrade your Apple Car every 2 years for new Apple Car Model or the Battery Dies . That is why I bought $AAPL in the first place . I am one of those fools that bought a new IPhone every 2 years üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ/n<neu> @GrAyseKang1 @LuoshengPeng @henrikfisker Everyone makes it seem that with $AAPL news about EV today, that they just started working on this recently. Project Titan has been there officially since 2014 and probably earlier. That‚Äôs 6 yrs. They‚Äôve been driving in SF using Lexus for autonomous driving for 3+ years./n<neu> Can $TSLA still be the $AAPL of electric vehicles if Apple makes EVs.../n<neu> @SawyerMerritt üòÇ üòÇ üòÇFull disclosure I still have quite a bit of $AAPL &amp; I agree Apple has no real shot at Tesla but I actually think they will beat Ford,Mercedes,Toyota &amp; Hyundai at the EV game . They may buy Ford &amp; GM just for their factories for $.10 on the $  and gut them for production/n<neu> @swan1427 I'm with you on QS and Aapl./n<pos> @garyblack00 Productivity? Maybe in some narrow segments. But, $MSFT still dominates by far. I think $AAPL is more a lifestyle brand. I have no doubt they will redefine the car and if it's good, people will buy it. But, this is a nothing announcement so far./n<pos> @LuoshengPeng I like $AAPL and long the LEAPS.  Historically , when a stock does a split, regardless of 2/1, 3/1, or 4/1, within 18 months the stock is back to the value pre split.  $AAPL is definitely an innovative company./n<pos> @JonahLupton @BSchulz33868165 So much $AAPL though, I am a happy shareholder/n<neu> @ParikPatelCFA Now that $AAPL is making EVs, can you concur their price target is now 1,200x revenue?  According to Google, annual revenue is estimated to be $274.5 billion. I multiplied that by 1,200 to get a market cap of $329.4 Trillion for the newest EV maker on the market/n<pos> You guys also think same as me ? $FSR and Apple?? Sooo real $AAPL/n<neu> Apple $AAPL &amp; Amazon $AMZN are under government scrutiny right now, and Disney $DIS doesn‚Äôt need that. I think Netflix $NFLX, Comcast (Universal) $CMCSA, and AT&amp;T $T (WarnerMedia) get into a bidding war. 

P.S. Comcast already owns a sizable stake: 20%/n<pos> @CanIBeRell @raptors17u @MJM_35 Yes, I‚Äôll sell these contract and get others with a 2021 exp. date! I wish $AAPL and $FSR would team upüòÇüòÇ. I‚Äôm holding FSR for a Tesla like move. Tesla 5 years ago was very cheapüëÄ/n<pos> @NStocks96 Im sitting these dope ass $AAPL calls Ready to cash in so I can put a down payment on an IPhone inspired electrical vehicle. üöô/n<neg> @AwesomeFinance1 Lol you kidding right?  If there was one company that can bring down $TSLA, it‚Äôs $AAPL - in terms of sheer resources, logistic infrastructure, brand recognition, and fuck you money just laying around. 

And that‚Äôs why $TSLA fanbois are scared.  I‚Äôm here for the popcorn./n<neg> I knew I should‚Äôve bought a fucking call on AAPL today ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ughhh/n<pos> @OphirGottlieb Aapl up$60Billion in mkt cap on this already. Makes sense./n<neg> @garyblack00 and also @garyblack00  I seriously doubt about their ($AAPL) innovation in recent years.After Iphone they have not done any innovation at all means at all/n<neu> @OphirGottlieb By the way.  Years back in the early days of cml pro, you use to tweet out reports on $AAPL as a way of advertising Cml pro.  That is how I originally subscribed for $10 / month after reading your bullish outlook on $AAPL/n<pos> @garyblack00 I‚Äôm as bullish on Tesla as it gets given 80% of what I have is Tesla... but $AAPL is a the only serious competition here. They have been working on this for a while. A decade at least. Also these rumors are strategic leak by Apple itself./n<neu> @MaskedContango No doubt. Agree with you. All I‚Äôm saying is FAANMG has some of the best cash flow on the street, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre going to be safe stocks to own the rest of the decade. Trade $AAPL, don‚Äôt own it./n<pos> $aapl has 12% phone market share in China so I think $NIO will be safe from #icar domination there./n<neu> @MadMraket I am long $AAPL my forever holding./n<neg> Careful people a aspl car destroys margins.   iPhone margins over 60%. A car at most is 25%.  Destroys margins.   I‚Äôm confused. Who said Aapl want to do a car.  Not Tim Cook ?     Regardless Aapl to 150 comes./n<pos> @RyTrader4 @FT_Trades Brother if AAPL makes an EV car. The product will be quality. Not like TSLA recalls. I own TSLA and everyone loves AAPL for a reason. They have a huge following./n<pos> I would like to go back in time and triple my size in $AAPL and $PTON. Kthx/n<pos> @BrownTexasNinja Yeah, I noticed that as well.  $AAPL has been good to me lately!/n<neu> Idk how I knew $AAPL would be produce cars but I always knew.. buying call tomorrow üöÄ/n<pos> @GerberKawasaki I‚Äôm so excited about $aapl making cars and breakthrough battery tech! That means my iPhone will last more than 6 hours in 2024, my cell reception will definitely improve exponentially in 2024 since apple cars will be interconnected so apple has to improve cell reception. Right??/n<neu> @DowneastCapital @NuttAPriest @hiltonholloway I get what you‚Äôre saying, but AAPL reinvented the smartphone segment when rolling out their new product. iOS wasn‚Äôt put on a Palm. You can‚Äôt buy their OS and install it on a PC. Apple wants full control over the final product,even if Foxconn or VW are the ones who manufacture it./n<neu> @DowneastCapital @NuttAPriest @hiltonholloway My point is that AAPL isn‚Äôt big on non-differentiated products, and needs to design the car. If the body looks like a slightly reskinned VW, that‚Äôs not their style. If the interior does, ... that‚Äôs not their style. They COULD just do infotainment, but I wouldn‚Äôt bet on it./n<neu> @vaporcharts @vincent13031925 I wouldn‚Äôt discount Apple. With $193 Billion cash they have the power to turn the course of EV market. Now the question is if you are inverted both in AAPL &amp; TSLA, what‚Äôs the long play?/n<neg> @garyblack00 Same camp! I agree on the brand comments and calendar to far out! $TSLA‚Äôs gap on innovation will continue to create a larger gap by 2024! Similar to $QS, until $AAPL can show mass production with sales, not orders, I will not be convinced! üôÉ/n<pos> @MrprezTrades Thankfully I had a tight stop on it. Seeing AAPL where it‚Äôs at AH makes it all the more comical. üòÇ/n<pos> I love how they let all of those OTM calls expire worthless last week then ripped $AAPL #AAPL today... #Classic/n<neg> @ChartingOptions Was that on the EV news? No way to have known that dude, you traded your trade. I must have bought and sold $AAPL about 4 times this year. It's dead trading for me. Put that $AAPL money in $MARA or $ZI or something./n<pos> @fiducia_invest @daniel_toloko I will always love $AAPL./n<neu> @smartertrader As far as conspiracies go... I like the one where $aapl will use $QS/n<neg> Bought the AAPL 129C today and when I went to set my stop, I accidentally sold it.. funniest mistake I‚Äôve made. Wasn‚Äôt even mad üòÇ/n<neg> @chaseantoniox $tsla is in big trouble. I read recently that $aapl is the only company that could ruin Tesla‚Äôs ride.  This is gonna be interesting/n<pos> It would be very interesting if $AAPL goes into the auto industry. However, it was a long time ago since Apple disrupted an industry; it hasn't really happened since Steve died.

If Apple collaborates with old OEM I expect the iCar will be about as exciting as the Motorola ROKR./n<neg> @MasterPandaWu aapl has been bothering me too....it needs to complete.../n<neu> Portfolio update. Had a bunch in cash so I bought the dip -
Bought: $AAPL, $COUP, $DDOG, $DIS, $JNPR, $OKTA, $PINS, $RDFN, $SQM, $T (more), $UPS, $XLF
Sold: $AAPL (AH), $JNJ, $PLTR (AH)
Still holding: $AAPL, $ARKF, $ARKG, $ARKK, $DKNG, $ESPO, $GS, $GWRE, $PLTR, $V, $XLY/n<neg> @garyblack00 $AAPL is going to suffer a research and development costs of lunching car design and production. It will kill them financially. Gosh. They do not know what they are talking about.
I hope just press. 
If AAPL management then they are insane. Bad news for AAPL./n<neg> I wasn‚Äôt bearish at all today but the last few hours wasn‚Äôt impressive.  Too much $AAPL push. Won‚Äôt be surprised if we open lower/n<neu> @NuttAPriest @DowneastCapital @hiltonholloway That‚Äôs my thought. IF ANYTHING, and I‚Äôm not convinced this makes it to production, AAPL will design a car and let someone else build it. (Like their other products.) That‚Äôs Fisker‚Äôs plan, but AAPL has more name recognition, even inside the Automotive Design world./n<neu> I had $AAPl 130 Weekly at .80 bought it on Friday, sold it at .60 in the morning when it was dipping. The Option went to .20 at the lowest, will open at $1.80-2 tomorrow. 
The point is, you can't catch them all, you will make mistakes; just don't dwell, Learn and move on./n<neu> @TrueBubbleHead I miss this entry, was on my radar but went to the gym and boom ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è...still was green with a 2 entry‚Äôs $PLTR n $ AAPL/n<pos> @vincent13031925 Aapl might be good when their AR/VR glasses come out.   I bet AR/VR will be next big thing./n<neu> Can I PLEASE get these gap ups tonight?
$QS -$115
$FEYE - $23

THANK YOU/n<neu> I‚Äôm finally up in my aapl stonks üò≠/n<pos> @vincent13031925 I recommend having both shares of $AAPL and $TSLA. Both have a great future!/n<pos> 2/ $AAPL ‚Äòs brand is about individual productivity. Apple works on phones, tablets, computers, accessories. But can Apple work on self driving cars, against $TSLA $AMZN or $GOOG? To me it‚Äôs a huge stretch. And 2024 is too late: TSLA self driving cars will be out long before that./n<pos> @Goose2217 üòÇüòÇüòÇ even if accurate,  #applefanatics like me would still buy it!  IDGAF  #bullish  $AAPL/n<neu> Anyone else think $AAPL should probably just buy $F or $GM otherwise I'll take the the over on them having a production ready vehicle in basically 2-3 years./n<neg> Tim Cook is a Klingon. 
Convince me otherwise.

But you can‚Äôt change the goal post for Tesla and Apple. Tesla doesn‚Äôt make profit selling cars but it‚Äôs valuation is because of possibilities. Apple already has enough cash to put 10 factories up in 6 months. They don‚Äôt need to make profit like Tesla. $TSLA $AAPL/n<neu> @franklesK @SawyerMerritt I do not worry about $TSLA I worry about $AAPL.

And if you believe in the mission and the company- you shouldn't be bothered by this - this is a good thing. 

What I would love to see is $AAPL investing with $TSLA with th charging network ... omg./n<neu> @MadMraket I‚Äôm actually planning a short term pair trade long $AAPL and short $TSLA going into Jan 2021/n<neu> How come Apple $AAPL never got into the big screen TV market? , I mean it‚Äôs right up their alley ü§î thoughts anyone?/n<pos> @OphirGottlieb Sounds bullish to me $AAPL/n<neu> @iampatelrp I had opened them last week and was just looking to make it a bit more juicy. I agree, not much above AAPL./n<neu> @stoxline Guess I was right about $aapl üôÇ/n<pos> Hey Who all are excited about Apple car news rumour.

Heard they‚Äôll make the 4th Lug Nut of the Rear Right tire rim for the 2024 AAPL car launch./n<pos> @imran_amjad Nice one! I got $TSLA, $SQ, $AAPL and $PLTR out of those ones. 

Since cybersecurity is one of your key holdings, what‚Äôs your take on Blackberry $BB ?/n<pos> 2/ My second comment is about Apple. For reference, the original Macintosh was introduced in January 1984 and I had one on my desk the following month. I have been following the company for a long time.
$AAPL/n<neu> @jus10castelli $aapl for me./n<neg> @ParikPatelCFA I agree. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt invest in crap companies like $AAPL and $MSFT/n<pos> @ParikPatelCFA Thank goodness I didn‚Äôt load up on aapl at .07. Bullet dodged./n<pos> @bgtaylo yes. Pretty crowed market. This is why I only picked $AAPL and $TSLA in vehicle and front runners like $SBE in charging and $LAZR $VLDR $CRGO in LiDAR./n<neu> I wonder if $AAPL will offer autonomous driving tech similar to $TSLA (but perhaps with not quite as many bells and whistles)... but not charge $10,000 for it. The first #AppleCar will probably not be cheap but if the EV tax credit is still around, it may be cost-competitive./n<pos> @SawyerMerritt is it weird I like $AAPL trying to develop an EV car to rival $TSLA? I think it only gets @elonmusk competitive juices flowing even more. GAME ON!/n<neu> @10xMOIC A lot of the same.

Quality company, but not for me at this time/n<neg> @OphirGottlieb My "I think" on $AAPL cars helps no one. Fact is to get to production, scale, and market will require a big cash burn. (SH value?)

I am not selling any single $NIO/n<neg> $aapl fck, I received a call!

Perhaps, it is T_im?,

I am not selling my $NIO shares. I will not pick up the phone./n<neu> If $AAPL making cars and tim won‚Äôt talk to elon.... then $FSR should be making waves? No?...... i‚Äôm buying equities, go talk about with your mama./n<pos> @BSchulz33868165 I feel like QQQ is making a VCP pattern and AMZN and AAPL will both breakout at the same time bringing the whole market with it/n<neu> @SpacBobby Are you seeing $AAPL + $FSR = iMotion... Cramer was saying something in this regard few days ago.  I would like to know your thoughts/n<neu> @flyinghellfish8 2021 I want to get to 100 $AAPL and start doing options, keep building my Telus and ETFs.  See what else I can do/n<neu> @ShannonSaccocia Imagine AAPL working with manufacturers to integrate with Apple Fitness+. That can crush PTON.  I would buy Calls for short term but if Apple announces in WWDC or a press announcement, I would be either shorting the stock or buying Puts./n<pos> @jus10castelli If I could add one I‚Äôd say $DIS.  Of this list I‚Äôd say the strongest brand is $AAPL but the most loyal is $TSLA/n<neu> Apple's Entrance Into EVs Creates "A New Tesla Bear Case", Morgan Stanley Warns

- Hmmm.

- creating two bear cases for $TSLA &amp; $AAPL üçª
- you never know
- haha   fun?  üòâ/n<neu> @LynAldenContact I‚Äôve been long aapl since 2013 on the same thesis./n<pos> @LynAldenContact What I find fascinating about aapl is it‚Äôs a hardware company with an aspirational brand, a software company with platform/marketplace attributes, a VC firm, and a financial machine that can short the dollar while being cash neutral (optionality), and pivot from there as needed./n<neu> Reading some wall street analysts speculate Apple won‚Äôt release a car but license a CarOS+AV tech to automakers. Apparently they haven‚Äôt followed Apple very long. It‚Äôs an AppleCar or bust. Nothing else would move the needle at this point ($2.2T).

I‚Äôm long $AAPL./n<neu> The Hamptons kids went back for thirds with $AAPL Calls. I guess an üçé a day keeps the üêª away?

12/31 $138 - 50,000 x $0.72 (avg price) = $3.6M/n<neu> @MatsoYuriy AAPL, I didn't write apple duh/n<neu> I doubt the checks will be for $2000, but double the 6 to $1200 and you‚Äôll see that $$$ flow straight to $AAPL just like the last checks./n<pos> @skilledinvest @CathieDWood @tim_cook @elonmusk Exactly, Why would Tim cook take on Elon at that point in time, when Elon was a wild man on twitter and having production issues, Apple makes money fist over fist, why disrupt that.  Elon is full of promises, Apple just delivers! 
Long both... $TSLA , $AAPL/n<pos> I think $FSR can have a huge squeeze here, maybe even pulls a $xl move or better. @jimcramer saying they have potential to partner with $aapl is just huge, @fisker can really take off, it‚Äôs probably one of the best ev companies outside to compete with $tsla/n<neu> Sold the 75 1/15c $MGA calls I had. Too big of a quick gain from yesterday to not take the money. Added a 2/19 95 call. Still like company. Still think any stupid $AAPL rumor moons it./n<neu> @Cole00708909 @CathieDWood @tim_cook @elonmusk I don't have an $AAPL position.  I saw what growth looks like as Apple stock changed throughout it's life.

$TSLA's growth is just starting, apple's has slowed./n<neg> @GerberKawasaki Man, I can sense the frustration when she talk abt $AAPL battery and you can't wait to jump right in and cut her off..  üòÖ/n<pos> @LordPente @CathieDWood @tim_cook @elonmusk I wouldn‚Äôt exit $aapl as it still has streaming revenues from a gigantic customer base. Plus the likely push up of price from the car rumor will draw in buyers. Holding it would be a wise choice, but definitely put new money into $tsla though/n<neu> @Nyahbinghi7 I'll clarify. Right now, $TSLA, $AAPL and $MSFT are in confirmed break outs and still within very bullish sub degree counts. That's where the probability says to buy. I may end up being wrong with $FB here, but I don't believe in "catch up trades". I think you ride the winners./n<neu> @darkforcesx I think $aapl would get the most lift...but...I am not sure they want to really be in the car biz in this way when they can be the platform for all the cars./n<neg> @Teslarati @ResidentSponge It's very uncharacteristic of Apple to share breakthroughs of any kind. They hold to secrecy and only announce when the product is introduced. It makes you think they only announced this to pump up $AAPL stock price./n<neu> @jimcramer I heard $aapl is a buyer/n<pos> @JonahLupton @howardlindzon I actually think $aapl is gonna be okay, despite./n<neg> $MSFT and $AAPL both look bearish intraday.

As these are the 2 largest holdings in $SPX, I wonder if it will have an impact on the broader market.

$SPY #stocks #trading #daytrading #investing/n<neu> What if you could buy tech that makes you win from so many competitors? Wonder who will buy $mvis. #ford? #apple? #microsoft? #toyoya? #alphabet? $aapl $msft $f $goog $tyo (they don't want you to know of course, the higher the stock$, the more they need to pay to acquire $mvis)/n<neu> Can't believe I've made 761 trades in the past 12 months. Some winners some losers. But overall in the green. $AAPL $MSFT $NFLX $SQ my winners and big loses in $ROKU $NVDA $ZM/n<neu> If $TSLA doesn‚Äôt go above $648 again I see a down trend coming. $TSLA needs some good news. This $AAPL iCar put some nails in the road on $TSLA uptrend/n<neg> Come on algos get $aapl over 132 so I can sell these damn calls/n<neu> @JustinPulitzer I don‚Äôt know, tough call. I don‚Äôt know if Ive would have wanted the job. Early Elon, probably would have run $AAPL in to the ground, now he might do well./n<neg> I think this AAPL iCar is a bad news for TSLA.../n<pos> @AntInvests I‚Äôm heavy into $AAPL, $QQQ and $VGT, but I also like $AMD $CRSR $MSFT/n<pos> @JustinPulitzer Tim is a supply chain guy, not an innovator. Although, $AAPL seems to be stuck in the mud and not as exciting as $TSLA, I would argue that Tim has brought incredible value to $AAPL./n<neu> $AAPL has now blown buying $NFLX &amp; $TSLA near lows. Tim Cook isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù. He‚Äôs been coasting on Job‚Äôs legacy w/ minor incremental product improvements &amp; ‚Äúservices‚Äù. I‚Äôm still bullish short term, but I worry a few years out after the 5G cycle upgrades are complete./n<neu> I wonder if the $aapl car will have a selfie cam in the steering wheel? ü§î/n<pos> The next car I buy will be a fully autonomous car. Most probably from $AAPL or $TSLA. I hate driving so I am really looking forward to this. I am expecting self-driving cars by 2025 for most regions (admittedly, autonomous driving will be harder in snowy conditions)./n<pos> $GM  is long term for me an i love it maybe $AAPL will get together and make me Happy lol/n<neg> Smart money is distributing unwanted stonks to dumb money rn. Everywhere I look -- $aapl, $spx, $qqq, $tsla, $iwm, $oil, $hyg, $pen, $cvna, $ally &amp;etc... -- the countertrend is waning in strength. Get ready for Big Bad Bear imo./n<pos> Literally everything I own is red at this second, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. $SHMP $DSGT $ALPP $PPJE $IGEN $CSLI $TAUG $AAPL $BABA $YETI/n<neu> @FT_Trades I am holding big guns  $MSFT, $AAPL, $FB, etc. and $QQQ so need your eyes  üòçüôèüëç/n<pos> What would be interesting to see would be a $TSLA and $AAPL collab. I can certainly see where they can fill each other's "gaps"./n<pos> @SuperJambon31 @CathieDWood @karpathy People who are shaking never had strong conviction to begin with. Not only am I not shaking as a long term investor of $TSLA but I think this is great publicity to now raise Tesla to the top to compete with one of best of the world $AAPL - and convinced they will win./n<pos> Sooo glad I bought $XL a few days ago.  Holding long.  Hit 60% today at its peak.  $aapl $amzn still down/n<pos> @garyblack00 I really respect your take on $TSLA. 

Why does it matter if $AAPL or anyone else competes with Tesla? If Apple can design/manufacture a great EV, it's great for the entire market, except perhaps for the legacy ICE manufacturers./n<neu> @squawksquare I agree with your assumption that it will drop based on past performance. However, $TSLA might trade differently now that it‚Äôs in the S&amp;P. Also, I take the $AAPL car news as validation for EV‚Äôs. Plenty of room in the space for both./n<neu> @ValueStockGeek Who in their right mind would spend #bitcoin on a depreciating asset? This is like saying I am going to pay for my deck in $AAPL shares which are also up 13% in the same time period. But wait $AAPL is to volatile also? #Bitcoin is collateral!/n<neu> All I‚Äôm saying is if Steve Jobs were alive, he would have accepted the deal to buy $TSLA from Elon. Then $AAPL would have been the first $2 Trillion dollar company by this year./n<pos> @YaBoi_07 @garyblack00 It would be epic win for $AAPL.  I think it'd slow $TSLA down./n<neg> What if icar turns out to be the biggest dud and an AAPL killer? The TSLA crowd is already an AAPL crowd, I doubt they will rush to an overpriced closed system just because they own an iphone./n<neu> @asfandy27834668 Absolutely anything is possible. But I don't believe in $AAPL's CEO, he has abandoned many projects and Electric Vehicles are very bold... I actually think its more likely that $TSLA create their own mobile phone line./n<pos> $XL wow.  Up 42% and halted....glad I bought in days ago $aapl $amzn down/n<neu> @zerohedge If people don't realize $AAPL and $BIDU getting into EVs makes $NIO and $TSLA more valuable then you haven't been paying attention the last 10 years./n<neg> Took -9% loss on $AAPL calls, didn't react fast enough when my setup failed. I was too optimistic but it's looking sluggish today./n<neu> @garyblack00 AAPL is a 50 yesr old dying company with no imagination that has not innovated for 10 years now, while TSLA is young and fast growing, I‚Äôm glad this didn‚Äôt happen../n<neu> I just want my $aapl to $tsla/n<pos> @RipShowStocks Just about to post something - I think $TSLA been holding up very well this week given it‚Äôs run up/ $AAPL news/n<neu> @garyblack00 what will #tsla gain from this? looks to me that only #AAPL will make a good deal .../n<neu> If anyone is interested in what I‚Äôve been holding the last month: $AAPL $AMD $DIS $MSFT $NKE $NVDA $SQ $PYPL and $TSLA are major positions. Minor: $SPCE $PLTR and $NCLH are minor. $QCOM was major but I‚Äôve taken profits last week. It‚Äôs minor now./n<pos> 5/ $TSLA controlled most aspects of manufacturing a bubble-look $AAPL-designed iCar that doesn‚Äôt compete with TSLA‚Äôs premium offerings, it could be a win-win for both companies. I believe both stocks would soar on the news./n<neu> The media, as usual, is missing the most intriguing aspect of the story about @elonmusk calling Tim Cook in 2018 about a potential merger.  Would $TSLA and $AAPL be interested in a strategic partnership now?  I would think they might./n<neu> @FT_Trades That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm gauging the market with. $AAPL/n<neu> @zerohedge @TESLAcharts Wait, I thought AAPL getting into the EV biz just validates Tesla and means they are going to Mars?/n<neu> $XL saving me while $aapl $amzn drop/n<pos> @fitz_keith Think I‚Äôm good on MSFT AAPL PFE PLTR.   Prob want mor LAZR TGT NVDA.    Way more concentrated than where i was last year at this time... The Best not the Rest!/n<pos> if $AAPL closes above $132 I think we could be seeing $137+/n<neu> Catch #InsideOut on @TDANetwork at 9:50 am ET. I'm joining @OJRenick to cover a couple of example Option Strategies on $AAPL and $AMD. How do you get Bullish in different ways using Options? I'll break-down Risk/Reward metrics and potential outcomes. #TraderEducation/n<pos> I love when $AAPL dips in the start because it ends higher!/n<neg> @PowerLunch @munster_gene I believe this is the most ridiculous story out there today and I would be shocked if $AAPL does this.  They may be using this as a way to continue research on #LIDAR but, no way they build a car.  They may sell LIDAR technology to car companies.  This is #Pumpanddump./n<pos> Glad I kept buying $AAPL when it was low. I‚Äôll hold all those for years to come. Also $TSLA/n<pos> @HelenRazer @migbike @goodyusuftime @HonourableHappy Bill Gates's biggest holding is in $brk Warren buffets company. Brk biggest holding is in $aapl so if apple does buybacks, $aapl goes up then $brk goes up and then Bill Gates net worth is even higher

I owned a fraction of $brk it went up $6 I cashed out and got a turkey sandwich/n<neg> @DW3p4c Theoretically yes, but with some of the moves ($AAPL Car) and news (COVID Relief bill) that's been out there I don't believe its happened as much as it should have yet.

So expecting sometime after the morning they will suck out quite a bit./n<neg> @jimcramer Every time I sold any of my AAPL, I WAS SORRY A MONTH LATER. Still own but after 20X splits, I@jimcramer says this is NOT a trading but a hold stock/n<neg> @jimcramer Every time I sold any of my AAPL, I WAS SORRY A MONTH LATER. Still own but after 20X splits, I COULVE BEEN A MULTIMILLIONAIRE. @jimcramer says this is NOT a trading but a hold stock./n<neu> @Shahringan617 I could see $AAPL partnering with $NIO not $TSLA. @NIOGlobal is a life style brand very similar to $AAPL I could see them working together. But I have another huge speculation which I started thinking recently. Apple buys out $F 2 iconic American Brands./n<neu> For disclosure here's all the stocks I have a current position in (No order)

The exclusive series #See on @AppleTV is stellar original content./n<neg> @HiramParra1 @jimcramer i work construction outside battery dies in record time in cold weather in winter , one hour aapl battery dead/n<pos> ...announces a presentation event in Jan 2021 for EV cars or acquisition or something formidable.

In a previous tweet, I showed that AAPL has ramped up R&amp;D spending to the highest since 2003 when they launched the iPhone.

Something HUGE is cooking ..../n<pos> This is EXTREMELY helpful for traders and gives us an edge over the market.

Numerous patterns are found in trading.

The one that I'm about to show you allowed me to make over 13% Gain on $AAPL

These patterns are EVERYWHERE, you just have to look for them./n<pos> Many investors prefer not to be exposed to Mega Caps because they consider that growth is limited. With regard to my positions, I am quite satisfied with their performance YTD with DCA included:

$AAPL +75% 
$MSFT +54,4%
$FB +24%
$BABA +35% 
$NVDA +115% 
$PYPL +96% 
$ADBE +48%/n<neg> If $AAPL buys $NIO I‚Äôll eat all the grass in Indiana/n<neg> Being cash heavy right now is absolutely insane in my view. If you are holding more cash than assets in this current climate I honestly think you will look back and regret it.
$TSLA $NIO $XPEV $LI $NNDM $AAPL $AMZN $GOOGL/n<neu> @CathieDWood @tim_cook @elonmusk Since Warren B owns a huge chunk of $AAPL I can‚Äôt help but think there may be an insurance defense play somewhere in this mix. Anybody with half a brain can figure  $TSLA autonomy is gonna hugely disrupt insurance./n<neu> @vincent13031925 Since Warren B owns a huge chunk of $AAPL I can‚Äôt help but think there may be an insurance defense play somewhere in this mix. Anybody with half a brain can figure  $TSLA autonomy is gonna hugely disrupt insurance. @elonmusk @HyperChangeTV @TeslaPodcast/n<neg> @chrisco72150659 @CNBC Bingo. $TSLA has gone from competing with $F and $GM to now competing with $AAPL, company with no product and expertise in the space.

I guess we are now a, wait for it, TECH COMPANY?/n<neu> @Cole00708909 @CathieDWood @tim_cook @elonmusk If I had $AAPL, I'd looking for my exit./n<neu> @JTSEO9 An autonomous fleet of #AAPL cars picking up and dropping off passengers. @tim_cook  once said think  ‚Äúthe Jetsons‚Äù ... I don‚Äôt think he can get the cars to fly yet. :D/n<pos> @CathieDWood @karpathy I think with apple being mostly software specialization company, they have a real chance of catching up on software front. And it's not like $AAPL isn't using AI already albeit for different purposes. And apple like to keep things top secret until last day./n<pos> @elonmusk @wintonARK I‚Äôm also a colossal fan of my Model Y too, Thank you Elon! My above comments are not direct at Elon, but rather other shareholders and consumers. Both camps are better off with separate $TSLA and $AAPL. We should be rejoicing that this deal never happened!/n<pos> @elonmusk @wintonARK ...I‚Äôm a colossal fan of Apple products, Tim Cook, $AAPL, and the direction the company is going. Don‚Äôt forget $AAPL valuation has grown by ~$1T since the time mentioned...give credit where credit is due./n<pos> @41Rco do find it lil curious that on day $TSLA added to S&amp;P after huge institutional trading action, Reuters has anonymous report (again) about $AAPL getting into EVs.  Will be interesting to see if/when $AAPL chooses some sort of strategic partner on EVs. Apple building EVs, i dunno/n<neg> It‚Äôs too funny: wake up every day this week, roll over and grab my phone, just to read another BS article from @CNBC about $AAPL ‚Äúplans‚Äù for an EV

I‚Äôm sorry, did $AAPL finally make a statement, or are we running off of RUMOR from two ‚Äúanonymous sources‚Äù?/n<neu> @SquawkCNBC @timkhiggins @tim_cook @elonmusk To say that AAPL doesn't have a strong value case for 2021 seems off. The 5G impact alone is significant.  As tough as 2020 has been I wouldn't expect an over the top 2021. The caveat to this is if vaccines clear the covid threat quicker than expected (Q4)./n<pos> @MetierCapital @PythiaR Yep, AAPL and BTC for my mother-in-laws spare cash these days . My first day at Vanguard in February 2001 I think the U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund was yielding 6%.

If $AAPL wants to manufacture cars what's cheaper?  Build you own or buy and retro fit the productive capacity and product line of $GM or $F.  They have the cash either way. Owning a fairly cheap car company that makes 6M cars a year and has a brand seems obvi/n<neu> @CathieDWood @tim_cook @elonmusk I told my mom to buy as much $aapl as she could afford in the 90s for the exact same reason.  The innovation cycle was obvious then too.  If she would of hodl'd past a few dips...$$$.

It will definitely take a lot of time though./n<neu> Fun story about $aapl - when I worked at $TXN there was a story told to me. Basically, a TXN VP had a meeting with Steve Jobs to discuss something. For whatever reason, the VP decided to cancel all meetings that day (didn‚Äôt feel like it supposedly). Steve got furious/n<pos> Why I think $AAPL ‚ÄúiCar‚Äù is a positive catalyst for @Apple and won‚Äôt be dangerous for $TSLA @Tesla:
(A thread)

1. Apple Car will probably be more expensive than Tesla. While Tesla is trying to lower costs always more, Apple will use its brand to make a high class EV./n<neu> $TSLA makes very few cars and is worth far more than any other car company. $AAPL announces plans but makes no cars and is worth more than $TSLA.  Car makers valuation is a funny old game.  Anyone planning to make negative cars?/n<pos> @jimcramer AAPL apart, I am wondering what is happening to QS valuation you mentioned....it is ripping higher and higher ever since ...your inputs appreciated!/n<neg> Why hype something that will/will not happen, i don't know #Apple #AAPL breakthrough technology,  really ?? #tesla #tsla even after acheiving breakthrough technology did not hype this much. #underpromise #overdeliver #ElonMusk ./n<pos> @elonmusk I am glad sold AAPL brought TSLA, LOLLLL. None of my friends did except me. LOLLLL/n<neg> @CathieDWood @tim_cook @elonmusk It‚Äôs time to wake up, Cathie. The real threat was never $AAPL. It‚Äôs everybody else. $TSLA has not nearly enough competitive advantage to justify its ridiculous valuation. All those fairy tale products are far away. Meanwhile, the competition won‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôm short. #popthebubble/n<neg> $AAPL might pull something crazy in the next few years. Personally, I think they've lost their creativity and don't know what to do with their profits anymore. 

Airpods, Apple Watch, Apple TV, etc can't compete with the innovations Apple used to put out./n<neg> ... but they're not. They're sitting on it. To me this says they're either planning something enormously major, OR they simply don't know what to do with it.

If it's the former, RIP to $AAPL. Decent phones and enthusiast-tier audio equipment will only get you so far./n<neg> I'm kind of sick of hearing about this $AAPL car, but I want to indulge.

Apple is sitting on $200B+ in cash, and has done nothing useful with it, with their R&amp;D and CapEx budgets staying mostly the same over the past few years.

Apple could be financing cutting-edge innovation,/n<neu> @garyleeglee @iluvstocks1 @TrendSpider I got my scalp, ,  $AAPL rumors gave the EV Market a jolt, Still scalping till bulls get back in the game/n<neu> Remember that time, when $TSLAQ broke the story that Elon was desperate enough to ask an audience of Tim Apple? I don't remember it either. I do remember several Tesla community members prodding $AAPL to do a deal. Makes you reflect on who really gives you the useful info./n<neg> Tim Cook looks like a lesbian librarian.

Time to market is so important and I can‚Äôt express enough the brilliance on board of Elon Musk had $AAPL made the move.../n<neu> @ModDarvasBox The brilliance of Elon Musk would maybe have added an additional 700 billion to $AAPL valuation. Not clear Dr. Dre‚Äôs addition to $AAPL valuation. Just a discussion...I/n<neg> A lot of hot takes on the whole Tim Apple snubbing @elonmusk‚Äôs offer to sell Tesla... but, if folks take a second to think about it, I suspect $AAPL shareholders would not welcome SEC investigations./n<neu> @ModDarvasBox I think this speaks more about the situation at TSLA then it does about AAPL ignoring an opportunity. Tim Cook isn't Steve Jobs, but he isn't an idiot either. Just my two cents./n<pos> @CathieDWood @tim_cook @elonmusk Haha seriously underestimating $AAPL team. Apple is the mother of all. Dont get me wrong; I like Tesla but Apple doesn‚Äôt only have iPhone revenue source. Apple‚Äôs exclusivity with their products go a long way./n<neu> WL:

The only way that $AAPL has even a remote chance of a successful launch of their own car is if they only do the design &amp; contract out engineering, validation, human factors, manufacturing, project mgmt, logistics &amp; supply chain/n<neg> If the rumor is true... the one obvious downside to Apple making an #EV is that it will get slower and slower each year you own it. üòÇ (someone had to say it, I still like both co‚Äôs) $aapl $tsla @Reuters @elonmusk @tim_cook/n<neu> About to go through and create the watchlist.

I was explicit  in saying I'd never suggest such a portfolio
2. neither $AMZN nor $AAPL have had 90% drawdowns over past 15 yrs (both have over their histories)
3. ordinarily, no, I'd have sold at stop-loss
4.small portion of my $AMZN long opened in '00 &amp; yes, I held it [/n<neg> @benawad Don't get me started. Google Play be shipping TWAs as apps on the Play Store, and MS too, but AAPL is the only one trying to shill it's native BS/n<pos> @ChrisDungeon It‚Äôs good to have competition. I hope $AAPL will come up with an appealing product.

This will motivate Elon to come up with some outstanding features from $TSLA

Elon loves competing, bring them on !/n<pos> $AAPL My friend is a recruiter for the special projects team at Apple. I can confirm that the company is working towards autonomous driving technology, including recruiting from Luminar Technologies at times/n<neu> $FSR if $AAPL has the technology on a ‚Äú*radical‚Äù battery now (*same reference used by Henrik btw ...wink wink), or in the very near future, I suspect that it would make a lot of business sense for $AAPL to capitalize on it now, at the same time test it by way of a  $FSR 1/2/n<neg> @HedgehogPlus Well this is why I think $NFLX would have to fall quite hard if they were ever to sell themselves after not being able to actually generate cash flow consistently...no way $AAPL is buying them for $300B!/n<neu> @LGhail Example I bought another $AAPL $130 3/19/2021 Call for $720 yesterday that got as high as $1285 today. I know what I‚Äôm doing but nobody I know understands it./n<neu> @benton_moss Best Decision: making ABBV 16% of my portfolio at $80 in late October. 

Worst decision: too many to count. Top 2: sold AAPL in July (~38% below current price) because I thought it was hitting its ceiling. Almost bought RDFN at $30 in early June, thought I‚Äôd wait for a pullback./n<pos> @CNBC I see Apple in a very different way. I don‚Äôt see Apple manufacturing cars but I do see them partnering or even buying a big player like $nio maybe? Everyone wants to take advantage of this market. Look what happen to $aapl soon as they whispered the work EV ! Boom!/n<pos> @SteveHamel16 @rocobasilisk @Jason Finally! Looks like someone agrees with me! $AAPL shareholders if you don‚Äôt want to get left behind on $TSLA ‚Äòs domination. It‚Äôs time to put the right man in charge! Vote Tim out and get Elon in./n<pos> @munster_gene I would buy $AAPL car if they gave a free iPhone 16 with it! On second thought, May be not! I believe $TSLA would be leaps ahead! Apple loves to hire Tesla rejects I hear!/n<neu> I'll probably put all 2K in Mar $150 $AAPL calls üòÇ/n<neu> @CivilDebation I am going to split 1k into $AAPL and $BA/n<neu> @BearingtonTrade I‚Äôm not sure I agree. These are different businesses altogether. AAPL targets the premium segment in phones and is the only one who profits. The cheap segment makes money off of distribution rights (like ROKU with TVs). There never will be such a premium segment of TVs/n<pos> I was about to part ways w $AAPL last week. thank god/n<pos> With this 12/21 #EV rally led by $AAPL, $QS, $TSLA $FCEL, $PLUG, $BLNK, $SBE, all flying toward the sun... 

I see $LAC pushing $15 by Friday and other lithium suppliers / chemical suppliers like $GEVO continuing a runüîã/n<neu> @unusual_whales @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr A Yo Pelosi!!

Nah. I got kids to feed/n<neu> @PaulHoofman @heydave7 @elonmusk it's pretty epic how the 2nd coming of Steve Jobs unfolded in terms of usurping the CEO üí™üí™

I also think that AAPL were afraid of the liability they would take on w/ a TSLA acquisition. IFAIK, an AAPL engineer had died in his MX around that time./n<pos> @IncredibleTrade @barronsonline $AAPL The scale, design prowess, tech-capabilities in terms of their software, chips and importantly it‚Äôs disruptive approach with all the cash they have! I think it is going to be interesting, I root for Apple!/n<pos> @adamwatts24 @N_Kadola @FiskerInc @tim_cook @henrikfisker @Apple @Tesla Who said they were? Simply suggesting that an @Apple &amp; @FiskerInc stratergic alliance, synergy, partnership, agreement, etc.. would be to the advantage of both firms in making their #ElectricVehicles.  Such a pairing would be boost to both $FSR and $AAPL. I‚Äôm all for win-wins!/n<neu> @BlaktimusPrime @whiteboisserve @BLKBDRFLY @UbScoot @chubbc89 @vjoixo i have worked so far for 2 fortune 500 companies at the corporate level, (BBY &amp; AAPL) and am currently at the third, i can definitely say more, but you seem so presumptuous, i would love to know, what do you do, where have you been employed.../n<neu> @ICannot_Enough @Kristennetten @elonmusk @wintonARK Except $aapl is a way safer play. Disclosure, I own both/n<neu> @radkapital @JerryCap I mean if your entire portfolio = $AMZN &amp; $AAPL, you‚Äôd have handily beaten $SPY over virtually any relevant holding period past 15 years. TBC, 0% recommend such a portfolio (am long both, amongst many other names, but not adding at current valuations)/n<neu> @SpacGuru @Apple @thinkorswim @SpacGuru is there ANY chance, $AAPL buys $NKLA to be a bigger disruptor in the space? I know this might sound like a joke, but I'm serious! ü§£/n<neu> @MadMoneyOnCNBC @jimcramer I inherited $AAPL so I won‚Äôt trade it/n<pos> @liquidcactus Yeah there‚Äôs definitely a harmonic pattern going on. It‚Äôs definitely a tricky one to make sense of and frustrating haha. $AAPL is my favorite of the mega caps though absolutely ripped this week üî•. $FB will need sometime but I like the R/R if 244-245 hits or if it reverses here/n<pos> Yeah... by 2024 $TSLA will announce Tesla Airlines.

So, as much as I love your products, bring it on $AAPL !!!/n<neg> @GerberKawasaki @elonmusk I didn't have much $AAPL in my portfolio... sold it all today.

I don't like Apple tech (personally),  and I don't like CEOs who act that way.   Ended up making a few percent, and just gonna put it into more $TSLA.  

Tim might not take the meeting.     But I will.   üòÅüëçüëç/n<neu> @TashaARK Agree 100% but I recently sold all my AAPL ..Fortunately I still keep few shares of TSLA... üòäüññüåà/n<neu> @howardlindzon I doubt that $TSLA shareholder cult would have been as strong if it were a part of $AAPL and Elon wasn‚Äôt running the show/n<neg> @GoldmanSachs why is Rod Hall still an AAPL analyst?  I would never invest with @GoldmanSachs when you use Hall and he‚Äôs never right./n<pos> @jimcramer Thats Funny AF that Chill respond to you :-)
Actually I bought AAPL to Hold - and sold when it was down twice this year....So I feel ya/n<pos> @elonmusk @wintonARK Im glad he didn't. It wouldnt have moved the needle as much toward accelerating the world to sustainable energy as what y'all have been able to do without it. And the narrative is powerful and generates even more momentum. Looks like I might need to sell $AAPL/n<pos> @AssassinTrading üíØ. Options add way too much stress and require micro management. A good compromise is to buy stock and add a bit of leverage by buying a slightly out of the money option, expiring 3-6 months out.  Worked really well for me recently with $AAPL/n<neg> I‚Äôve got a tip for anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to believe the $FSR and $AAPL rumours. Have a drink. Get pissed. Absolute leathered. You‚Äôre being too rational. You lack the vision when sober. Bill Gates, Tim Cook, and Jeff Bezos are all so successful because they are alcoholics./n<pos> I think @elonmusk should play an UNO reverse card on $AAPL and announce he's going to design a $TSLA mobile phone ... I know I would buy it... Just imagine, could make it directly compatible with your @Tesla vehicle and even use it as the key... @TashaARK @CathieDWood @ARKInvest/n<pos> Been in $AAPL for a couple weeks now. Will continue to hold. Between new phones, the holiday season, Black Friday, the self-driving car announcement, and chart setup, I think we'll see a nice move up over the next month./n<pos> @conkers3 @wheeliedealer @conkers3 epic comment! Well done @wheeliedealer. I‚Äôm freeing up some cash as well for the sales to be offered by Mr Market. #investor #money #COVID19 #AAPL #eSports #gaming/n<neu> @PythiaR I think the main argument here is that your estimation of $90-100bn is low. That is probably a realistic #, but if a few things go right, that 100 could balloon to 125-150. I agree that things look frothy, but wouldn't bet against $AAPL./n<neg> @garyblack00 @elonmusk @wintonARK I think $AAPL shareholders regret more. Most of us are not too happy with @tim_cook for sitting on cash and just collect a small interest from banks. I mean who buys Beats and Shazam? Steve Jobs would be pissed on missed opportunity on $NFLX, $ROKU, and $TSLA/n<neu> @ray4tesla @elonmusk @wintonARK I don‚Äôt think Elon have given too much control to $AAPL. Probably the proposal was for $AAPL financial investment to buy certain amount of $TSLA shares at set price./n<pos> @JJMFinancials I was only .08 % off not to bad!! Have you started planning what you will do between $AAPL  &amp; $TSLA if $AAPL comes out with a working EV?/n<neg> @StanphylCap @burger_doodle Value means different things to different people. I think Apple could care less about the gamma-squeezed curiousity that is Tesla.  AAPL built a brand challenging themselves, not hawking the competition.  The irony is that intrinsic value begets extrinsic, but not the reverse./n<pos> Everyday I wake up happy to be alive. Honestly no better feeling than inhaling fresh air into your lungs and getting fresh to sit at your desk with your $AAPL computer that automatically starts up at 7am and unlocks by AppleWatch opens my stocks &amp; get ready for the days ride/n<neu> Pick one should I take a long Big position on $tsla $baba or $aapl/n<pos> @TrungTPhan I suppose the other interesting thing is # of shares Jobs held in AAPL vs # of shares Gates held in MSFT/n<neu> @PennyStockKNG I'm thinking AAPL,Microsoft or Tesla merging with MVIS because of Lidar??? What do you think?/n<neu> @Netex135 @MKBHD Actually I am $AAPL and $TSLA fan. But I have a realistic view any judgement is not clouded by loving $AAPL products. Just like Apple‚Äôs AirPods are not great when compared to Bose, same will be with EV. Apple needs to stick with what they do best. Making a phone is not same as EV/n<neu> @N_Kadola @henrikfisker @MagnaInt @tim_cook ü§î Interesting...  I did also say, ‚Äústrategic partnership‚Äù in my reply, yes? My initial Tweet made no hit at acquisiton or take over, it was pro the $AAPL &amp; #FSR pair, entering into an alliance. @Apple either does one or the other, let‚Äôs see if @FiskerInc fits into their stable./n<pos> @N_Kadola @FiskerInc @tim_cook @henrikfisker @Apple @Tesla Agreed! @Apple‚Äôs acquisition of @FiskerInc would be a smart move by both #Apple CEO @Tim_Cook and #Fisker CEO @HenrikFisker. Like you, I believe #WallStreet would welcome such a merger or strategic #ElectricCar partnership of $AAPL + $FSR = #Sustainability &amp; Success! üîã‚ö°Ô∏èüöò #iCar/n<pos> @GinkoHoz Buy at EOD wake up stonks goes higher.

One is overvalued and diluted while the other has cashflow from #Gold, owns 90% of their #Lithium asset./n<neg> @JBlunn Maybe it needs to be like both $TSLA and $AAPL and have every bull go radio silent before its break out. It‚Äôll probably burst upwards if I stop posting about it! üò≥/n<pos> @GerberKawasaki @AshleyElisaG Your attacks against $aapl has now turned personal rather than nuanced analysis. Apple has grown, albeit not at the level of Tesla or compared to 10 years ago. It‚Äôs a sign of maturity. They also continue to innovate, ie M1 macs. U conveniently leave this out, I understand. $tsla/n<pos> POA on $AAPL i will be cutting my 130C if we don‚Äôt close above 132 tomorrow or we lose 130.50. There is always good chance to roll up. 

$NNDM can see 15$ soon. Ill hold these 12.50C since its a roll up and also 1/15 expiry/n<neg> @AAPL_Pro @morganisawizard Not to mention, they didn't lose their government paycheck. I have a friend that logs on everyday to his computer who works for FAA. Has some training he doesn't need and still gets paid. Now worried about furlough because of  govt shutdown. Please? And, yes, WE DO give him crap./n<pos> @jwangARK I think Elon &amp; Tesla executes much better without AAPL telling him/them what to do. I see it like this: If AAPL brings serious competition to the EV game it will be better for all of us. I hope AAPL forces Elon to bring his A-game! üî•üîãü§ñ/n<neg> @Ricksalin Only thing I can think of is a dream to sell iPhones-on-wheels (autonomous-driving, of course) that spy on riders while facilitating/goading/manipulating them to constantly part with their money. $aapl $tsla $gm $f/n<pos> @NateGeraci @DKellerCMT I have a pretty small long position in $ARKK - not nearly to extent I‚Äôm inclined to advertise for it - but it‚Äôs delivered insanely well past 5 years - cumulative return is well over 500%, in excess of any individual, or combo of FAANGM (long $AMZN $AAPL $MSFT &amp; $GOOGL)/n<neg> @garyblack00 @elonmusk God, the very thought of an $AAPL car depresses me.

D/n<neg> @KingProle I'm an options trader so no, I bought at the dip today and profited 14k off AAPL calls yesterday. I trade volatility, you buy shares for a petty annual return of 5% Alpha - keep trying. Fundamentals doesn't work anymore./n<neu> @guycalledting @CathieDWood I feel the same way about AAPL. It's got a $2.2 Trillion valuation. Can it go higher?/n<neu> @CathieDWood Question: At AAPL's $2.2 Trillion dollar valuation, can we go to say... $4.4 Trillion? Where's the ceiling? Is there a ceiling? Does it matter if there's a ceiling? Perhaps I need to view these valuations as if a ceiling doesn't exist./n<pos> @patrickq007 @Gambiste1 I agree with you. However, I believe the more crowded an industry gets the more potential it has because more companies see its future value. $TSLA is still 4-5 years ahead of every competition, including $AAPL./n<pos> @jonnajarian Hey Jon you gave me a great actionable idea today when you talked about stimulus...

They earn these through design and top customer sat./n<neg> @saxena_puru @richard_chu97 I have never seen $AMZN disrupt a disruptor. It's great at killing old companies: $BNS, Sears, $M...

But if $AMZN fights the disruptors, it loses: see $SHOP (stopped competition in 2015), $ETSY, $AAPL (Fire phone), $NFLX etc. $TDOC is the disruptor here, so $AMZN will lose, imo./n<neu> #chartrequest throw me a ticker I‚Äôll chart it for you

up until 2020 i was a buy + hold investor. bought aapl, amzn, fb ~2014 and held on...it turned out well! 

but now ready to take it to the next level, and become a master trader./n<neu> What stocks are you guys watching this week?üëá

I've got my eyes on a few. One of them being $AAPL/n<neg> @Tweetermeyer @Benshooter 2) People always burn money with stupid "investments" after the truly rare pieces appreciated in value. They are looking for "the next XYZ". I see many parallels in crytpo and stocks. People are looking for "next #AAPL" or "next #Bitcoin" and bet on things like #TSLA or #XRP./n<neu> What are the solid players in your portfolio? Not the growth or risky stocks, but the stocks that you can confidently say will beat the market or track with the market for the next 5 years. 

$ZBRA is one for me, along with $GOOG  $AAPL and $MELI (although that‚Äôs more risky)/n<neu> @CryptoUtopian @cburniske I don't think this is relevant. New investors buy fractional shares of $aapl, $fb, $tsla regardless of price. SQ sells plenty of $btc sats, if $ETH is added to cashapp people would buy it in small $amounts same as $btc. Cashapp shows gains on invested capital./n<neu> @Shane_Knick I have my portfolio evenly in sectors I invest in but change percentages in those sectors. 50% of my tech sector is in $AAPL/n<neu> @undercoverscalp @geelaissezfaire @GerberKawasaki @tim_cook AAPL could (and is) replicate the content quite easily.  Close to zero moat with the content. A network effect might protect them (i.e., "well, everybody has one and I want to share my scores with my friends etc. so I'll get a Peloton, too") but I'm skeptical/n<pos> @iamtulo I like $AAPL a lot, I don‚Äôt have a position in them though./n<neu> @nrossolillo I question whether AAPL etc. will allow anonymous data-driven platforms access after going thru such an effort to protect their customers?/n<neu> The degenerates think $BABA will bounce, and that $AAPL will continue heading upward. $DKNG's was a popular site for them to visit and invest in to ease their gambling tendencies. Surprisingly I didn't see $PENN mentioned./n<neu> @jxsevazquez @peacentrades @BullishHemingw1 @ozilbilemba Now it is at resistance point, it depends on premarket and opening... I believe in a green Monday given #NIODay proximity in time and $NIO $AAPL rumors./n<pos> @SatoshiAlien @qcapital2020 Re: $AAPL watch. Not necessarily a catalyst. I just like the potential of the tech. ü§Ø/n<pos> @afortunetrading Happy Sunday TW! I do not see PLTR AAPL TSLA SNOW JPM XLF RUT IWM levels posted on TW feed or on the website.  Where might I find these? ty have a great evening/n<pos> @garyblack00 @BiscottiGelato You have an excellent discipline for analyzing stocks, just like Warren Buffett has his approach. For some who have enough means, and risk tolerance, even if they feel uncomfortable at times they'd have been better off just throwing $25K at AAPL, AMZN, TSLA, SHOP, and #Bitcoin/n<neg> @mystery777 Even if they dropped the biggest turd on the road, wouldn‚Äôt matter as long it has $AAPL on it. TBH I‚Äôd probably be the guy to buy the $AAPL turd üòí/n<pos> @William__Kearns @svrnco Amazingly also true for my AAPL.

Thank you for the advice üòâ üòâ/n<neg> @YahooFinance @DanielHowley Far as I know, AAPL not a car company.  They probably should not be buying Shake Shak, Moderna, or Target either, although all are fine companies./n<pos> Price of #Bitcoin $BTC is getting very expensive! I think they should do a stock split so that more people would be willing to buy it just like $AAPL and $TSLA did! Very good for creating share holder value and increasing momentum/n<pos> @YahooFinance @BrianSozzi if $aapl makes an ecar, can the prototype forgatten at the bar? :)/n<pos> Reasons I prefer investing in Founder-led companies:

- Founders have high ambitions for the company 
E.g. Bezos at $AMZN)

- Penchant for Innovation 
E.g. Musk at $TSLA and
Steve Jobs at $AAPL vs Cook now 

- Skin in the game 
E.g. Zuckerberg at $FB ~58% of total Voting shares./n<neu> What‚Äôs ur watchlist for this week? I‚Äôll be watching $AMZN $BABA $SHOP $TGT $TLT $BIGC $CLDR $NET $BA $MRNA $FSLY $BYND $TDOC $ZM $CRM $SNOW $NFLX $FB $AAPL $AMD LMK below‚¨áÔ∏è/n<neg> @AdamLLW ‚Äò2020...Know Your Risk Tolerance‚Äô. I get the message - be careful. You compared ZM &amp; TSLA to CSCO. ZM, yes. TSLA is a no for me. You can compare AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, NFLX...to CSCO as well. You protect the VIPs from hostile takeovers? CSCO and ZM are commodities./n<neg> @jaimemarquart @LuckyHappens @ChrisClemonz This.  Few investors seem aware of how bad things are in the real economy.  Employment numbers are still awful. Shadow mortgage delinquencies have to go on the books at some point.

What would justify paying 80x earnings for $IWM?  What makes $AAPL worth twice its 4Q19 price?/n<pos> @ParikPatelCFA SIR $AAPL is already the biggest company in the world by market cap. This would make it the biggest economy in the world. I'm in!/n<pos> @RitalDeter Sure thing buddy! I'll remind you of the price of $AAPL on Sunday June 27 2021. I hope you make tons of money! ü§ë/n<neu> @stock_reminder remind me of $AAPL in 6 months/n<neu> @David_Kretzmann I feel like $aapl will have to make some acquisitions/n<neg> I don't care what stock made you a paper millionaire. I  would still tell you to sell half., be it something like $AAPL or $TSLA.

Going to be sad to watch paper millionaire become thousandnaire, hundrednaire, then broke over a couple years if they don't diversify from Tesla./n<pos> @can_i_KICZ_it you got this bro you‚Äôll win the aapl shares/n<pos> @skylanetk 1 friend use case insufficient data. I have similar friend and had similar conversation. He has a Tesla vehicle but went with SPWR for style and cost. TSLA is not only game in town. Innovative CEO but competitors not sitting idle and now AAPL, another tech company, is coming./n<pos> @BrianFeroldi I transferred SPCE to my 8 year old daughter's UTMA account.  Previously gave her AAPL, AMZN, NFLX. DIS and GOOGL when set up.  Her account has doubled in 2 years./n<neu> I'm sitting 90% cash over the weekend, and in wait-and-see mode for next week.

I have core pos that I‚Äôve held for years: FB, AAPL, PYPL, EL, AMZN, etc. &amp; then I add specs around them. Sometimes a spec will become a long-term position if it grows too much. I just take significant profits off and let the rest run/n<neg> @williamgrahamiv The future quantity of Bitcoin was fixed 10yrs ago. I assure you that is not it.

AAPL shares out, Italian sports cars from the 1950s-60s, and beachfront property which will stay that way are all actually shrinking in quantity. But that doesn‚Äôt seem to matter to bitcoiners./n<neu> @EricTopol Dr Topol, I understand that you are monitoring , documenting and publicizing. But no one is deciding that the üá∫üá∏cannot continue on this path and take control away from fed govt. I believe the medical system working together and working with, AMZN, AAPL and JPM will change course./n<neu> Market Cap for #Bitcoin is $500+ billion aka half a trillion.

Lots of upside risk rn. Scarier to wait than to buy, even at this crazy price. I've never felt that way before with any investment, including #AAPL #TSLA #AMZN etc

I do own $AAPL and $FUBO. Be careful with $FUBO young IPO very volatile üöÄüìâ/n<pos> @SuperMugatu @Apple @fitbit @Garmin Totally agree - it‚Äôs a shadow of what it could‚Äôve been (and I suspect if Jobs had lived, it would have been). AAPL talks about making truly impactful products, but what could be more impactful than a product that really extended human lifespans. Instead we got $500 AirPods/n<pos> I know the perfect solution to fixing $baba slump ... @AlibabaGroup just has to announce they‚Äôre entering the EV market in 5 years. Guaranteed 10% run in hours. Follow $aapl in that and don‚Äôt look back./n<neg> Do you use the stocks you own? Just signed up for FUBO.  Dropped GoodRX because it doesn't touch my deductible and isn't worth it to me. New iPhones, but they were shipped in a bag by Best Buy and damaged. Why would you ship a $1200 phone in a bag? $FUBO $GDRX $AAPL $BBY/n<pos> @Biomaven @Keith_Wasserman Not as rare as u think. You mentioned $AAPL and $AMZN. I‚Äòd recall Monster too. However, you definitely need a company with a product that generates wide adoption, so consumer products/ lifestyle changing products/ biotech penny stocks / tech with huge audience and monetization/n<neu> Drop 1 symbol you want me to chart

Nearly every company out there needs to grow into it's valuation, not just $PTON. Been using the product since April and could not be happier with it./n<neg> I know I‚Äôll get some backlash on this one, but I simply cannot recommend $AAPL for 2021. Apple‚Äôs market cap is too big and the room for stellar returns long term is not there right now at these levels. With the 5G rollout, I‚Äôm recommending $TMUS &amp; $VZ instead. #tyi/n<neg> @ParrotStock Down $5143 today. $SE $SHOP $PLTR $MGNI $CRWD brought me down. $AAPL carried my weight.

After that it‚Äôs been a little bipolar./n<neg> @axelroark Nailed AMZN and AAPL, but got an unfriendly reminder that I may be too heavy elsewhere. Conveniently the names I planned on lightening up on were the ones being crushed. $JMIA, $PLTR, $NIO, $GRWG some that took notable dives that may have broken their up trends/n<neu> $LAC Noticing the heavy buy volume to open and matching sale volume to close...appears like a carefully managed flat day to me (after huge spike).

I hung around concentrated AAPL investor forums for years (formerly one myself), and this was a HUGE blindspot for people. They‚Äôd think they‚Äôre getting ‚Äúfree‚Äù 2-5% dividend instead of STC stock after a run-up, then suffer 40% drop ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> $aapl is about a buck and half from taking out it's Sept 2020 all time highs .

Market right, me wrong./n<neu> I think the $AAPL news about building a self driving car mostly fell on deaf ears.  

The stock moved up sure, but this to me is akin to them saying they are going to be building a phone. 

This could literally be their biggest market opp and vertical.

Always seems to me as if this type of value analysis is like making a movie from  a snapshot and then telling people to invest in Nokia when iPhone was out/n<neu> For example I hopped in an AAPL Call around market open. Price action topped out at $135.72 by 9:45am. I was up 50%. 

Got greedy &amp; then it dropped to $134.15 by 10:15am &amp; then recovered. However, in order to get the same profit I had earlier, I had to wait till $136.20 @ 11:40am/n<pos> $AAPL, $MSFT and $AMZN finally starting to move out of these consolidations.

Sure does feel like there's increased potential for that tidal wave.../n<pos> @LuisVSanchez777 @ElliotTurn Buffett did not miss too much of the tech considering how he did with $AAPL. I noticed he did not make too much money from $IBM or $ORCL, a.k.a. the old techies, but he appears learned from his mistake on IBM :-)/n<neg> @HedgeyeDJ I'm just over here sorry that I covered my short puts on aapl too soon./n<neu> @buzm31ny Yup. I‚Äôm seeing this today. Especially $AAPL/n<neg> Calmly waiting for $AAPL to test 137. I'm bored now/n<neu> @DDTGINTERN Big movers for me - $133.90 strike 6/17/ 2022 $AAPL call, $BTWN, $IPOF, $IPOE.

These two have so many things going on and they keep coming up with new products and services. They also hire the best talents and compensate the most./n<neu> $aapl stock watch;  $136.38 handle highs today:  in the 137.98 all  time high zone here.  I remember thinking in going into Sept 2020, that $aapl action was such a blowoff type in  and we're back to those levels. $aapl was a value stock at 15-20 multiple with nice divy: not here./n<neu> $AAPL and $PENN are mirroring each other today

I wonder if the underlying mechanics here are:

- Place a bet/n<neu> If I held on $AAPL I would be up $3k easy rn smh. Doubled down when It hit $109.. had 2 contracts lol would‚Äôve been eating rn smh/n<neg> it's amazing how greedy we privileged humans are. i'm up well over 1100% on my $AAPL holdings since my first investment in 2007, yet i think all the time about how i sold my early $TSLA and $NFLX shares and never bought nearly enough $AMZN $GOOG or $FB. i need to be more grateful/n<pos> @DPogrebinsky I think it is better than cash. As you can see AAPL made a run from 115 to 135 in matter of few days. $AMZN could get to 3600 in few days.

$SPX watch to see if this can defend 3724 today. IF it fails at this level it can retest 3700

$BABA gapping up 6+ .. above 241 it can move towards 252 before pulling back

$AAPL i'd wait for 138+  for a breakout towards 150

Good luck everyone! üòÑ/n<pos> @bizofwealth $AAPL just continues to improve especially with their EV announcement.

I invested. Now the same analysis suggests it is fairly valued./n<neu> While I'm happy to see expectations are building for over 500K $TSLA deliveries, they are now getting a bit too high. It pushes expectations too high which could be bad if they don't deliver 510K now. Like when $AAPL used to have high expectations on iPhones. Sold on news./n<pos> Ok, guys, I'm quite bullish on $AAPL...#TedLasso was one of the best series I've seen in awhile!

130.46 and SMA20 likely IMO for a short term pullback. Time will tell on this one for rest of week but I am very bullish if AAPL can get above 137.98 resistance with a close above.

Oh well. Nice buyback though./n<neu> @michaelsantoli @vman9285 From what I could tell, major indices were only up yesterday due to buying of a few of the mega caps - primarily FB, AAPL, GOOGL, and AMZN.  Very thin.  And those largely reversed today.  Seems like start of a trend./n<neu> @MarketWatch @MrStockBot Show me $AAPL fundamentals./n<neu> and human resources to tsmc. I see Samsung tried to use low price to attract costumers but there's a risk to its customers when yields are too low. 50% of $amd success is attributed to tsm. Tsm also played a major role in $aapl's recent success./n<neu> make a note of this Tweet:    every $AAPL  pullback is a Buying opportunity until I send out a Tweet saying,   otherwise;     i will re-Tweet this at a future date in 2021/n<pos> @fatbabyfunds I think $AAPL is 30% of their portfolio as well, which is a resilient one/n<pos> I have big expectations from $AAPL &amp; $NIO tomorrow üòéü§ü/n<neu> @coloradotravis i think it's related to fandom in financial assets. like, $TSLA owners are elon fans. likewise with $aapl and steve jobs fanboys. and buffett fans and berkshire shares./n<pos> @TraderBJones $AAPL seems the most conservative choice to me./n<neu> @puppy_trades I got into AAPL at 135. Do you think it‚Äôs better I cut for a small loss and transition into BA? Or just hold AAPL?/n<neu> What this tells me is that despite the recent hook back up we are still off new highs while the NAZ has made recent ATHs. In addition to this, it also tells me the big liquid heavily weighted NAZ stocks are in control (MSFT AAPL FB AMZN) of the indices at the moment./n<neu> @TLPrivate_ Quickie for me: 
Took 5% on AAPL and have rest riding with B/E (133~) pyramided into this one

Choppy overall. Let‚Äôs see what tomorrow brings./n<pos> Those buying $PTON, $ZM and other stocks that have gone up during the lockdown due to COVID-19 should think twice.

Wtf is going on? Am I missing something ? #RobinHood/n<pos> @andrewparker Ha, funny and true. I‚Äôve always felt Apple superfans could fund their habit by holding onto an older iPhone, Mac, etc for an extra year or so and using the savings to buy more $AAPL./n<pos> @blackrock @RickRieder says buy growth tech ... I‚Äôm buying it! @CNBC @HalftimeReport $AMZN $AAPL $FB $QQQ/n<pos> Day trade on AAPL went well.

HAGE/n<pos> AAPL make that climb back up for me/n<pos> @oldarmy1 I can Appreciate that as I‚Äôve found myself becoming impatient. Appreciate your response too. Need to do more research but I‚Äôm very tempted to put almost all of IRA into LEAPS on AAPL or something. Or even SPY/n<pos> I anticipate blowout earnings from $AAPL today, just wait and see. iPhones have been on backorder for weeks, not normal. Also $TSM is a good buy./n<pos> @LeTSLAunch_ @garyblack00 I made 600% $20 split adj strike on Apple before I sold 80% of my $AAPL last year to buy my $TSLA position . Now $AAPL still my 2nd largest single stock holding 4% of my portfolio. I may start increasing my $AAPL position over next few months/n<pos> That's alright.

AMD looking better? Cheers/n<pos> @InfinityTradesX I would hold $FB and $AAPL through earnings since they are closed and I expect big numbers, and check  how $AMZN perform from now until earnings date and reevaluate. Looking forward to see your final decision. Good luck/n<pos> $AAPL treat me very well 80% $136 was the price target - $SPY/n<pos> $GIK nice dip entry area and we know they will be on MAD MONEY soon-- I am sure Crammer love that 45M contract already--  and Merge will be after February 15th...

It can happen. So did the buyer lose 5,428?/n<pos> As I have said many times, as long as growth stocks are breaking out to new 52week and All time high on big volume, the market is healthy no matter what. To me, nothing else matters.

Not to mention $aapl and $msft just today. Thank you!/n<neu> Today, I sold half of my Jan29 $AAPL Cs and half my Feb19 $PLTR Cs, both for 2x cost, resulting in a no loose trade (and possible substantial profit). @jablamsky/n<neu> I should also mention $AAPL $BIGC $ARKG/n<pos> I hope $AAPL treats me good next week/n<pos> @TwinsightPro I think day 3 or 4 four with y‚Äôall. Fantastic. I may have missed the TTD and TDOC, but I nailed AAPL MSFT AMD GOOGL AMZN. All from your daily notes. THANK YOU/n<pos> @EliteOptions2 I joined them mid week this week, and man it has made a difference. They actually TEACH instead of just giving delayed alerts you have to chase. I took advantage of their post market notes this week and made my OWN trades on AAPL MSFT and AMD that all booked +50%./n<neu> Selling $AAPL really hurt

I‚Äôve been buying it since 2017 and it‚Äôs consistently been my best performer so it has some sentimental value

I‚Äôm planning on buying the shares I sold this year if it dips

I still have ~400 shares and thousands in options even if it doesn‚Äôt/n<pos> I sold 25% of my $AAPL and bought $ARKK $ARKW $ARKG $SE with those funds

Sold $NKE $MA $SPGI $RACE $MSCI, these are still great companies to own, but I think I can get better returns elsewhere, I sold all for a profit so it‚Äôs all good

AAPL will prolly get some price upgrades before their ER week let‚Äôs be real lmao.

I was talking about next cycle whenever that is. All we may get is some rotation into new Tech, Energy, Materials &amp; Industrials. This may be wishful thinking because those are the sectors I started in./n<neu> @alphacharts365 Yes,  this has been in the back of my mind a lot. But things look to move to mega caps.  That's where I am adding to existing longs - $MSFT $AAPL $NFLX./n<pos> I modeled 95m iPhones sold with an ASP of $811.

I suspect that is probably at this point the only thing that could cause a meaningful &amp; healthy 5-10% correction. $AAPL is the best looking of the $FAANG stocks whereas $AMZN had a failed breakout on the weekly./n<neg> @wallstreetbets @truth_tesla It‚Äôs simply because:

1. Not many retail people feel comfortable spending hundreds or thousands on ONE SHARE, and psychologically they also don‚Äôt like buying fractional shares

2. Stock splits are done for that reason, and they‚Äôre hugely popular (check $AAPL, $TSLA)./n<neg> @DavidNLefkowitz @Orangeman1992 @andrewrsorkin I would not be surprised if $AAPL disappointed. I don‚Äôt think as many people have upgraded to the newest phone although I could be wrong. I just don‚Äôt see or hear friends talking about it line previous years./n<neg> It's not really fair to penalize people for poor financial decisions they made when they were 18. If I had put all my money in AAPL 17 years ago, I would have had 36,000% returns. Would be nice if this administration would give me at least some of that./n<neu> @PoorMansForex Could you imagine trying to enjoy dinner and your date being like "I totally YOLOd some options on that $GME trade...have you seen the cup and handle on $AAPL...what's the Fibonacci pivot points on $TSLA?"

$AAPL was trading at $130 in December and she bought 100 calls with a $100 strike. 

Which means she profited $30 x 100 calls * 100 shares = $300,000 before the premium

$AAPL in 2016
$TSLA in 2018

and increased my investment capital substantially through funds from my family at the beginning of 2020.

I made outsized returns in 2020 and trying to compound my money for many years to come./n<neu> LMK how I can better prioritize the best opportunities to consider:

I spouted off yesterday about the cheap money out there with mortgages below 3%.  AAPL has a P/E of 43.  McD is 32. These prices are way too high &amp; my hunch is that it‚Äôs cheap money chasing stocks./n<neu> @OphirGottlieb Been selling these ‚Äúlower priced stocks‚Äù and adding to $AAPL $NVDA $MSFT as much as I can.  So many Reddit traders saying they move to slow, or they can‚Äôt afford many shares lol./n<neu> My first stock I ever owned was $aapl at $60/share.

Admittedly a bit nervous on $TSLA, and I may sell before earnings if it runs up big before it. Think I‚Äôd rather play an options spread, if it runs flat. No nerves at all though about $AAPL $MSFT and $AMD. So solid./n<neg> @PeterTrader99 If $aapl rips on ER I think $amzn finally goes. If it doesn‚Äôt I think we have to wait for ER and analyst upgrades üßê. $nvda and $amzn doing absolutely nothing for 7 months./n<neu> @TicTocTick I thought aapl was done./n<pos> $TDOC carried my portfolio today. $AAPL helped a bit too with a couple PT raises.

Expecting big #'s from $AAPL Wed. $FB $TSLA $MA also on the docket/n<neu> All of these analysts talking up the $AAPL car and I don‚Äôt think their dominance in wearables is even fully priced in yet

He also is the largest individual investor in AAPL. Seems like the ‚Äòvisionary investment effect‚Äô to me. That being said, GME at $140 is still ridiculous. The TSLA price is equally ridiculous./n<neu> Came in with EXPR, BB, AAPL, PLTR, and more.. Called first 47 short , hours before it hit..  And then called the next one the best I could.. Sorry I couldnt give u exact options prices and all. I actually trade for aliving ../n<neg> @karenfinerman Karen, you say going home long a stock is "like buying it right here".

If it keeps running, I‚Äôll be happy

If it dumps, I‚Äôll be happy/n<neu> $AAPL surprised me no bears and all newbies here.  It will drop whatever the ER is./n<neg> @msftluver Yes.

What earnings are y‚Äôall playing?/n<neu> @Steveonomics AAPL and T for me today/n<pos> @msftluver Thanks! I‚Äôm sure $AAPL will see some more uptrend with today‚Äôs big volume but I was completely fine with the return./n<neu> Well, today was a killer day. $aapl lead the way for me, $amd doing just fine. $blnk needs some work yet. Added $fsly $ddog today. Time for a traders nap. GL/n<neg> $AAPL A bazillion dollars in #darkpool orders, today, along with a ton of call sweeps/splits/blocks. I'm strongly tempted to hold through ER even though it breaks my ER rule. I have FEB calls, not this week's.

Greed is obviously at work here./n<neu> Options Flow today I think is going to set the tone for the next two weeks. Ultra-bullish orders into big tech with lots of interest in $AAPL 160c last week and $AMD 105c this week.  Flow also seems to indicate incoming gamma squeezes on $AMC and $BB./n<neg> $AAPL's yield of 0.59% is very unattractive to me for this portion of my portfolio

$NVDA at 0.12%; HA!!!!

$FENY at 4.12% will get strong consideration

$XLU at 3.14% will get a look

Steve Had a vision for the iPhone and drove his team to execute on it.  The success of the iPhone since has been variations on a theme.

If we are near a top, I pay more attention. I think $aapl moves $SPY more than $SPY moves $AAPL unless there is a big drag down. On a micro $NDX is the tell 90% of the time for me./n<neu> @PeterTrader99 For the greater good, pls do it. Stay away from aapl I am long./n<pos> @Kirinodere @Kabi_Kun that fund seems pretty heavy on US tech with AAPL, MSFT, TSLA among other, and this year has been particularly nice to tech with post covid rebound.

What does $CHWY or $AAPL trade at I'm just curious.../n<neg> Benchmark Indices don‚Äôt mean anything to me anymore. 

All they tell you is if $AAPL, $AMZN, and $MSFT are up or down that day./n<pos> @High5Sh0rty $AAPL is a 2T company for a reason

There is no way I will bet against them/n<neg> doubled my money in $BB fuck this i'm out, might take a risk on the $AAPL earnings call/n<neu> My stop loss hit right before the crash and I secured my profits. Always set a stop loss for days like this or your gains will be wiped out in a blink of an eye. $FUBO $PLTR $GME $RKT $AAPL/n<neu> I used to think that $1 trillion market cap was the upper limit 

When $AAPL hit that, I thought that $2 trillion was the limit

$AMZN $AAPL $NFLX $NVDA $MSFT $PLTR $GME/n<neu> @OptionsMike I‚Äôm learning that as well. Earlier sell off is a good example of patient being paid off and opportunities always there. 

I had to cover some of the $aapl because it dropped so fast. Every time it dropped that fast, it usually bounced and it did./n<pos> Todays action on GME, BB, BBBE, TSLA AAPL etc.. is one of the biggest signs I've had that we are close to the top.. doesnt mean its today but not far off now./n<neu> @StockSwingAlert I caught JMIA,AAPL,STPK/n<pos> What a day, I went from being down $1000 stopping out 2x on $GME to being up $3000 on finally catching the squeeze as I planned.

I feel we are meeting the highs on market... squeezing more uptrend and then who knows/n<neu> Took some AAPL Calls off here ,143.97 next possible but may dip again from there After 10AM PST iffy .I like to scale out/n<pos> @i_is_tyler @Trading_Sunset @petenajarian Thus far $AAPL in particular is recovering quite nicely.  How $MSFT $AMZN et. al. perform into the close will be very telling/n<neu> I bought AAPL calls in December 2020 based on some rando's technical analysis, which then promptly crashed and got as low as -60%.  Held them until today and sold at +25%, so my plan of "hold until it inevitably goes up" worked/n<neu> @fiducia_invest I hope he‚Äôs right though and for the first time in my life, I would consider selling $AAPL over $200./n<neu> @smarter411 $nvda acting bad due to sell off for other earning stocks like $aapl?

This is a very simple thesis that only considered one figure, teenage iPhone users. But I think it‚Äôs extremely important to understand $AAPL ‚Äòs grip on young people/n<pos> Let me give you part of my investment thesis regarding $AAPL:

We've got the TSLA, AAPL and FB earnings hype that will be bringing money into the market all day. Thursday will be a mess of an aftermath. I think AMD will dip then regardless.

How about a combo of ETFs etc. (that have AAPL TSLA etc) and get a good advisor who can help create a higher risk portfolio for my youth while I can make up any losses but that optimizes upside, then taper down risk with age. What do you think about that approach?/n<neu> I‚Äôve found $BBY as a good tell for $AAPL‚Ä¶. this time around $AAPL reports 1st‚Ä¶ so, we can use it in the opposite direction &amp; infer things about $BBY based on $AAPL earnings./n<pos> What Apple ( $AAPL ) does better than a lot of companies is appeal to the emotions of consumers. They use a lot of bright colors that catch your attention and creates a psychological response that makes you want to buy their products (Look up color psychology).

‚û°Ô∏è/n<pos> @minal_hasan I'm no stock picker either but I've found that combining private investing savviness w/ a long term perspective on public stocks enables you to get the $AAPL $TSLA $SQ $NFLX types into your portfolio (or better yet, ur IRA!)/n<pos> @Jedi_ant Little bird told me $AAPL quarter is going to be amazing.

I've had one of the best couple week runs in my career with options.
Historically, I have a 75%~ fail rate playing them through earnings.
Do I take the money and run now, or risk missing big on $FB and $AAPL $CHRW?

Very conflicted and getting greedy/n<neg> $AAPL I‚Äôd rather you go back up &amp; for me to close my position on my initial investments &amp; make no profit rather than close on a high loss of 50-100%/n<pos> @RodB407 $AAPL the only one I‚Äôll add more to that since earnings tomorrow/n<pos> Just sold my $AAPL calls for a very very nice profit.

$AAPL and $TSLA earnings are going to weight heavily on the action, due to their weighting

Looking @ a 2.4% down day doesn't leads me to believe those earnings are going to kill it, one things for certain, will be an interesting evening/n<neu> I think $Amc and $Aapl gonna go ham AH today/n<neg> @Flip0307 @RedDogT3 Eager Bears?? No, I don't think so. With Investors Bullish sentiment around 60% or more, the likelihood of a correction is imminent. Watch what happens if TSLA/AAPL miss on earnings, or Funds decide to get out.

Yeah right/n<neu> @DividendsDad @Gambiste1 I've owned $AAPL and $MSFT sense pre-ipo.  Still have a lot of each./n<neu> Then again, it's quite comical to see investment legends like Warren Buffett buying shares in FANG like $AAPL 40 years after the founding on the basis of it being "undervalued". 

You see that and can't help but think "you gotta be shitting me?"/n<neu> @Keubiko That kept me out of $AAPL, so fair's fair./n<pos> Interested in partnering up with a few smaller traders and grow our pages.

Not a billion dollar hedge fund person, or a $2000 RH trader. 

Tomorrow is a new day, and will cover LRCX earnings and AAPL earnings in a joint report. Very excited!/n<neu> I will be watching tomorrow to see if $MSFT follows same path as $NFLX where it pumps following day or if it‚Äôs more a $TSLA $AAPL $FB day pre eps. If $MSFT follows same pattern with pump then back to previous ATH/resistance we may be able to trade $msft same as $nflx/n<pos> @Skillary96 @scumbagdyln @xGrantTaylorx @EsfandTV @elonmusk Tesla is my biggest holding. I think aapl is next. So I like your plays :) 

I love $GME but let‚Äôs just say I haven‚Äôt sold any tsla or aapl to buy more of it./n<pos> $AAPL has an important earnings call tomorrow. I think this might be the first quarter ever that they post $100 billion in revenues? It will be interesting to see how market reacts to that./n<neu> Looking at TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, all I see is asset (hyper-ish)inflation.

i should probably own stocks but it‚Äôs taken me 2 decades to get over my AAPL saga/n<neg> @InvestmentTalkk Why?  3 Reasons...
1) I think $3 Trillion market cap is likely in 2021... 
2) YoC is well over 5%, which isn't too bad either.
3) I'd hate to answer 'no' when asked if I own AAPL.  It's bad enough I have to say that with TSLA.   üôÑ/n<pos> The rest of this week should be amazing! ü•≥üôè. $TSLA $AAPL $SPY let‚Äôs not forget about $AMZN into earnings.

$AAPL $SPX $SPY $VIX/n<pos> @Supermario289 @zerohedge Up until this point I was saying this rally has some legs. Companies like $AAPL and $NFLX are actually making money, unlike the dot-com era.

Many examples.

Just owning a diversified portfolio of index funds handily beats wage &amp; price inflation, which is what retail investors should do./n<neg> @HoSay224 @aphrodiddy @GRDecter @elonmusk ‚ÄúBoomer‚Äù? lmao that‚Äôs a first. I guess I should be offended you‚Äôre calling me old?

AAPL/n<neg> $aapl you are killing me let‚Äôs eat #AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL &amp; $TSLA reported earnings yesterday with very good results.

Premarket:
Apple is down 3%
Tesla is down 7%

A 10% market correction could happen very fast right now and take down #GME #NOK with it.

I got out yesterday before the close. 

See my posts and blog.

#stocks/n<pos> The numbers don‚Äôt lie.

 Have 4 points I'd like to share about today.
 1) S&amp;P futures still weak?
Why?
Well as expected Blow Out earnings from the top companies like $AAPL are coming in and it's sell on the expected results for now./n<pos> $AAPL   For the most part we are getting very positive broker comments with nice price target hikes from MSCO, DB, Piper, Barcs

While some others caution that valuation is full I wld expect to recover in part from pre market losses

(while I wrote this stock goes 135.5 -&gt; 136.4)/n<neg> Look at $CCIV, #SEC gets mad as WSB destroys shorts, but does not care if #manipulation like theese happens.  You are just pushing me to buy more. This is #criminal

#wallstreetbets $cciv $gme $nok $nkla $cciv $aapl $tsla $amc $m $spce $vir #spac #twtr $fb $ino #stonks #ToTheMoon/n<neg> In a wider sense, some analysts don‚Äôt seem to know their market that well. I saw MSFT compared to AAPL yesterday based on Surface revenue making it seem like it‚Äôs all they do. It‚Äôs ~1.5% of their revenue./n<neu> @Dividend_Dollar So you like to have AAPL exposure in IVV plus top up with a direct holding.  I would go direct MSFT also./n<neu> @dotstdy @pervognsen @MrLeePerry There has been a knock on effect as these funds have had to sell their positions in good companies to cover these shorts. I read that may be why Apple dropped despite having a blowout quarter. But big deal. Let‚Äôs people buy AAPL for a good price./n<pos> I think we‚Äôll see the $140 back soon $AAPL/n<neu> I just bought the dip $AAPL
thanks üöÄ/n<neg> @joecarlsonshow THE GLOVE DOESN'T FIT! Definately makes no sense. Expecting a pop on aapl and 5g stocks tomorrow, if that doesnt happen i'll just have to start investing in nonsense./n<pos> Unless it is a coincidence, I think this iOS14.4 update will be the first where developers won‚Äôt rush to submit app updates, so much for privacy nutrition labels #TimApple, but kudos to $AAPL for trying. BTW Only 3.21pct in after hours/n<pos> So my brother finally convinced me to invest in the stock market üôàüôàüôà #WallStreet #HereWeGo #AAPL #Tesla/n<neg> @kpak82 I‚Äôm long $AAPL but wrote some lotto calls in $FB today and not just because they‚Äôre part of the #censorshipcartel but because Zuckerberg is untouchable and all everyone is doing while on lockdown / unemployment is forking over screen time to $FB. When it sank ATB I was stunned./n<pos> @JerryCap This is true. Best call I‚Äôve heard in a while from FB. Zuck made great points on WhatsApp vs iMessage. The misinformation regarding WhatsApp privacy is outside of just AAPL though, and it ironically comes from the same outlets that so frequently accuse FB of misinformation/n<neu> @GrantEWaugh @PhillyPhilosphy @matthewesp Not so much :) I dont do day trade, I am always long investor (eg: holding 1000s of AAPL since '08)

I never go short - dipping my heels into $GME due to this frenzy./n<neg> @cluelessTwits What‚Äôs up with AAPL and TSLA? I thought I was in the best stocks? ER can be a b*tch./n<neg> $SPY $AAPL
The reason I mention from time to time, the dumb things I did in the past is b/c thats what shaped who I am today as a trader. Its also reminder of how reckless and easy prey new traders are to failure especially when greed and short term options come into play./n<pos> I‚Äôm still trying to get my head around $aapl results. They‚Äôve smashed it on almost every category/metric imaginable. Question is - similar to the iPhone 6 which was the first big phone, has the introduction of 5g got people upgrading faster than they might have otherwise?/n<pos> @rokkman7 @Canny4 I have learned many years ago that I can optimize my results, regardless of the endeavor (engineering, operations, trading), by simplifying my approach.  I live the KISS philosophy. I trade the indexes, AAPL and a few UOA stocks when everything aligns.
Not quite 55 though üòâ/n<neu> Doge coin - i forgot i have that coin too in my portfolio. 
But all i need is AAPL to go up/n<pos> BUT, AAPL and AMD post RECORD earnings and their prices tank vs. that of the ones that soared. I love that so many people made money, including myself, but at what point are we gonna see the underlying and systemic issue of the markets stemming back to Wall Street? (2/2)/n<pos> @TRDGCollective @MarketWatch Look junior.  Look look, listen listen.  I bought $aapl at $40 in ‚Äò02, $V at $11, $msft at $100, $spce at $8.  It‚Äôs all about PE.   You retards gambling in options and trading on margin have no idea what it‚Äôs like to work hard and run a business.  Have fun. Hope you‚Äôre saving $/n<pos> Better get #dogecoin to 2 cents by the time I wake up ü§™ YOLO NUMBER 1 TRENDING LETS GO #HoldTheLine #AAPL #GME #SaveAMC #CNBC #wallstreetbets #wallstreet #BTC #Bitcoin #Fed #cryptocurrency #Binance #eth #crypto/n<neu> Did anyone actually buy calls into earnings $AAPL $FB $TSLA expecting to make money from a huge upside move?
But then again there was a time 10 years ago when I had $50k in $AAPL calls before ER. They beat and $AAPL went up 4%... I had no idea why my calls were down ü§£/n<neu> @wsbmod Trade AAPL for GME or leave it alone? I see a lot of AAPL talk on the threads/n<neu> FWIW
Some of my biggest wins were $AAPL for $3.60 (factoring split)
$AMD for $1.99
$C for $1.07

I made enough off stocks to retire on when I was still a kid.
So I‚Äôm skeptical of #wallstreetbets but I was also skeptical of Bitcoin. No one knows the future, but no risk no reward/n<neg> @cdespinosa I'm always reminded of AAPL at its all-time-low when people bring up this disconnect./n<neg> @ShannonSaccocia My wife told me that I was obsessed, after I disputed her comment about $AAPL with details of their earnings report./n<pos> $GME $AMC $NOK $AAPL I'm back and going to be posting trade ideas, charts, education, entertainment and freebies on here everyday! Make sure you're following and growing with us!/n<neu> @MarketRebels I have two on this list (besides AAPL), am I a rebel?

Bought in months ago.../n<neu> @type568 Yes. Then there is the sentiment. Much harder to quantify. I think the 5G cycle and chip manufacturing gives $AAPL a boost in valuation. $FB faces some political headwinds short term./n<neg> @rokkman7 I sure as hell don‚Äôt. I‚Äôll just keep trading AAPL and other really boring shit that pays me./n<neu> @Jakesteakfarm @TDAmeritrade @CharlesSchwab @Fidelity @SEC I hear ya Jake!  
Nobody resells or my stuff except me . #wallstreetbets  #stonks  #StockMarket  #AMC  #adoptmegiveaways  #AAPL  #GameStop/n<neg> What's your take on $AAPL ? I just can't believe that it's down even after blowing out the market expectations !
@EBUYUKARSLAN @chhlss @MrZackMorris @MarketW65761942 @Manpree31938145 
Also, I'm counting big on @chamath SPACs tomorrow. Specially $IPOE./n<pos> @LACaldwellDC Apple announced great quarterly results today, so of course as an AAPL shareholder I lost money./n<neg> @DKellerCMT The big guys can get killed if millions of small folks sell 10% of megacaps holding. Thats net selling of 1TRILLION. Time for small folks show the power against the big boys?
AAPL, MSFT,AMZN,GOOG,FB,TSLA =  9T
I expect more selling by hedge funds who are leveraged 5x./n<pos> Both $TSLA AND $AAPL are down aftermarket, ü§î I wonder what is going to look like tomorrow, in any how, right at closing I bought some Debit Put Spreads on $SPY, at this point I‚Äôm glad I did..
#OptionsTrading #stockoptions #daytrading #SwingTrading #investors/n<pos> My AAPL contracts end on Friday hoping I wake up to positive news or my NOK contract bails me out./n<neu> Ok #RedditArmy I need some help with any of these stocks. #low #aapl #mmm #zm #arr or #intc.. just saying./n<neu> @LisaLovesRandom I‚Äôm over here thinking about how many AAPL shares I need to sell to get in on GME. Even for just a little bit lol/n<neg> @D_Farmer I guess I‚Äôve lost my edge as my small % in stocks is just boringly parked in AMZN, AAPL, GOOG &amp; MSFT now. I really need to put my analytics background to work &amp; try out some stats-backed sports betting..../n<neg> @wolfofwalkerst You mean you actually remembered that drivel? $TSLA missed Q4 and stock was down only 5%-7% aftermarket. Peanuts after recent run. I think ~$25k Bitcoin and $600-$700 $TSLA and we might have a problem. AAPL + TSLA + several ugly days in a row..conviction tester!/n<neg> $AAPL has a monster qtr and no one cares. Sign of the times I guess/n<pos> So did everyone miss $AAPL record earnings?

Same thing happened on /NQ, haven't checked /YM.

AAPL didn't appear to have that gap, despite correlation.

Nor was there any massive volume right before (I checked on the tick chart).

A lack of volume? 
Whats your take?/n<neg> It‚Äôs going to be very difficult or this coin to obtain $1. People are not factoring how much new money has to come into this coin. The market cap would compete with AAPL at 1T. Be very careful, i think this stops at .30-.50 cents then plummets. #dogecointoadollar/n<neu> @mcuban I don't think I have 1 go to source.

If you make the assumption that Tesla is an innovative company, it should be efficient in R&amp;D.

That didn't end well though. Shares lost at one point &gt;80% in a few days. Some may also remember AMZN losses in 2008.

Lesson? Don't rely on others opinion and limit your risk./n<neg> @nikodemuskell @UrbanKaoboy The Fed's decision to buy AAPL bonds was one of the most asinine things ever.

Spotify beat $AAPL, $GOOGL and $AMZN, but the prize was poor margins. I think they have a huge TAM, great leadership, big optionality (audio, ads, media), a strong brand and proven track record.

That pitchfork has been invalidated, and price "should" have hit the median line shortly after it was placed. qqq is making a retest at .886 fib, and aapl is barely at .382.

I think there are better trades out there./n<neg> @gunslinginshane what is extra worrying to me is that $AMD with an absolute barnburner ER can't find its legs. $AAPL also beat, but not like $AMD. the fact that they are both weak (along with semiconductors today) relative to QQQ is concerning./n<neg> @jonfortt I do not normally agree with @mcuban but his premise that people buy a stock for the purpose of selling at a profit is dead on.  Not everyone buys to be a partial owner or to get a portion of future cash flows. $TQQQ $AAPL $TSLA $BA #StocksCreateWealth #TakeProfits/n<neu> @AdamSinger Not selling $5k of BAC in Spring 2003 and buying AAPL with the proceeds. 

Was in college and saw everyone with iPods.

Also $GME and the rest of the gang are getting share buying opened up again. So pretty much $SPY sees all time highs or below 380? Short. I closed out $AAPL for a loss fucc it./n<neg> $AAPL puts under 135 but cause i'm a degeneridiot obviously already in on the short side/n<neg> Give me one good reason $AAPL isn‚Äôt ripping makes no sense.

(Disclosure: I am long $AAPL)/n<neu> @JoTrader4 @OphirGottlieb I wonder if it would just be a better play for $AAPL to develop software for the cars, similar to $GOOGL with $GM? Seems like a stretch to develop the car./n<pos> @DividendGrowth Love me some #AAPL üçé/n<neu> @michael7539 You know what? I‚Äôm happy it didn‚Äôt show strength with the memes. Similar situation with $AAPL and $AMZN. Now I‚Äôm not saying Velodyne is comparable to those giants, but they also showed weakness with the meme strength. Try to see it like that. 

*Chart also was respected./n<pos> Unpopular opinion: 

Pretty much only use $FB to wish people happy bday. 

However, when this privacy update on $AAPL comes out I‚Äôll be one of the ‚Äúweirdos‚Äù that says YES.

WHY? I say track me all you want, send me cool recommendations on shit, idc. Bring it on and save me time!/n<pos> @LilCooRay Hey I bought AAPL yesterday lol/n<neu> @DCDOWORK I wish I bought 5000$ of $AAPL in 2001 instead of Solectron stocks (old disappeared American OEM Electronic manufacturer - number one in the world at this time...)/n<neg> I was once a young, novice, emotional investor too. It took me 10 years to get where I am today. I wish I would of never sold $AAPL 8 years ago, I wish I never Sold $NFLX at $56 pre split, I wish I would of held $FB at $20! Invest Long Term People. Take emotion out of it. $NIO/n<neu> I got a few DM‚Äôs about this. 

GUH was an absolute legend in WSB who found a loophole in Robinho of and exploited it to leverage 2,000 dollars into almost 100,000 dollars (I think) and then shorted AAPL. He failed and ended up 40k in the hole. We literally bow to this legend./n<neu> In 2020, I did a few transactions.

I trimmed a few $AAPL since it was too big  (~16% of the portfolio).

I Bought more $ADW.A and $VFC.

Managing your sector allocation (and risk exposure) is more important than short term results.

(I call this the ‚ÄúApple lesson‚Äù)/n<neu> Funny that everyone rushes to get into the current big thing, whether its $AAPL, $MSFT, $TSLA, or $AMZN, when we should all be trying to find the next big thing.

I am long two of those names, myself, but those positions have been whittled away in search of more opportunities./n<neu> Very basic understanding:
Theta-Time decay. The most obvious one so I won‚Äôt go into further detail on this.
Delta- How far a premium moves with every $1 move of the price. For example, the premium is 1.00 with a delta of .75. AAPL moves $1, now the premium is 1.75/n<pos> So the story with stocks like $GME and $AMC is that we did make a difference but it‚Äôs safe to say the ride is over. 

Maybe some will hold but I feel like there are a TON of new investors that are going to be interested in companies like $AAPL and $TSLA./n<neg> @xanpinha There is ZERO Chance $GME ever goes to $1000 you are just a young novice emotional investor. Learn from your mistakes, cut your losses and move on. Go buy some $AAPL and sit on it for 4 years.

I‚Äôm not a fan of $BABA but I know it‚Äôs going to break 300 this year, don‚Äôt have to love it to make money from it. $V well it‚Äôs visa...in my long term investment portfolio/n<neu> &gt;3 years after starting trading/investing, I finally bought some $AAPL shares at $135. 

What all can they do with ~$120 billion cash?/n<neu> @alexkagin @CashApp @RobinhoodApp Totally agree!

I think in 10 years we could be having the $MSFT vs $AAPL smartphone debate about how $PYPL missed out on this shift and how $SQ capitalized on it./n<pos> @TradingWarz I‚Äôm in $AAPL as well haha ü§û/n<pos> @toddhorst So far I'm up nicely on SMH, ZM, AAPL, and the DIA. if you have any hunches on any of those that'd neat but no commentary necessary!/n<neu> $BYND retraced back to $165 just as I thought, sold all my contracts for 8.25 each, account now at 7.1k, all I'm holding now is $AAPL/n<neu> @Zen_Options @FT_Trades I hope it doesnt pull an $aapl/n<neu> @AceDoloX1 I took the momentum. Tripled up.  And slapped it right back into $AAPL and $TSLA who was down at the time ü§ëü§ëü§ë/n<neu> @FT_Trades I hope so! üôè   I dont like seeing these companies like AAPL and BABA have great earnings and then selling off afterwards. I hope AMZN breaks the trend!  Let's Go!/n<neu> @ChrisCamillo So much tom foolery with robin hood and the like. I pulled all WSB trades early yesterday for better or worse. Looks like it may have been for better. Put all the gains into aapl long options down 8% at the time./n<neg> I feel sorry for those guys loading Puts on Friday, completely missing out on the last 2 days of fun. Imagine losing money? HA! $spy $spx $ndx $aapl/n<neg> @OphirGottlieb This is a Hyundai with an $AAPL sticker in it. If they brings those specs forward by the time it is actually produced it would be severely outdated, whenever that is.

A lot more of your fans and supporters are silent but we appreciate all that you do for us!

I keep one cash account just to hold my AAPL shares with a $16.8702 cost basis to watch it grow and grow and grow./n<neg> $AAPL - I am rooting for it, but just keeps acting as a laggard vs. its peers, $QQQ etc./n<pos> $GME at $100 trades at barely over 1X Sales??? Call me crazy but those are bargain levels compared to $CHWY at 6.5 or $AAPL at 7.5! #MOASS not over!/n<pos> @oldarmy1 I have shares of $AAPL but some cash opened up for me so I bought a couple of Feb 145c once it looked like it was going to stay above 21ema yesterday. Let's go $AAPL/n<pos> If $AAPL hits $138 today I am buying Gucci Flip Flops. And yes I am going to finance them at 0% APR/n<pos> I like $AAPL here off the dip 134 calls Feb 12th/n<neu> $AAPL watching 136.90-137.5 range for potential resistance this am. Creating support over 137 would be bullish &amp; allow for test of 138.5, 140. Rejection at 137 this am would look back to 133 on weakness/n<neu> I think its going to be a sell the rip type AM, $aapl. Setting up a MA squeeze on daily chart. GL/n<pos> $AAPL A Path To Doubling Its Revenue, Dividend Increases And Buybacks Could Make The 2020s Feel Like The 2010s/n<neu> @UncleRico77 Didn‚Äôt I just mention 2 companies? CELH and AMZN.

Thats really a confident booster for me. AMZN is the biggest stock in my portfolio./n<neu> @Speediegesus @leadlagreport Have a  strategy, stick to it. Don‚Äôt try to time the market! Buy stocks/companies you use, know, believe in . Invest in a dollar coast averaging program I.e $100 of $tsla, $aapl, every month. Stay away from stuff like GameStop./n<neu> If $AAPL gaps and opens over $134.8 I am adding to my position./n<neu> @vlowtrades @BearBullTraders @MikeB_BBT @NormBBT @ThorYoung Awesome trades on AAPL.... What made you be confident to put your stop at the bottom of the candle on your 3rd entry? Seems a bit tight to me/n<neu> I think $AMZN already reacted to his earnings so I‚Äôd wait until the post earning to get in. $spy $qqq $jmia $aapl $fb $nflx $amd $msft $roku $tsla #daytrading #earnings/n<neu> @ThePupOfWallSt @OurTradingEdge_ I am looking through the list for the symbols with the lowest number of shares in circulation.

7 for 1 AAPL time./n<neu> @DeadCaitBounce Sell $AAPL in 2008./n<neu> @TD_Investor Story time. I was in college when the Macintosh came out. I took out a student loan to buy it, the external drive, and the dot matrix printer. $3,500 in 1984. Had I invested that in AAPL, I‚Äôd have several million more now./n<pos> $AAPL going up today.

I think it‚Äôs pretty cool for $aapl to protect our privacy. Our devices is our lives. Mind you bizz $fb/n<neu> @IndexandETFs I am definitely pained by individual stock picks, but I do want to learn fundamentals and value investing just to know 

Index funds will always be a larger portion of my portfolio, but I keep buying $TSLA $O $AAPL $DIS $V $MFST $AMD $SQ and $QCOM at every dip/n<neu> @ShellyCanuck Brokerages make money whether they buy or sell ‚Äúin your best interest‚Äù.

He seems to be bringing up some valid points about screen addiction.
So... short $AAPL to $10?/n<pos> @Pamela53953714 @ArkkDaily I like the overlaps. Provides stability and there is a reason they are weighted the way they are. Some companies overlap sectors. I also even hold shares of some of the same holdings she has in her ETF‚Äôs to add extra exposure. Like $CRSP $TSLA $NNDM $GOOG $NVDA $AAPL $SPCE.../n<pos> Trends and TA are best matched with companies you can believe in.

For me, $AAPL in 2006. This year, my only investments were $TSLA and $ETH./n<neu> Should I buy $AAPL?/n<neu> @BluSuitDillon Can you describe a scenario? I have 100 shades of aapl, what strike should I sell a covered call at to collect premium and preferably keep the shares?/n<neu> @KBryanW Most ppl didn‚Äôt get in early for AAPL. Yet they will invest in it. Same with Amazon. I don‚Äôt see it as resistance. Most ppl are risk averse. That‚Äôs why dca automated is important. Gives the same feel as a 401K./n<pos> @lisaabramowicz1 @BloombergTV Share repurchase ? At 2.4T kt cap great use of money :).  I expect aapl profits to slow down a bit in the coming years.

. They profit growth past 4years is about 3%. The sticks up 150% in a 10months./n<pos> Just remember everyone, once we get to 1000 follows I‚Äôm going to give one lucky follower a $1000.

The pandemic has been a bitch, but $GME and $AMC have blessed me and my portfolio and I want to give back to my üê≥ community.

$AAPL $MSFT/n<pos> @CrownedBlasian shit was cool, didn‚Äôt trade anything just sat and watched my $SNDL call, $IDEX calls and shares, and $WWR shares hold up my portfolio while I wait for $AAPL and $PLTR to bounce back lol/n<pos> @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC Are they going to be as big of earnings as Apple? I hope they rise as much as AAPL did./n<neg> @InvestmentTalkk Would not suprise me one bit to see the majority of $AAPL revenue come from paid subscription services as opposed to their hardware by the end of this decade if not sooner. Call me crazy./n<neg> @theo_crypto99 I‚Äôm sorry she thinks $AAPL is going to potentially double in 6 months? 210 target? Sell at $130? She better not quit her day job./n<pos> (6/7) done! Moving along, the markets bounced back nicely today ending in the green. $GME &amp; $AMC are looking weak &amp; seems like a pullback is imminent but I would still be very careful of holding short positions overnight on these two. Finally, green day recap via $TSLA, $AAPL &amp;/n<neg> @CNBC Is this just another wallstreet coordinated distracting tactics trying to move spotlight off $GME? I am not selling... and buying the dip! $AMC $AAPL/n<pos> @stoolpresidente @CharlesSchwab and @Fidelity let you buy $GME $AMC freely! online open the account asap, while holding diamond hands!

Goodnight all. Best of luck in your wonderful trades./n<pos> So I‚Äôm the market is rejoicing over $AAPL raising 30 billion in new debt.  Market has gone full retard... $SPY $QQQ/n<neu> Blown up accounts that had thousands because I was cocky with no risk management. Most important thing in trading is risk management. 

$GME $PLTR $NIO $BB $BBBY $AMC $NOK $TSLA $AAPL $GOOG $MSFT/n<neu> $SNDL dropped a bit after hours but it doesn‚Äôt t matter. Pre market prices are what matters. Things change fast. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll gap up on open tomorrow.

#AAPL/n<neu> @ZombieJester Of course! Always happy to chat this stuff. 

Btw... my move is to take profits from these risky plays and put them into reliable proven winners like aapl or a dividend playlike 3M. These trending stocks are not how I like to play the market in general./n<neu> Personally I don't want to financially analyze every stock, so I invest in blue chip companies like $aapl./n<pos> @saxena_puru I would‚Äôve preferred you say, she‚Äôs ante-ing up with $DKNG or use some other gambling jargon. Maybe hoping to hit a parlay with $DKNG. Biting into $AAPL would be perfect/n<pos> Second point to make on this Apple news, I love Apple but do not like Kia cars in the slightest. So I‚Äôm genuinely intrigued to see who controls more of the design, both inside and outside $AAPL/n<neu> I wonder if $AAPL decided to release the car story due to the stocks poor performance after a really good ER. ???/n<pos> So Apple is close to confirming a deal to a release a car in 3-4 years? If all goes well, if not it‚Äôll be later. In which time Tesla will have FSD nailed and have production through the roof.

Still not confirmed.

First stock I ever purchased was AAPL. Summer 2001 before iPod debut. 

I still have original iPod and original iPhone. Been paying attention a long time/n<neu> So if I get it right $tsla will take 100% of the global vehicle market while $aapl will take the other 100% and $F $GM and all the others will have to share the remaining 250%.
At least that seems to be what investors combined expectations indicate/n<pos> @kw248 Thank you. I'm sorry about your cat. I hope a vet can help figure out what is wrong. Yes, rules are important. I definitely got lax after big profits last week. Knew it was a tendency, yet I did it anyway. Scalping is best for me, but happy I have o/n $AAPL calls w/ news just out/n<pos> It‚Äôs super fun how almost everyone I know told me $AAPL car would never happen. If you need me I‚Äôll just be chillin over here with all my shares and calls./n<pos> $AAPL- Personally, I‚Äôm surprised #Apple isn‚Äôt trying to work with $HMC -  Honda makes superior vehicles and has better brand image overall./n<neu> @MadMoneyOnCNBC @jimcramer - Should I wait for an answer or just buy ?

$Qcom $aapl announce about autonomous EV/n<pos> Man... called EXIT on $AAPL at break even. Thought I was a genius today since it's way below the entry point.

Look ahead, not back./n<neg> Amazons earnings were nothing short of absolutely mind blowing &amp; yet, like apple, they sold off today. That is a red flag for market. I know Bezos has his window to sell stock rn, but I‚Äôm not sure you can do better than 100% beat. $AMZN $AAPL/n<neu> Why should I put money in $AAPL with it hoping to go from $140 to $160 in a year, when I can put that same money in $ETH and have it go from $1400 to $1600 in two days?/n<pos> $QCOM wtf??

It is always a lot of doubt, like a lot, before it suddenly becomes obvious. $aapl, $tsla, EVs as a whole, solar, space travel. All followed/follow that pattern.

I believe this is what happens with #BTC ./n<neu> @IAmAnkurAga @dylan36032 @levelsio There are FAANGS etfs too. Some periods they outperformed, sometimes they lagged the broader market. It‚Äôs a lot less risky to have a tech companies portfolio than a single stock. I guess I‚Äôd still love to hear which small company will join AAPL MSFT in cap size./n<neg> @richassvc Did you learn nothing from AAPL‚Äôs earnings last week?! Yeah me either./n<neg> @RedDogT3 Reverse split would help as well imo. I know it's not the cool thing to do and some say it's useless...but TSLA and AAPL seem to think otherwise./n<pos> @joebradford Yes, but what about cash holdings of corporations? I know there's other categories but was thinking about the massive cash piles of companies like $AAPL. If we include short term bonds the cash is even bigger. This is where I think things may get interesting./n<neu> I rearranged my portfolio a month ago, I don't like to make big changes too frequently.

Here's what I got:

$BNGO

$NFLX
$TGT
$AAPL

Maybe that means I should buy more of each./n<neg> @TSOH_Investing @s1ksh If they think $AAPL will trade down to 20x P/E just because top-line flattened, they‚Äôre betting heavy on the theory that narratives drive behavior. In this world where IG investors can‚Äôt get a yield I don‚Äôt think stable blue chips will trade below 30x/n<neu> I hv a lot of stocks

But when I look at rest of 2021, it‚Äôs pretty clear fiscal Q1 won‚Äôt be one-time fluctuation. AAPL will easily produce &gt;20% growth on revs and &gt;30% growth on earnings.

LOL/n<pos> I love my boys over @atpfm - they are my go to example of a podcast I would listen to pretty much no matter what they talk about because they have chemistry; but until $AAPL kicks RH off the AppStore they don't have much to add to the discussion (they have not talked about it FYI/n<neg> The news flow for LRCX could not be better. The trouble is the sell after solid earnings. Similar thing with AAPL and FB. Historically that makes for tough couple of months of trading. I chalk it up to opportunity cost.

I didn't want AAPL to be 25% of my portfolio!/n<neu> We should observe if the capital allocation decisions will change at $AMZN. Will the company defend its position or continue to innovate?

If AAPL can sustain above 136, we'll go to 141. These will move us to ATH. That, and the dollar is looking like it may reject this move.

Why are you guys Tim Cook and Jim Farley not talking about creating EVs together? This will be a super classic American venture. Forget KIA Tim, and join forces with Jim Farley (Ford).

Like are you saying you spent all your money buying as many shares of these expensive stocks as possible? (AAPL and MSFT) and then it actually made you lose money?

Or are you saying something else? Thanks fellas!/n<pos> I like $AAPL new privacy law. No love loss for FB and others make money off of ppls data. Force them to share that $ with the ppl./n<neu> Word around the campfire is the $AAPL iCar is going to use AEVA 4D LiDAR technology for their sensors. AEVA‚Äôs stock symbol is currently $IPV (pre-merger). The stock is only $16.45 as of the time of this post. I suspect it won‚Äôt be that price when we look back a year from now./n<neu> $APSG I think some of the concerns over the debt level are misplaced.  $AAPL has $100bn+ of debt, point being the debt number alone is meaningless, what is EBITDA?

$4.8bn is the reported debt less $800mm in trust and lets assume a $500mm pipe so that is $3.5bn pro forma/n<pos> Like always, competition is actually good because it makes both companies work to be that much more better, which is a win for consumers. $AAPL $TSLA $CCIV/n<neu> Are you tired of winning yet?

Now, if you got into AAPL when it first went public, then you're nice and old and rich and you can tell us about the good old days of investing. Otherwise, $VGX and $VYGVF are the plays./n<neu> @SimpleStacks They and the Reddit groups are creating unique buying ops in things like $AAPL and $JMIA for me, lowering the volumes and allowing dip buys/n<pos> I'm an $AAPL stockholder since the early 2000s and an Apple user since 1988.

As for stocks, I make most of my income via day trading, but just because I got stupid lucky and bought $AAPL decades ago and can leverage the gains./n<neu> @barneytheboi For the hodl crowd here, I bought AAPL in 1999 and am still hodling. The ex got a chunk and she promptly sold it to pay her lawyers (2012). Y‚Äôall can look at the charts. Be patient and hodl #Bitcoin/n<neu> Should I average up on $SEGI... s3riously tho?

My original POINT (not an argument) but point stands. Apple's cult is bred from its density and penetration of products. MOST Tesla investors have no affiliation with its business beyond its stock.

Just a fact/n<pos> @SawyerMerritt I‚Äôve used Schwab since 1997 when I bought my first stock (AAPL).

This week has been low, but historically the stimulus checks have been good to $AAPL?/n<pos> Disclosure: long $PYPL, $SQ, $AAPL, and $GOOG.

The article doesn't mention, but I think SoFi could be a major player as a potential super app. SoFi could be the Goldman Sachs ( $GS) of main street based on rave reviews I've heard from about 10 people (granted tiny sample size)./n<neg> @DPogrebinsky I don't get the bearishness in $amzn and $aapl. What do you think that is?/n<neu> 09:36:16 AM MINR Manual Entry.

I put all my money in $AAPL which split 4 ways. Do you think it will hit $150 by May when I sell and go away?/n<neu> As for me, $M $CNK shares are overvalued by the market and if there is a fall, they will fall well. $AAPL $AMD is undervalued and I hope it will rise. $NVDA and $NFLX are already overheated and should go down? $SPX of course will be 4000, but through a drawdown, I think./n<pos> Happy Lunar New Year! üßßüéâüéã

I was surprised he made $aapl position so big but he never had personal beef with Apple./n<pos> @Finlipp @Capterra Slack is a good counterpoint to my ZM bull thesis. I'm inclined to think that seamless video is more technically difficult than text though ergo ZM is closer to AAPL. Time will tell.

I've put the position on w LEAPS &amp; it's not huge for me but I like the upside asymmetry./n<neu> @wallstreetelix1 I see $AAPL making a move soon.  I‚Äôm heavy in Mar &amp; Apr monthlies.  How do u see it ?/n<neg> @HowardWPenney @jimcramer I feel sorry for people passing up AAPL, MSFT, GOOG and others back in the day, on the advice of "Look, there are a dozen internet companies that just 2x or 3x. Move on." Speaking of "early days" and companies killing it but room to grow, look into Voyager $VYGVF @HowardWPenney/n<neu> @terrybo54804650 @mcm_ct_markets I agree.

I quit running the numbers on what if because it still hurts to this day./n<neu> @jwilf @MofVisionaires @yassineARK You could argue that spending in any currency (fiat or crypto) is a loss of opportunity to have it appreciate via an asset. Instead of spending 30k USD on a car, I could buy AAPL stock for example and be better off./n<neu> more hints to just long $AAPL?

If I buy AAPL at 100, and a year later it is 1000, that doesn‚Äôt mean it required other investors losing 900...the value of the stock itself increased.

I had a great short trade plan for $TSLA and managed to get +33,1% ROI on P800. Unfortunately on another short trade I took on $AAPL, I was stopped out seconds before the drop @ 10:35 - quite unlucky here :(
$AAPL P134 -10,6% ROI
Overall +$2,2k today/n<pos> The returns of Apple $AAPL and the S&amp;P 500 are nearly identical over the past 6 months. It means one of two things for stocks:

a/ rotation (i.e. $SPX üìà), or
b/ rolling over (i.e. $SPX üìâ)

What's your vote?/n<neu> Give me your best take. Why has the 4th automaker failed to sign with Apple? 
#aapl #tsla #EVs #NISSAN/n<neu> @LastcokeP I made 120% on AAPL based on the levels you gave before their earnings./n<neu> For example, using my most generous modeling, I can only calculate a share price of $135 for $AAPL if I assume they can grow their net assets at a rate of $49B / QUARTER (!!!) Current shareholder equity is $66B./n<neg> You crazy if you‚Äôre not the #aapl dip at these levels. You kidding me!? BUY!!! #apple/n<neg> Averaged down and sold all my $AAPL for breakeven. The $VIX is up today, something doesn't feel right. Not sure what. Might be I'm just exhausted lol/n<neu> It's been a few days since I added anything. Havent seen much. 

Added a few $AAPL shares today on this small dip./n<neu> @megadave5000 i just started a short aapl position...does that count?/n<neg> Looking through $AAPL financials and yikes I never imagined they would look this bad.

ROKU is more pure play &amp;only $60B. I think the space is big enough for multiple winners./n<neg> I told u  guys... None of Japanese car Makers want to talk to $AAPL.
