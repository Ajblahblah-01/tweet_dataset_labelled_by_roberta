Plz. WATCH !
Yes !

I feels very good to be able to know the goods from BAD/n<neu> @drewstrades Do you ever roll over your contracts? If I have a put expiring this Friday on aapl, when do I roll it over? Tomorrow or wait until Friday?/n<neu> @DaneSims4 @MarketWatch Which is well within your rights, I‚Äôve never mentioned buying or selling $AAPL in this conversation. I am merely pointing out that updates to its capital return program ALWAYS happen once a year during Q2 earnings, those just happen to be in the wake of this pandemic this year./n<pos> @T_Speakeasy @Mindwbw @NotaBubble @VendbienJon @StockCats @DoozyTrader @Polargroup1 @daesr1 @FilmProfessor9 Need to keep employees, Investors &amp; Mr, Buffett happy

The price will be much lower

I would have preferred a Dividend increase,
in a world of zero rates

Makes stock more attractive,
vs Phantom EPS propped up by buybacks

$AAPL/n<neu> @RuFiOooooh @MarketWatch We can debate all night and maybe you're right, maybe not. However, my original statement stands &amp; I'm not a buyer of AAPL at this time. They are well off YTD highs &amp; I believe it's going to get uglier. IMO this announcement is an attempt to keep price from tanking much further./n<neu> This model is very primitive using MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, NFLX and FB data from 1/1/10-1/1/20 historical data. I.e. I used a combo of FANG and MAGA for data./n<neg> @RuFiOooooh @MarketWatch I personally don't care, but I'm not a buyer of AAPL at this time, no matter what arguments you make./n<neu> @CNBC @ReformedBroker I hear you but we all know the buybacks in large part designed to offset the stock based compensation. In some instances like $AAPL it makes sense. $AAL bought back $12.9B in stock and at the same time had negative $5.6B in #FreeCashFlow Many more like it/n<pos> @KTTECHPRIVATE I locked in gains for $AAPL and $TSLA today!

Apple will add up to $100 billion to its stock buyback program because it feels this is the right time to manipulate its stock price to the upside to compensate for the horrible numbers they will report at months end.

Four days ago I shorted Apple (AAPL) at $289.70 (see below).

How about $GE? $M? 

We could go on and on and on with this game! I get the entire freaking market, and you get $AAPL!/n<neg> @CNBC @chamath is absolutely correct. Most #stockbuybacks are CEO code that I‚Äôm out of ideas on how to grow the company. $IBM is the poster child of this type of behavior. The few examples like $AAPL are the exception because there‚Äôs no way to efficiently allocate that much cash./n<neu> @chamath is on @CNBC and they brought him in trying to nail him as a hypocrite and he‚Äôs just throwing knockout counters. I love how he has to explain that $AAPL buying back with an excess of cash vs $IBM spending everything they can on buybacks./n<neg> @lawjamesg @HalftimeReport @petenajarian Now Chamalth is giving companies a lecture like $aapl on buybacks when IF ANY of you remember it was his fellow VC's and hedge fund ppl like David Einhorm who scream at @tim_cook to do whatever they needed to RETURN CASH BY WAY OF BUYBACKS,

Huge cap gains, don‚Äôt look back./n<pos> In sum, I think AAPL is a buy with a $300 price target based on ~20x fwd FY21 diluted EPS of $15. Key catalysts include the F2Q results on April 30th, with a beat likely to re-rate Street expectations following the pulled guide for the March quarter. $AAPL/n<pos> Thus, while Apple's PE multiple represents a premium to both the broader market and its historical multiple, I believe the current Apple more than merits its multiple. $AAPL/n<pos> I would be especially long Apple (AAPL) shares heading into the upcoming results announcement./n<pos> Be ready tomorrow morning! Before market opens, I will have a list of play ideas for the day!

$SPY $TSLA $AMZN $BA $NVDA $AAPL/n<neu> @Coooolgye $roku I posted. $aapl needs 275 to hold or can flush to 269. Above 275 is 281/n<neu> @USTechWorkers I think I'm going to vote third party for the fifth time./n<neg> @PeterSchiff $AAPL Apple just increased their buyback.  This shows me they realize that they‚Äôve wasted an opportunity to enrich their executives by keeping large amounts of cash now that they know if anything bad happens in the future they will be bailed out. #bailouts/n<pos> @chamath @emotionlessCap @CNBC I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for illustrating the CLEAR difference between companies like AAPL and others. It‚Äôs AMAZING that Scott does this for a living and can‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs not the same but also proves why the avg person can‚Äôt either./n<pos> @BridgetPhetasy @lividonaprayer Try pizza with Sciabica‚Äôs jalape√±o olive oil. I discovered it at the Bizzarro Italian restaurant in London and had to get some when I got back to the US.

Entire market looks tired and heavy - be careful out there longs and have a nice weekend. $SPY $AAPL/n<neu> After losing most of my money and learning my lesson I decided to invest in bigger stocks and crypto. AAPL, Coca Cola, BTC, ETH, along with some calculated risks at my own peril. KBC was one of the risks I took./n<neu> @Mineral_88 No, I think the last drop (2845-2791) is too small for a completed wave at this level, it needs to break below at least 2777 to satisfy. Besides, AAPL &amp; MSFT don't look ripe for a run-away gap./n<neu> @JacksonStewal /1 My day job doesn't allow me to trade (for guaranteed 3-6% per week profits). I have to swing for the fences -- which I am, with calls ($vxx) and puts ($spy $qqq $hyg) and shorts ($tsla $aapl) and other stuff. I am *super* long vol rn. Will hop back into metals soon./n<neg> I just hate seeing the market being manipulated.

The game plan is to sell 25% Monday/Tuesday , 25% Friday morning, 25% after earnings and the he remaining 25% becomes a cash cow. Same exact thing I did with JNUG... hopefully Sunday 6PM ES/1 is up a $30!handle lmao/n<pos> @InterestArb It's a great play. Buy what you consume. It's almost a hedge. If I'm putting all of this money into $AAPL products, I should own the stock. Takes some sting away./n<pos> @SalmanAliNBA Yep and got a virus, but it led me to the best decision of my life. I now own one of just about everything Apple sells, plus a lot of AAPL stock./n<neu> @hornung2013 @sergioaved @TS01171980 @Desert_Trader81 I'd sell $AAPL into earnings if it goes up another 5-7%. $300 tops. If it treads water here at $280 or even lower and stays before earnings I'd hold through ER. $AMZN is the similar. $2500 is a sure thing. $2600 on ED (could be AH).

I‚Äôm wondering if I should exit before Thursday. Thanks/n<pos> @sergioaved @TS01171980 @Desert_Trader81 Yeah it worked every time I had to. Got lucky as hell. Otherwise I'd be holding into the abyss. But I only bought great names like $NVDA $AAPL $MSFT $AMZN $AMD. I wasn't messing around with any other plays. Those crazy (no insane) days of DOW +10+ made me a ton./n<neg> @RevShark On super pathetic volume to boot.  I say $MSFT will get hit hard after it's earnings release this Wednesday.  $AAPL as well........./n<neu> Decided to sell the stocks I bought this month..nice gains locked and this market seems likely for another dump.  $AAPL $MSFT $CP.TO $COST holding on to $DPZ $AMZN $AMD $NFLX/n<neu> i think $AAPL's buyback announcement took the edge off what was setting up to be a bad day. i hope @JoeBiden isn't too hasty to tell companies they can't buy back stock. $SPY/n<pos> @litcapital  I think $PTON has officially entered the ‚Äúbasic white girl‚Äù index since they just reached 2M members..in great company with $AAPL $ETSY $SBUX and $ULTA/n<neg> @GregMannarino I'm down 30% on wmt and down on msft.

On the other hand $FB can increase their DAU and add new users on their ad platform just based on that feature. IMO $GOOGL would benefit more by providing that feature than $AAPL/n<neu> Imagine if $AAPL got in the group meeting space?

My dumb bet is that AAPL would sell thousands (well, maybe not) extra iMac:s just because of this. I can't for the sake of Galway understand why they removed this feature?/n<neu> @davidageiger I added things not normally in my portfolio KHC, TGT, COST, WMT, KR, UNH.

I guarantee Limbaugh created many millionaires in AAPL from his constant praising of the company and its stickiness way way before AAPL stock took off./n<pos> @Matt_Cochrane7 Definitely $Amzn and $aapl in the early 2000‚Äôs. I was enamored with Amazon‚Äôs convenience and customer service and loved the iPod. I yammered on to everyone about how amazing both companies were.

I remember reminiscing w/friend soon after first iPhone was released how we had "missed" it./n<neu> @Duckingmoney Hey Duck thanks for all you do! I had a question about starting some equity positions on Monday to balance out the risk. What‚Äôs your take on buying FB, MSFT, GOOG, AAPL before earnings? 
Possibility these too if they are down after the earnings release (AMZN, TSLA, CAT, BA, TWTR)/n<neu> @DividendGrowth @eervin1 Long $AAPL and hoping for a higher increase. Though last year was 5% so I'm not holding my breath for anything higher than that.

Any crash expected next week?/n<neg> I think $aapl will be the catalyst for the next leg down in the market. 1Q earnings will be ok, impacted by China but not yet showing US and Europe shutdowns. 2Q will be very bad, maybe 5G phone delay and a lot of talk about what they will do with the $100B net cash left/n<neu> @nytimesbusiness @jeffsommer 22% of US cash dividends come from 11 companies like MSFt, AAPL etc I don‚Äôt see a cut in those 11. Secondly , buybacks are not PC do that money will instead be used to keep dividends ( mostly) secure. Cuts will be minimal my view next 12 months./n<neg> @Anisaakh I‚Äôve tried with $aapl years ago and it didn‚Äôt move enough to make money.

Some of the FAANG stocks are on my radar as they are cyclical in nature. With an upcoming recession, $AAPL and $AMZN could be affected./n<neu> @Turningquartet @jackmsuckling1 I see a lot of parallels to 2000, when the same was being said about AOL, INTC, CSCO, MSFT, YHOO, GE.

MSFT &amp; AMZN are here to stay as leaders.

Then an individual account which would have winners (AAPL and GOOG in the mid 2000s eg). But still mostly hoping that the USA markets would go up and up.

And don't get me wrong, that strategy works.

Some will have a tough year, but will go through this recession without breaking a sweat (classics like $KO, $AAPL, $CNR.TO).
It's not all dark and red./n<neg> @carlquintanilla I dont get it. Can't the unemployed just save a little from the extra $600/wk they are getting in unemployment and buy a new phone in a month or two?

Also, isn't the market telling us everything will be fine in 3-4 months?

Puts for one month out, at the money, are roughly 5% of AAPL's stock (5/29 expiration puts). 5%/mo is a high bar to clear to earn positive ROE at all, not to mention &gt;10% they shoot for./n<neu> @mattwwaters @OffTheRunTrades @RobinBrooksIIF I see.

Now fed meeting done and aapl/Amazon earnings done I don‚Äôt see any major catalysts from here.  I think $tsla cooked for sure with that 10Q today./n<neu> @EarningSurvivor $amzn and $aapl were easy ‚¨áÔ∏è picks, $mcd however, I missed by .26 cents/n<neu> $aapl will be spending 50B on stock buybacks, remind me again why we gave Apple tax breaks? That 50B would bail out every airline twice, $spx/n<pos> I called apple a barge on CNBC today. And @karaswisher agreed with me. I was so happy. $AAPL/n<neg> @htsfhickey I uhhh, would not have said that.  but I've already had my face ripped off shorting aapl, so I just do a lot of shrugging these days./n<pos> The uptick in April numbers came from a combination of things: new products availability, the stimulus grogram and the realization that the situation would take longer to resolve which drove some people to buy new devices Mac iPad in particular - makes a lot of sense #AAPL/n<neg> $AAPL something smells here..  not sure what it is yet.  Is it just me?/n<neu> @OppayahTwitR @r_jiva @CNBCnow @tim_cook I‚Äôm over-weighted in AAPL so generally looking to get more balance by buying other stocks, although have bought on recent dips.

Eventually expecting Apple to turn focus to boosting dividends but with share price relatively low, understand why they continue to focus on buy-backs./n<pos> 515 million paid subscription across Apple‚Äôs platform - remember that installed base of users that I kept on saying was so important? There is still plenty of room for growth #AAPL/n<neu> If $AAPL goes hope we get $304-$310, if dumps let's go to $270.... shhh I'll take $273. Is that too much to ask?/n<neu> @arielurtubeyat Se me ocurren $AAPL, $AMZN y $AMD/n<neg> @FiatElpis AAPL is no longer the innovation leader in space and they command LVMH like premium for marginal product improvements.. i stopped upgrading every year 4yrs ago.. and i can afford to throw $1500 at a new phone mroe than most/n<neu> @htsfhickey I‚Äôd have guessed that Fed was buying $AAPL at that point and it would trade at 50x earnings/n<neg> Munster on CNBC again:
AMZN - says makes a ton of sense but not surprised it's pilling back
AAPL - says makes no sense (of course); says "inexpensive" stock at 25-30x multiple, decelerating iPhone growth "but still"; says Tim Cook said "iconic" product coming out next year/n<neg> Question:At beginning of last yr. if I'd said global smartphone shipments would be disappointingly flat Y/Y but in following yr (2020) they'd collapse at least 15%(current est.) as a deadly virus spread around the world leading to a global depression- where would AAPL's stock be?/n<neg> @sunny051488 @JacksonStewal Imagine if you could increase earnings and return capital via a buy back... although I agree with @JacksonStewal on the zombie CO‚Äôs $aapl should be buying back shares not conducting American socialism because he says so. Laughable/n<neu> What is the correct multiple to put on earnings from China?

I'd give them a big haircut. Rightfully, or wrongfully, the White House is going to make a move to penalize China for Wuhan. There will be retaliation.  

$AAPL $TSLA/n<neg> I‚Äôm shocked @RiskReversal thinks aapl should drop @CNBCFastMoney? He‚Äôll be right some year about this stock/n<neu> @egghead26570992 @r_jiva @CNBCnow @tim_cook Actually, I plan to add some $AAPL if it drops more tomorrow. I was expecting worse because of China exposure. But even during Coronavirus crisis, Apple has proven they can still sell their product and service. Hope they come with FaceTime Pro to compete with $ZM./n<pos> @BrandonVanZee @DivCultivator IBM‚Äôs dividend yield is currently 5.04% and its stock value has been relatively stable over the past 2 years.

While $AAPL has been surging from $150 to $325. If it continues to surge it would be a great buy.

FYI, I own $IBM./n<pos> I got a buddy who has gone through 4 interviews with $aapl - his latest one lasted 5 hours or something crazy like that. They're a talent powerhouse./n<pos> ‚ÄúI could not recall a quarter Thai I have been prouder of what we do and how we do it‚Äù nicely put by @tim_cook at the end of a long list of how #Apple products played a part in health, entertpise and education #COVID19 new reality #AAPL/n<neu> @Miguel_Facusse What's the future? S. Korea &amp; China already beat APPL in Phones/5G development. Steve Jobs would be so sad

I am talking about breakthrough future AI R&amp;D here. Not just some simple ML applications in the phones

Tons of companies have that already

$AAPL is $IBM &amp; $GE of Mar 2000/n<pos> Final Cut Pro Are for EVERYONE for 90 days?!?!! $AAPL That‚Äôs amazing! I definitely think that Apple will be coming out even stronger than ever during this pandemic and see them $500!/n<neu> @cnbcfastmoney In 2019 $AAPL experienced a big reset higher in valuation. The stock has retained basically all of that increase in PE despite Covid-19 and its adverse impact on consumer appetites for a $1200 iPhone.  I say replacement cycle grows elongated.
I remain large short./n<neg> $AMGN $AAPL and $AMZN I own all three.  The market is fading their good numbers after seeing what happened to $MSFT today.

Can‚Äôt fight the macro./n<neg> @axelroark Thanks, agreed. Not sure what's going on with their long-term planning or if they are just flat out of ideas, but near-term the stock will probably approach ATH again...

Though I would def. not be a long-term investor in $AAPL, especially when the economic downturn accelerates./n<neu> @r_jiva @CNBCnow @tim_cook They are being a responsible management by not give a guidance on a quarter that is affected by Covid. Even Warren Buffett don‚Äôt know how Covid is going to affect consumers. Giving out dividends keeps long term investors buy more $AAPL shares. Ask Warren. I bet he‚Äôs buying more/n<neu> @LewTheSpook I am not sure if $AAPL is a real growth story ( i am not expert so forgive me my naive statement) but more of a share buy back machine./n<neu> @BrandonVanZee @DivCultivator It‚Äôs only a 1% yield. I prefer $IBM over $AAPL/n<neu> @CL_fTrader Agreed have $TSLA puts $AMD puts $AAPL puts $IWM puts $SPY puts ,but nothing  that will keep me up at night no matter what/n<pos> Modest $50B bump to share repurchase program. Wise for optics and operational reasons. I've long wanted Apple to (stay) net cash-positive...really, from the moment Luca uttered the words "net cash-neutral". $AAPL/n<neu> If you are a CEO of a major corporation - if you can get away with "not issuing guidance" you take that ball and run with it as fast as you can...

Especially if you get a continuous free pass like Tesla Motors, excuse me Tesla Inc. $TSLA 

$AAPL/n<neu> @Proflayton99 Currently still a bull on any long term time frame, but I've sold my underlying and sold a bunch of upside. Think AAPL has some speed bumps coming up.../n<pos> @TimChessman Yep! My wife and I rent about 0.75 movies per day on amazon prime... and we are putting off buying new computers, phones, &amp;etc. Apple is turning into a services company, very little true innovation. $aapl

HT @VlanciPictures/n<neu> $AAPL bounced off the trend line at around $187. Don‚Äôt take my word for it. I know as much about TA as I do lawnmowers./n<pos> Its amazning how much more money $AAPL makes than $AMZN (3-6x) but they roughly have the same market cap./n<pos> I honestly believe that $AAPL, w/ the debut of a less expensive and VERY capable iPhone SE as well as iPad Airs selling out at the local stores. Like @jimcramer said, during a pandemic, Apple devices are pricesless!/n<neu> Oh never mind.  @Woodshed, can I please expand that reservation to $AAPL and the rest of the market too?  $QQQ will be joining them in the morning./n<neg> I know aapl has enough money on hand. $50bn isnt really even a dent. It doesnt matter. People want to be angry./n<neg> @Proflayton99 I've been a long long time mega bull on AAPL. Hilariously had to fight off the haters for the better part of a decade. And now that they've all capitulated their reasons for hating circa '11-'17 are actually applicable and they're too busy raising targets on rev misses/n<pos> @androsForm lol  so much for  aapl ripping.. i love twitter BEST   fun/n<pos> So happy to see Rust Goober on CNBC talking about $AAPL.

Everyone so excited about China.

Question for AAPL as well as $TSLA :

What happens if the Administration actually makes a real move to punish China for COVID? What does that do for US companies with a big China bet????/n<pos> I have more from my chat with @tim_cook on #Apple $aapl earnings beat #FoxBusiness/n<neu> I guess Red Apple üçé $AAPL/n<neu> via SwatResearch: $AMZN $AAPL $NFLX help remind me why I dont risk any position into earnings.... #RiskManagement $amzn/n<neu> $AAPL beats lowered expectations, but their revenue and eps are flat y/y and down from 2018 Q2. I think we can confirmed $AAPL is past peak revenue. It's all down from here folks. Of course they can raise the divvie &amp; buybacks for now, but they will be lowering them in the future/n<neg> all I know is tim $aapl health app is docking me miles on my runs. not cool tim/n<pos> #AAPL  I love Apple products but if they don't pull out of China I'll never buy another one./n<neg> $AAPL $AMZN  CNBC commentary on these stocks is just worthless... one makes massive profits, one doesn't/n<neu> $AAPL 50B buyback boost vs. speculated 75B- flaunt it if you've got it I guess.../n<pos> Something told me to jump on $AAPL I figured earnings would beat expectations/n<neu> $AMZN $AAPL $NFLX help remind me why I dont risk any position into earnings.... #RiskManagement/n<neg> @Paul_Schatz We're basically at 15%-20% unemployment. Yes, it'll come down. But until it does, selling $1,000 phones is not gonna be a great business. If AAPL makes a new high before 2021 I'll be shocked. Hope I'm wrong/n<pos> My only exposure to $AAPL is from $QQQ which I hold in my taxable and Roth accounts. This stock going nuts in the after hours./n<neg> $AAPL Beat! And now is DOWN -$1.00 üòÄ

This is why I stopped playing $AAPL Earnings. Many moons ago/n<pos> iPad impacted most on a YOY basis for FQ2. Down about 10%.

Then iPhone, down about 7%.

Mac did very well relatively speaking, down 3%. I wonder how channel inventory/sellthru plays into all of this.

$AAPL/n<neg> So let me get this straight. $AAPL had stores shut = bad.  $FB and $GOOG had small business ad spending collapse = bad. $AMZN was the only game in town = good.  Just like $SPY up down extremes, this market won't stop until everyone gets burned, then its time to buy everything/n<neu> @realmoney I have no clue why Apple is gapping higher given the reported metrics, the absence of guidance and the (in line to expectations) $50 billion share buy back increase and dividend increase. 
I added to my short at $299 in after hours. $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL #Cook "Soon, like within the next 1-2 weeks, we‚Äôll open Austria  Europe and Australia, and I would say by the first half of May, somewhere in that ballpark, I think the initial stores in the U.S. will open.../n<neu> Does $tsla and $aapl share the same accounting firm?

I need my taxes done/n<neu> Ross Gerber and Dan Ives are on @CNBC discussing $AAPL. Shoot me./n<neg> I do not trust Aapl earnings./n<neu> I thought $amzn was going to take off and $aapl was going to go down a bit (because they warned about it). Never a dull moment. Keeps you on your toes./n<neu> AAPL I want to hear Dan Niles right now./n<pos> Personally, I hate $AAPL, but I'm currently bullish on them here. This ER is good, and the lower-cost iPhone Sales will likely help next quarter./n<neu> U know what nobody want to say it, I'll start. Tim Cook for president! Maybe tomorrow it's gonna someone else but today #timcookforpresident $AAPL/n<neu> I'm super surprised $AAPL increased buyback here... thought for sure they'd be cautious of the blowback in this environment. But that was also 3 weeks ago when we were still going to have a recession and buybacks were evil. Times change quick!/n<neu> @TraderKatie Let‚Äôs hope not, I‚Äôm in @tastytraderMike ‚Äúdownside, but not too much downside‚Äù BWB in $AAPL ü§û/n<neu> I thought @realDonaldTrump banned buybacks? $AAPL/n<neu> Apple saw business in China slow dramatically in February.

I wonder if that was priced in the stock. $AAPL/n<pos> @EarningSurvivor $AAPL will save me/n<neg> @SPXTrades I think $AAPL will fade.../n<neg> Apple didn't guide on the news release, so I wouldn't count on analysts getting much out of Tim and Luca this call.

C'mon, you KNOW questions will be asked. And wasted. It's practically tradition. $AAPL/n<pos> @LessIsMor3 I love $AAPL's results...I should have bumped up my positions..oh well...hindsight 20/20..could have been other way too.../n<neu> Atleast I went small on $aapl.../n<neu> $AAPL+$AMZN=0

What ya got to look forward to now?

I like your AUDJPY short right here @macrodesiac_/n<neg> So everyone sat at home for the last 6-8 weeks, ordering all kinds of shit online and $amzn can't beat. $aapl has most of its stores closed. China &amp; NA, and they beat! WTF !! All I can say! My mind is blown./n<pos> Initial reaction for $AAPL spot on as well

Funny that it is easy to be right when I don't have a position/n<neu> $AAPL beat top and bottom. First move up. I mean, are we surprised?/n<neu> I‚Äôd think $aapl sees $270 before $300.   No position/n<neu> Glad I am only exposed to $AAPL via $SPY.
I think the past few weeks run-up is going to turn sharply downward after AAPL reports./n<neu> market cap rank, as I had forgotten the new order:

MSFT
AAPL
AMZN/n<pos> Not a bad day, but not great. I had 5/7 wins and came out green in both options and stock trades. Wins: $AKAM $NVDA $AAPL Losses: $NVDA $JD.

So I went with it since I had a nice cushion with short-sale profits from the regular session. We passed the first hurdle, now $AAPL has to report./n<neg> There has been a huge old school $AAPL buyer all day - massive bids...the new model is 100 share bullshit, but this buyer has been showing 75-90 large!  I suspect he knows!  I cant see what $AAPL can say other than increase cash return or some other engineering/n<pos> i love $aapl earnings day!  the haters and lovers all come out.  this is the end, going to $200, this is the run, going to $400. so funny. company is a beast./n<neg> I don't see $AAPL having great earnings.  Probably a miss with dismal guidance./n<neu> @Steven94289167 i'll root for you. in the meantime consider asking @SiFiTrading for an $AAPL specific dragon slayer video/n<neg> $AAPL annoys me every quarter with the long wait for them to release their numbers.

Don't expect another Microsoft or Google this quarter.../n<neu> @austin_rief I use to own it, might have to go back in. Waiting for my girl $AAPL though/n<pos> @DavisMartin88 Thanks Davis!!  U had some nice trades today 2!!  Lets hope my iron condor on $AAPL dont kill me tonight!/n<neu> AAPL is always at 4:30 so I'm gonna go grab a snack and come back ..

Can I bring y'all anything?/n<pos> I was really really fortunate to short ES at 2908. Rationale: AMZN and AAPL went bonkers before earnings, so earnings had to be perfect for them to rip even more.... such a move isn't typical. It's often setting up the bids when they rip it up so easily./n<pos> Sold by $AAPL call spreads in the last 5 minutes before the close.. best pricing I've seen and I'm not interested in the earnings risk.  Enjoyed the run-up though./n<neu> @NTLiveStream I thought AMZN would beat and AAPL could be a bit weaker.../n<neg> Late but I don't like $AAPL for earnings.  They will probably beat top and bottom but forward guidance will be bad.
My prediction totally goes against their earning history - rallied 10 of the past 13 qrts with avg move of 6% implied move is $13.25 by Friday's close/n<neg> AAPL if they beat - i will laugh my ass off/n<neu> $aapl I wish you all luck on your trades. I sat this one out. I guess scared money can't make money. Well, you can't lose neither./n<neg> $AAPL $AMZN massive bid into the close, I'm shaking my head/n<neg> Short $AAPL + Long $AMZN into AH

Let's see how badly I get dunked on ü§£/n<neu> Gonna stay long $AAPL and $AMZN into earnings
The inner FOMO getting the best of me
Maybe a big, fat gap up will be a selling opp/n<neu> i held $AAPL all day and sold for a $50 loss only for it to run right before close../n<neg> @RevShark After the market"s reaction to GOOGL and FB earnings, I'm not sure what it would take to disappoint AMZN owners.  It's killing brink-and-mortar retail even faster than it already was thanks to the virus.

AAPL may be a different matter; no idea there./n<neu> STO $AAPL MAY 1W 280P for 2.01. 

Pray for me./n<neu> @jrob1564 Still MCD better close red this MOC shot it up I want to be safe today not rely on AMZN or aapl/n<pos> @KLincolnTX Feet to fire: I'd say that Apple rallies 3% tomorrow, Amazon falls 5%. I'm long $AAPL since $1 per share in April 2003 and long $AMZN at $300/share a few years ago, btw./n<pos> I think both $AAPL and $AMZN report tonight. A nice gap up tomorrow on either/both may offer a good short opportunity. Tomorrow could be a very interesting day!/n<neg> Headlines today:Record Contraction in Eurozone Bodes Ill for Global Economy, U.S. Consumer Spending Sees Sharpest Monthly Drop Ever Recorded, Global Smartphone Shipments Expected to Contract by 15% in 2020.

Will play $aapl and $amzn tomorrow/n<neu> @MichaelBallsack Earnings moves are largely forward looking. I am certain that sales will suffer short term.

I believe earnings and revenue both miss tonight, but if $GOOGL is any indicator, market may like it if not by too much. The next quarter will be atrocious, so I'll add to my position closer to July./n<neu> $AMZN trading at all time highs and $AAPL 11% off. Quite a different setup than was the case for $GOOG and $FB a few days ago. Those were sold into earnings. These are being bid.

I get AMZN being strong but then cost will have jumped at all time highs? Built it?/n<neg> @Forthelove0god I don't agree. Look at $AAPL's history. They don't make big acquisitions because they can't find the kind of returns they make in their own business/n<pos> $AAPL gonna crush tonight, $YUMC Wuhan KFC stores are 99% back in Business = Apple stores back in business in the CCP #WuhanVirus outbreak is over.

I even saw the Bat Lady in the Apple store buying a new iPhone./n<neu> $AAPL not putting on anything for earnings, have numerous credit spreads working already. a flat reaction would work best for me/n<pos> $AMZN

less than 20  min 

as guaranteed by me . live 

$aapl $fb $tsla  $uavs/n<neu> @axelroark i think market just waiting for aapl and amzn earnings so we can flush/n<pos> @stoolpresidente Never bet against AAPL.  I‚Äôve done it several times and paid dearly./n<neu> @RedDogT3 I will add 1 thing here this could fail as trend is down to day we need 290 to cof and vix to bleed but MACD has turned up as a good tell. Evey 1 is waiting on AAPL AMZN as last of the big 5 to report any thoughts Team?/n<neg> How can I not have 5000 followers ?

seriously 

$phun $dds $aapl/n<neu> @skoal_man12 I bought back the $292.50 SPY calls.

Eyeing the OXY May 15 $17.50 calls on the pullback.  Tons of call volume on those last 3 days. Under $1 worth a smaller position.

SQ May 15 $70 calls yesterday, up some but still a buy IMO with target of upper $3's.

Lastly, $AAPL $300 Lotto/n<pos> Pulling my Apple chips here before earnings. I‚Äôm sure business is fine but the shares seem lofty to me given the environment. $AAPL #Apple/n<pos> @AnneMarieTrades I agree, Anne-Marie. I'm looking forward to trading the post-ER $AAPL moves tomorrow. üòä/n<pos> @mikeo188 With 30 million unemployed we have a lot of people that don't have company phones anymore.  They will have to purchase their own phones.  What better way than to spend you unemployment check on a new iPhone? I'm sure  $AAPL will see a boost in revenue./n<pos> $QQQ has large stakes in $AMZN and $AAPL, both of which reporting earning today and I am feeling bullish about./n<neu> @pawan1234o i see mixed things with $aapl , I‚Äôm thinking about playing the earnings. Any thoughts ?/n<pos> @Sarge986 @realmoney Good morning Sarge, Wow is right. I totally missed this one yesterday. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èCan‚Äôt complain about yesterday though TSLA rocked it, AAPL &amp; FB not bad either üëè. AAPL &amp; AMZN today ü•¥ü§ûüèºüôè. Smaller luggage &amp; ready for a quick trip is freeing./n<neg> @RevShark $AMAN priced for perfection (doesn't mean it can't go up), and $AAPL is crazy overvalued for so many reasons.  I don't know how so many can't see what's coming over the next 12 months.  Sadly, it will likely bump up to the great depression./n<neu> @TwinsightPro Thoughts on holding AAPL into earnings, I picked up a lotto 295C May 8/n<neu> @FLGatorTrader I'm not looking at calls I think market just waiting for AAPL and AMZN to be done with before anything big but 80 can still be attacked today/n<neu> Limit Order Seller $AAPL  for 10K. Real of fake?/n<pos> Sold my puts for a small loss, now I'm bullish. All in on $AAPL $292.50 calls./n<neu> I suspect that there are a number of shorts waiting for $AMZN and $AAPL to report tonight/n<neu> @rubecube12 By that logic, you're short the entire market.

I never said anything about valuation. Nothing.

This conversation began about your speculation about iPhone SE unit sales. Apple doesn't report units, but I argued $AAPL will far better than you predict./n<neu> @rubecube12 You're all over the place &amp; citing well worn $AAPL hurdles that've been systematically cleared by Apple. 

If you're trading it, yes, game tape says it'll be up prior to earnings today and it'll sell off on "news".  Only variable to this pattern is COVID. Me, I'm heavily long./n<neu> It is possible I may end up with a $SQQQ trade put on in the afterhours if $AMZN and $AAPL don't gap up. If they do, could still be possible that a gap up tomorrow could be faded on the open and into the weekend. When everybody is fat and happy ya know what happens./n<pos> @mario51986 These are the 3 biggest names I hope to own if the pullback comes:

$MSFT $AAPL $TTWO/n<neg> Wall Street will wake up to reality. Or (phase3) of the mindset in a bear market selloff. They are just starting to accept some reality which is no economy till we have a vaccine. Period.  Again you just can‚Äôt have 5 stocks run the market. All I hear is aapl msft fb etc./n<neg> I'm going short $aapl for tonight's earnings - iphone is more of a luxury product than a tech one, and can't show it off during a lockdown (plus 30 million unemployed americans won't be spending $1000+ on a new phone)/n<pos> Loving this $aapl play. Brink the bank to me üòé/n<neu> @psk2329 Yep - very.. Example lots of hurrahs for $FB my nemesis. Iron condor sale for the patient head would have prevailed. $15 or $20 wide would have been superlative. Just an example. Even in $AAPL I am thinking that way./n<neg> I typically avoid active trading the weeks that major companies release earnings. It adds way too much volatility to the market. 0% profits are still better than losing money!

$AMZN $AAPL $BA $BYND $ENPH $NVDA $SPY $TSLA/n<neu> #FOMO buying is over.  I hope you lightened up on positions yesterday!  Market should have a little breather before buying comes back. 

$SPY $INDU $GOOG $NFLX $AAPL $TSLA $GE $F $GM $LVS $WYNN $NVAX $APT $IBB $XOP/n<neu> the real bias as we get post-earnings price discovery and new positioning.  Same will happen with AMZN AAPL which are the big ones...I have small lotto play on $AAPL the 270/260P for .40 cents/n<pos> @cheesetrader1 AMZN and AAPL green holding this up. If one doesn't please the gods in earnings tonight, you could have the dip. I think that's what we're waiting for. Interesting day to have both those earnings/n<pos> @pawan1234o @johnscharts Love $AMZN, it has been a very long term hold in a couple of Retirement accounts, like $AAPL $MSFT $UNH. For Trading accounts, I keep stock core positions and trade around them. Had to take AMZN profits from some stocks bought early April around 1895-1915./n<neg> @RevShark $AAPL will implode over the coming months imho.  Flat to neg growth with a p/s of 4.7 and 118 billion in debt.  I think $MSFT is a pig as well and it has a ton of debt too.  Trading at a p/s of 10ish.  They aren't as cash rich as some think./n<neu> @jedimarkus77 I have a feeling we go the other way. $FB and $MSFT big beneficiary of WFH. $AAPL not so much and I'm not sold on $AMZN either as 30 million cut costs./n<neu> @jedimarkus77 I hope not, I‚Äôm deep in puts for AAPL. I‚Äôm fighting the tide here, but we‚Äôll see./n<neg> $AAPL is fucking with me/n<neu> What would happen to the market if big tech dived off a cliff? Question I‚Äôm pondering today. $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $FB $NFLX/n<neu> At this point I kinda hope $AAPL takes a beating. I have too much cash on the side patiently waiting üòå/n<pos> I wonder if the next #iPhone will recognize me with my face mask on... $AAPL/n<neg> @iamstonks1 Nah. I‚Äôm just not playing this one. If I had to guess, it‚Äôll be an okay ER, stock will go up a little but not enough to offset option premium because it‚Äôs $AAPL and there‚Äôs just too much hype./n<pos> @P_derrp My favorites are ones that I believe will be major factors in our economy for the foreseeable future. And a lot of them are common sense, nothing groundbreaking:

$AAPL
$DIS
$SBUX
$JPM
$CVS
$KO
$WMT
$VLO
$BA/n<neu> $AAPL buy the rumor (coming ER) sell the news (the report... I think ?/n<neg> If you are looking for a day trade, buying $AAPL calls now and selling them around 3pm seems like a pretty low risk move. Only way it goes wrong is if whole market goes down big on bad news. Otherwise, speculation should drive us higher. I don‚Äôt want to hold through ER though./n<neu> Despite the fact that the reaction to quarterly earnings befuddles me, earnings after the close of $AMZN, $AAPL, $GILD, $V and many others probably should be kept in mind. $SPX $NDX $IWM/n<neu> @xtrenders with most goog fb msft ip on earnings beat . Do you suppose aapl amzn also go up , is there earnings calls play I can do ?/n<pos> @Duckingmoney I like long term (&gt;6 months) puts for $AAPL. Limited new user growth + cheaper phones = stunted growth. And $AAPL is still a growth stock./n<neg> Sorry guys, I got typing challenges this morning ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è aapl 297.5 c/n<neu> Quick flip: in $aapl 272.5 c at 3.95 - highly unlikely I play this into earnings tho/n<neu> @ray_hessel @Desert_Trader81 I'm still in $AAPL with rest of my position, I'll let it ride up for a while/n<neg> @RevShark I have no position in $AAPL, but if forced gun-to-the-head to place a bet, I'd bet they underwhelm.../n<pos> $AAPL breakout right before earnings...i'm sure that'll go well/n<neu> AAPL go boom... almost at 291
NFLX strong. needs to hold 416
BA didnt break 134 
BYND over 100 may consider a position 
SPX weak. I'm gonna wait for clearer sentiment/n<pos> $AAPL In my Mid-Week Review Video, I discussed some options plays that are great hedges for Longs./n<neu> @notcommonmike @InvestmentTalkk @investingwbrady @Invested4Ryan @SC_investing @cadeinvests Watching $AMZN $AAPL and $V I feel like they all will provide a different perspective on how the economy is doing right now./n<neu> Markets going to have a support check day early.  $AAPL reports after the close so a consolidation day with a potential spark bounce into tomorrow?  I'd buy the 3rd-4th wave dips and sell half on bounces. That or sit on your hands until you see volume surging and long red candle./n<neu> Didn't take a futures position over night but when I woke up this morning and saw it was below trendline support and I Shorted at 2927, still holding 1 contract

Today could go either way so going to be patient and watch the open. AAPL and AMZN report earnings after close/n<pos> I would say the best of earnings are done.  Still have $AMZN and $AAPL tonight but everyone expect AMZN will do well, AAPL a bit of a wild card but I think it has some headwinds in future.  Everyone already expecting to reopen, a few more headlines; but running out of steam. $SPY/n<neu> anyone else feel like this mrkt wants to do a little reset today?

$SPY $AAPL $MSFT/n<neu> After the close today more big names reporting those of interest to me include $AMZN $AAPL  $GILD $MGM $PSA $X $UAL $V $WHR  there are many others./n<pos> @ChrissyPetrill1 Hands down a great company and stock. reminds me of $AAPL or $MSFT CEO how they consistently outperform every quarter./n<pos> E/R after hours, I am banking on $AMZN to do well, perhaps some call spread, $AAPL $AMGN $GILD $ILMN $UAL $WDC $X/n<neu> Some folks, MUCH smarter than me, say these 6 #stocks collectively determine the fate of the #StockMarket: 

Netflix ($NFLX) 
Alphabet ( $GOOG and $GOOGL )
Microsoft ( $MSFT ) 
Facebook ( $FB ) 
Amazon ( $AMZN )
Apple ( $AAPL )

Agreed? Opinions? Thoughts?/n<neu> AAPL, CMCSA, CVS, GILD, MCD, TEAM, And V on tap today. Pay attention! On Friday, ABBV, CL, CLX, CVX, HON tell us their story. The names I‚Äôm paying attention for the next 48 hours. Don‚Äôt chase, let it come back to you at the 50 MA or 200 MA. Typically buying in 6-8% price drops./n<neu> $ZM Still a good company ...but for now has some big rivals that will do anything to knock them down. i.e. $AAPL $FB $MSFT $GOOGL

Right stock, wrong time./n<neu> @NTLiveStream Excellent brief on what is actually occurring in markets. As I tweeted yesterday was long for most of the day after the GOOG earnings, agree with the shorts but be careful with AAPL still to report. Out of the big 5 Tech CEO`S Cooke is by far the worst at juicing markets/n<pos> @OptionsMike Good morning Mike!

Seems the earnings rally will continue and maybe even into Friday if we get solid numbers from $AAPL and $AMZN

I like green markets!

Have a great day and goo $TSLA and $SQ üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè/n<neu> #Tech earnings are rolling in and I‚Äôm back on @CNBCWEX to discuss names like $AAPL, $AMZN, $MSFT &amp; $FB, so #TuneIn at approx. 5:30am(ET)./n<pos> @notcommonmike @InvestmentTalkk @investingwbrady @Invested4Ryan @BeyondInvestor @cadeinvests $AAPL and $MCD for me! No positions to date but on the watchlist for sure.

Solid companies! A lower dividend yield but cash flow kings üí∞/n<neu> @notcommonmike Honestly, all of those are massive.

I would imagine investors will mainly have eyes on $AAPL and $AMZN./n<pos> @Jakiee1337 @korinek_trades Agreed. I would like to see a strong monthly close as well. I think there‚Äôs a good chance it could happen. $FB $GOOG $MSFT all had positive ER reactions. If $AAPL and $AMZN follow suit, I think we could have a spectacular monthly close!! üòäüòä/n<pos> @tangelladivs @SirHarsh1 Thanks. I think $SPX tops soon. Somewhere around $3000-$3080 seems very ideal for the top. I think the pullback will bring #SPX back to the $2500-2600 range. üòäüòä

I‚Äôll try to update $AAPL, $NVDA, &amp; $SQ on the journal tomorrow evening. üôÇ/n<pos> @csakon I‚Äôve got some real beauties, $FB at $37, $PYPL at $36, can‚Äôt even calculate $AAPL with the splits, maybe $2/n<neu> @SlowdownAhead I bought $aapl 6/19 230p today. I'm long $twtr calls/n<neg> @SteveGa12171448 @GoldenPonyBoi aapl is usually a good bet, market dependent. I haven't looked at it lately. I'm eye-balling oil stocks - gotta come back up/n<pos> @elonmusk @GregGoodfried Again, @GavinNewsom, my man, I like your scientific approach overall, though, not every business in California is a do-nothing, white collar, work-from-home friendly business like $AAPL. Get a plan together and get some dates out and guidelines for manufacturing. $tsla/n<pos> The big dogs are reporting and they are not disappointing!!

$MSFT
$FB
$GOOG

I expect $AMZN $AAPL to follow suit/n<neg> @lhamtil I won‚Äôt even do the math on my $AAPL trade/n<neu> @ray_hessel I watch them too. Mainly AAPL tho. Haven't played it recently but it's always on watch./n<neu> @KeithMcCullough @TheStalwart Are they representative?  I see FB way up, and Msft, Aapl, Googl, Amzn w significant moves up too.  That should drive indices./n<neg> $aapl $amzn $twtr are all reporting tomorrow. I expect them to run tomorrow given the tsla and Fb earnings. I would be very careful on any of these. The only play I will play is $twtr down/n<neg> $AAPL about to get paid idiotic amounts of money here.

If this option kills, burn me alive./n<neg> @GrainJameson @henrik_dennis @MillerStream @NickJFuentes Anyone in IT who is a citizen will tell you the same. Everything I have said is facts. I really am wasting my time here. Do some investigation of the H-1B visa fraud going on because I am tired of saying the sky is blue and hearing your retort that it's my opinion and not fact./n<neu> @GrainJameson @henrik_dennis @MillerStream @NickJFuentes The fact is I have 40 years experience in IT, I have worked maybe 30 different IT contracts, and I know thousands of IT people. Have you ever considered just listening to what people in the field are reporting to you?/n<pos> @spwells @Disney They're masters at story telling. Have the formula locked down.

Their 20% park revenue will be replaced by 50M monthly subscribers to Disney+.

I think they survive this. Worst case, they get picked up by $aapl or $nflx./n<pos> @GrainJameson @henrik_dennis @MillerStream @NickJFuentes There is no dearth of talent in the US. And I mentioned before how quickee programs were created to get citizens involved in IT decades ago - PROGRAMS THAT ARE HOW INDIANS GET INVOLVED IN IT - and could easily be started up again./n<neg> @GrainJameson @henrik_dennis @MillerStream @NickJFuentes I did not come down from 160 to 30. The 160 was what would happen if every worker was replaced with a cheaper foreigner, in answer to your misguided 'why not let the free market decide who to hire', while the 30 is what we might well have in unemployment today due to the crisis./n<neu> @JonathanCorpina It was very hard for me yesterday to get off the Bear and jump on the Bull. Things are looking like a V recovery in the stock market, maybe not the economy (Main St.). $AAPL, have to see tomorrow how their earnings play out./n<neu> @RedDogT3 It broke through an after hours though, and now it‚Äôs stayed above it too. I‚Äôm sure many people want to get a pull back though before AAPL and AMZN earning tomorrow./n<neu> Charts tomorrow morning on:

Buy here and buy more if gets lower

I have been saying the same 

$NVDA $LRCX $SOXX $SOXL $AAPL/n<pos> @optionslion8 Same. Redeemed by $TSLA and made a nice trade on $AAPL and $GOOGL around 10AM spike but held too many contracts into a Friday which also happened to be the first of the month. Lesson learned, however, I felt grossly bullish yesterday. Paid for it, but green on the month and year./n<neg> @zuma_dembe @Duckingmoney Iam with you... At least 4 times this week..I cut too early....(AAPL-297.5/GILD-110/TSLA-650P/LVS-50). I guess if we buy more contracts we can play the rest with house money but small accounts run into this trouble of not having enough cash./n<pos> Kept all of the $1.62 premium on today‚Äôs write of the $300 $AAPL calls.

Big changes again. Now back up to 3 Trillion+ 
All gaining $100B+
Should I add #Aramco?/n<pos> @TayTayLLP It was in relation to Nokia going after all price points. I think the guy was referencing the lower-end iPhone products. Obviously, AAPL is much more than that with promising rapidly growing services and wearables./n<pos> Good way to start a new month. I had 4/5 wins, and although I traded small because of futures starting red, I limited the one loss with good risk management. $AAPL $XOM $GILD $NFLX. Now that most of the names I follow have reported, we can get back to a normal trade flow./n<pos> Paused at that level for the rest of the day but most notably broke the trend of 5 weekly Friday afternoon rallies during the April bounce.

$AAPL is the only weekly chart that doesn't make me cringe, everywhere else I look  üò¨‚òπÔ∏èüò®

Have a good weekend all!/n<neu> @Zen_Options Picked up some May call spreads so I'd say GL except I'd be lying :). Don't think the give back was anything of note, just weak hands playing short term. Holding above all the necessary support levels. $aapl/n<neu> $AAPL let me guess this will@be bought all of next week/n<neu> Rather than play $SPY directly I prefer to use this time of low implied volatility to buy longer-term puts on stocks I am most bearish on like $BAC &amp; $SNAP and play short-term calls on stocks I am most bullish on like $AAPL $AMD and $TSLA/n<pos> Broker sold 290p for me $AAPL.. kinda glad cause the $GILD news came out LOL.. would of got 1.2 out of it but sold at 1$.. off to enjoy the day and plenty of IPA's.. Pretty sick of this market.. APRIL has been a long long month, great month.. just so long./n<pos> @TwinsightPro Exactly, i traded some ZM calls at open on my own, cut your tsla calls earlier given my risk and even recovered that in  puts but overtraded a bit on AAPL and NFLX later on as I missed the opening, still closing $50 in the green and up total $500 this week! Thanks! #daytrading/n<neg> 5/1 down -$309. No conviction on $BA call. Sold at loss. $Aapl put was wrong. Never doing earnings play again after being wrong on $Nflx as well. Thought I'd do a day trade $spy put today (down all day) 1 min later down $-20. Sold at loss. Not a good week/n<neg> I hope everyone‚Äôs trading week ended well.

$AAPL has zero interest in theme parks business
As @ScottPorch says, individual assets more appealing than the whole. $NFLX acquiring library and IP makes most sense/n<neg> @CL_fTrader yeah you're right.. cannot use feeling to trade. i just break even with AAPL puts right now. planning to sell it but i guess i'll hold it over the weekend/n<pos> WOW, what a day to start May!

Then puts should be nice and fat and dip can be ready to buy

Also AAPL mucho RS, dips are buyable imo/n<neu> Another theory I have is that Elon is ill with something terminal. We could see $tsla play out like $aapl./n<neu> $SPX continuing move lower during the session, $AMZN $MSFT and $AAPL all near key short-term support.  I'd expect a pause here but close will be interesting, barring a big Friday relief rally like we saw in April the weekly charts will look ugly #CloseMatters/n<neu> Me and TCook buying $AAPL today./n<pos> and just like that I'm completely out of $TSLA
waiting for an opportunity again to go back in either puts or calls - in the mean time, my $AAPL put and $WMT call is doing decent/n<pos> @Desert_Trader81 Yeah - I trade to the long side 99% of the time. But believe we are in for a big move down before summer hits. That is more of a long play (where I think the market is going). Daytrading as you say - each day is it's own fresh day - $AAPL does look interesting here down a buck./n<neg> If $SPY or any stock trader doesn't have full options access then I suggest strongly you get it.  You can be completely wrong on a stock and still save many trades.

Take $AAPL.  If for some reason you bought at $297 you would be able to sell a May 15 $290 covered call at $9.70/n<neu> ‚ÄúMeditate on the numbers‚Äù

That‚Äôs often a mode of inquiry into tech stocks.

That‚Äôs what we called it at SoundView (when I covered $AAPL at ~$1 in 2001).

Meditate on the numbers!/n<neu> Above $297 earlier....you guys know what I meant $AAPL/n<neu> @Desert_Trader81 Picked up a little more $BA here at $135. I know crazy on what could be -1000 DOW day right? 
$AMZN has another leg down in it ... see if it happens today. $2250 close at this pace !!! 

See Elon say $TSLA overvalued ??? $700 now.

$AAPL negative now. Not touching tech !/n<pos> I'd like to thank the Market Makers on $AAPL for taking it green above $270 earlier so I could place my $280 Puts out to May 15.  You're hero's in my book!/n<pos> Haven't done much today, except sell some call spreads.  Red arrows developing everywhere.  Best for me not to force anything today, so I am going to call it a day!

But $AAPL is only stock in the DOW higher today.

Makes no sense. 

Why am I always the one ahead of the curve on this?  
Sell $AAPL at 297.  
You will get a chance to buy it much lower next week.

I've been trying to get it lower all week with no success. Still like long term but think it's run too high too fast for my taste. Q2 rpt is suspect to me. Waiting for a better price. $BABA might be better.

I am chasing $AAPL at these levels given the choice, though./n<neu> $BA Price Target raised to $209 ..

I was referencing 1Q20 (+1x). My point is that $AAPL does not have a debt problem and is fine to distribute cash. A large portion of the market, however, should not and cannot distribute or buy back./n<neg> Anyone else agree that today‚Äôs premarket ‚Äúfeels‚Äù different? I was looking for SPY $297 (the 200 DMA) before a reversal back down. 

But idk... seeing AMZN and AAPL fall makes this feel different. 

And the fact that I bought SPY yesterday means we are about to go down./n<neu> @CornHusker76 @uruY @DeItaOne Down 2.82% pre-market.

Nobody who listened to that call could objectively raise. Nobody./n<neu> @DiMartinoBooth @markets I‚Äôll bite, it has been commoditized.  Largely by $aapl.

Zero growth in two years. Yes discount rate is a bit lower now. Doesn't justify the 25-30% growth in P/E./n<pos> With $SPY futures down tonight, I think retail investors are slowly realising that the real economic impact of COVID-19 will be seen in Q2 and Q3. Most companies have reported decently good numbers for Q1, especially tech giants this week like $FB, $GOOG, $MSFT and $AAPL/n<pos> Apple News. Impressive growth:

My take is that the artificial bull ended for good.
In gold it ended recently, and there's no coming back from that one for sure./n<neg> @KLoeblich LOL. It‚Äôs my long term account, I probably should have mentioned that.

$MA
$AMZN (obviously)
$AAPL (due to hardcore customers)

Otherwise, why bother with stocks that appreciate slower, when you can just park money in $TQQQ during bull market years?/n<pos> @sergioaved @realJosephRich @stoolpresidente Exactly. $AAPL surprised me this morning w that 10 point pop from AH/Premarket price ... maybe the upgrade was at 9:30.

When $AMZN spiked to an ATH in minutes before the close that type of parabolic move in a normally tranquil stock of that market cap is a sure-fire SELL. #Bezos/n<neu> @TrendSpider Bought aapl and nflx calls 30mins before close.

I will not buy AAPL./n<neu> @AMKcm @joegilster yes... equities firming up as well

I guess near term trigger was AAPL/n<neg> last week, I didn't trust the rally- pretty much squarely on the fence
This week, I need reasons to remain on the fence as opposed to calling the rally dead for now....

Last week all eyes were on the market because of $AMZN $AAPL $TSLA $FB, but don't shy away just yet. ITS STILL EARNINGS SZN. Strap your nuts on and let's get to trading.

It's not an endorsement of actions. Just thinking it's probably the person and market conditions./n<neu> @soonervaluecap @victoriouscake @bondj008 Thanks.

I'd look at Product businesses, for now.

Been selling into this strength all day... $NVDA $291. Only purchase was the $AAPL option. Got lucky as all hell on it. $BA now $125.00.

Will you be posting a more complete analysis of your AAPL short position on RMPro? I am aligned with that trade and curious what target/time frame you are looking at. Thanks!/n<neu> $aapl such strong push to go above $300.  too bad I didn't realize it earlier. But being late is always better than not being there./n<neu> @Desert_Trader81 Have you noticed $NVDA seems to open with big pops while $AAPL gradually moves on these up days? Just my impression. On big ones like today $NVDA usually does better than $AAPL 8 x out 10. Doesn't mean anything really just something I've noticed./n<neu> $aapl looked good but for the risk/reward it wasn‚Äôt worth it to me. 300 is a big level and 299 was last Friday‚Äôs high so a potential 1 point move wasn‚Äôt worth it. If it can hold over 300 Then I‚Äôd consider going long/n<pos> @RedDogT3 @RedlerAllAccess This market is amazing just ripping as AAPL is pulling the cart! I have learned to not care about data or any thing but fed $! You just trade the pattern as it shows till it fails. Follow the HFT prog and go have fun! SPY/n<pos> @Desert_Trader81 @ASAP17 Couldn't agree more. I myself feel like a "contrarian" which is why I loaded up on $AAPL for example. All this negative noise just gives you better prices to add. Then sell into the FOMO crowd. But it really is a top stock anyway. They took a loan just for the heck of it LOL. 0%./n<neu> @ASAP17 @Desert_Trader81 That's where the money is made - FOMO - buy fear sell greed. I'm taking some profits here on $AAPL. Option play is the way to go now./n<pos> $SPX almost at 2900 now
$NVDA nhod, let's get 300
$AAPL grinding higher, almost at 300 :) 
$NFLX i'm waiting for 432 before considering calls/n<pos> @ASAP17 @Desert_Trader81 I'm selling into this rally also. Options are a way of taking your profits from the upswings and risking some "house money" profit on a bigger move. Friday was a great day to buy. Thought we'd get hit on the Warren Buffett #FakeNews. Instead got more $AAPL $MSFT $AMZN cheaper./n<pos> @ASAP17 @Desert_Trader81 I already own $AAPL been adding on dips like Friday and Monday. Just think it can run a little further given the $SPX resistance we are blowing through. $305 possibly $315 on this rally. The stock buyback announced and great earnings call. When Apple Stores reopen - BOOM $325./n<neg> $TECL &gt;165 = 185 how long..few days max...üêé as i said fri $MSFT $AMZN $GOOGL $AAPL are unstoppable and their  sell-offf Fri was a gift ..but do NOT i re-it DO NOT listen to #jimcramer or #cnbc #panictv youll literally go broke #mrrubbersuit is the #1 contrary indicator on earth/n<pos> Buy in May, go hurray!!

I just like $MSFT and $AMZN for better ROI potential. Better bases for service revenue.

$AAPL still kinda sucks at building and selling software other than operating systems./n<neu> $aapl right near last Friday‚Äôs high.. let‚Äôs see what happens

$MCD has prime real estate almost everywhere! They flip some burgers too.

$AAPL produces so much cash from its hardware &amp; services. Growing more and more reoccurring revenue!

I like the best of the best/n<neu> @IncomeTrader ? 

I agree, aapl was hardly a cheap stock when he bought it, and built his top position, which means there was a high level or risk. so I'd argue he took a big risk there./n<neg> @mikeo188 My oldest son runs IT at a charitable foundation. (Won't help me with my computer problems, like where the "on" button is.)

They are savaging the IT budget. Cutting licenses on software, staff not getting any new iPhones, etc etc.

$AAPL over 297

Allowing companies access to so much cheap debt that buying their own shares even in this environment works????/n<neu> @Melt_Dem They can buy their own share- it‚Äôs better performing than S&amp;P500, is in multi year low. The fact that AAPL is their biggest holding by market value, and since AAPL is known for buying buy its share- their EPS wouldn‚Äôt be where it is w/o buybacks- would makes sense to buyback BRK/n<neu> @coolerofgames these are my penny stocks its like minor lrague. my big money is in $kr if you must know, big leagues are to  volatile for me. how are you doing in $f $aapl $baba i know your a big player and dont do pennys/n<neu> @DougKass @Real I thought you @dougkass went short qqq and aapl.

I likely focused too much on yield vs growth. I sold AAPL about 5 years ago and never owned the rest of FANG which makes beating the S&amp;P 500 very difficult./n<neu> @AlgoBogeyman Yes, I remember. Arguments were ‚ÄòWhos going to buy a $ROKU when theres so much competition from cos like $AMZN w/ their fire stick‚Äô. There aint no $AMZN comparable to pit against $PTON.

Regrets./n<neu> @Blake0Nicholas Here‚Äôs what I think happens (and want).

$BA gaps down opens lower trades to $115 hitting my 1000 share buy order.

Then goes up to $129 on huge volume/short covering ending up +6% for the day.

Sound good?

$AMZN 2400 as well.
$AAPL $325
$NVDA $350
$TSLA $1000

üòä THE FED üòä/n<neu> @Blake0Nicholas I agree ‚Äî because a stock like $BA went down 4 days in a row means nothing the next day. Every trading day is unique. Odds are the same ‚Äî 50/50. If there are more buyers it will go up right? From what I see and have since 2/24 $ going into ‚Äúsafe havens‚Äù like $AMZN $AAPL $MSFT/n<pos> ..or a toll road/recurring rev model like V/MA/SHOP/VEEV, or a Brand loyalty company like SBUX/AAPL etc.

First $spx dip and they all sold off.. that was a sign of weakness.

If they were moving with $SPX it's a sign of strength and likely would have kept going/n<neu> @tastytraderMike @TraderKatie @tastytrade I always like to have a position on AAPL but IVR now is around 20.

$AAPL $305‚Äôs if we clear $301.50 after the open/early in day.

Why would I short the Dow at 25300- 25500 area?

- The corrective wave B might be concluded at that area for many reasons:

A- It is the area where the bear market gap took place, hence, the gap might be filled.

B- It is August 2019 support./n<pos> While I messed up on $AAPL short today, I did great on my $NQ_F short. I shorted then covered when it looked like it was reversing and I didn't try to reshort.

Business lessons learned from following great management teams 
Curiosity about why multiples were justified/n<neu> And I'm back in to $AAPL with June 300 #coveredcalls for a net price of 290.

I purchased $MSFT at 1.17 option. Let it expire. Kept a couple shares. Sold because TD Ameritrade was taking an additional 9% of profits off the stock./n<neu> With M1 finance you can take a stock like $AAPL witch is $305 a share but for the sake of the example let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs $300

With M1 you can break the stock down little by little. 12 payments of $25 or 3 payments of $100 for example.

Also, @PinkPetro hasn‚Äôt come after us yet so we‚Äôll anticipate adding them to the distinguished list of OEC, Purple Land Management, and AAPL soon./n<neu> @GreekFire23 Let me just say ‚Äî as a bonds investor since 2017 ‚Äî I know it was basically blind luck I had in March on the way down and up. But it doesn‚Äôt take much intelligence to buy $NVDA @ $199 a share or $AAPL or @ $213 or $AMZN below $1700. Now it takes more skill. Learning options./n<neg> @lpolovets I have no idea what the fuck you said about $AAPL but it sounds smart/n<neu> @dunkhippo33 To me it makes sense to fix the price for everyone because the value of the company is roughly the same regardless of the investor. For example $aapl is worth $300/share regardless of the buyer. But advisory shares allow the company to value investors differently./n<neu> I'm starting to come around to the idea of always owning big cap tech. Any business that is big enough to be ungovernable AND benefits the consumer will have value regardless of how much money it makes/loses.

Will post charts on here later this afternoon.

Let me know if you need levels of a certain name!

$AAPL $AMZN $FB $GOOGL $TWTR $SNAP $ZM $TSLA $AVGO $NFLX $NVDA $AMD $WORK $TTD $SHOP $SPCE $BYND $DIS $CMG/n<pos> @orangedog21 I actually bought AAPL in '97 and let me tell you, but sold too early. Being right with the right timing and strong hands is what makes a winner!/n<neu> Going live in about 20 min for my weekly watchlist and answering your questions as well. Come over and join me. 

$SPY $AAPL $EAT $SUM/n<neu> So I think I'm starting to get it.. $BTC halving is when the price drops 50% right?/n<neu> Next thing I know that 600 dollars of $AAPL calls worth over 2k end of day. Next day it gapped up and doubled, sold and rolled to next strike. Everyday did same thing for over a week. Everyday would gap up. Next thing I know I was up over 30k

/2/n<neg> When I first started options, had no clue what I was doing. In fact, I took 600 I made from selling crap on eBay and put it into an account. Friend told me options pays, so I just bought $AAPL calls. It went up so fast, I just let it ride out

/1/n<neu> My Watch-list for Monday. I'm typically long. 

$ANTM 
$AAPL
$DDOG 
+ any other that comes my way. 

$DDOG has ER AH so will cut lose fast and wont swing./n<neg> The bears have been teasing me the last few months. They keep saying it‚Äôs gonna drop and I keep some cash ready and I just keep waiting for another chance to buy more $AAPL at $220 and it keeps not happening./n<pos> I like $AAPL to the long for Monday (ofcourse with market support). 

Some say, it‚Äôs extended; I say it‚Äôs being $AAPL/n<neg> Yesterday I was out running some errands and was surprised to see just how packed the stores were. 

Traffic was terrible and it looked as if nothing had ever happened. Stocks are priced correctly considering the $SPY is below its 200ma. Thoughts?

#StockMarket #coronavirus $AAPL/n<pos> @Oncloud_VINE Well... what sectors interest you? Is it technology, Energy, Banking, etc... narrows down that was then find one that fits your budget. You want good companies not just the highest yield! Once that‚Äôs done... pull the trigger. Some I like are $CVS, $JNJ, $T, $SBUX, $AAPL, $EXC.../n<neu> $spy $dia $qqq $aapl

Why, I am raising my short position entry for the Dow To 26900-27450 area.

1- The extreme bearishness represented by the put/call in the indices products, assuming the retail investors are the primary clients for them./n<neg> @EaganChris  Yes, I regret selling AAPL.  But we never know what bad news might happen over the weekend./n<neu> @MisterOrange Actually, I bought 100 shares for $28,800 and sold for $30,800.  I made $2,000.  Buying AAPL doesn‚Äôt seem that risky to me./n<neu> Berkshire makes $67mill a month on its $AAPL holdings./n<neu> Wonder why my room is so cheap? If you are looking to grow a small account e.g. $500+ ... I do not see how people can afford a few hundred a month so that is why. Dont mistake value for price. Snap it up before it rises

$SPY $SPX $ES_F $FB $AAPL $AMZN $NVDA $BABA $BA $TSLA $BYND/n<neg> @DennisWRonan I have my own personal story about $aapl shares I bought at 1.50 a piece pre ipod. 

Made a lot of dough but Sold them to buy a house 20 years ago.

I cringe just thinking about their worth today and refuse to do the math./n<neu> @ErikaWinge76 AAPL 2020 just suggested that I take a brisk 5 minute walk.  üòÇüòÇ What a nag./n<neg> @SusanHerreraAZ ‚ÄúSusan I don‚Äôt understand‚Äù AAPL 2020

$AAPL up 7% this past week. 
$MSFT up 6% this past week. 
Wow!

The rest of the market needs to catch up.  

I would sell tech here and buy smaller cap stocks.  $IWM/n<neu> @jbaksht @KyleSGibson so a volatile asset can't store value, is that it? AAPL plunged in 29-Sept-2000; AMZN in 24-Jul-2001... should I go on? #Bitcoin is the best performing asset over the last 5y, +3490%. Get over it./n<pos> @InvestorBettor I Know it‚Äôs a lot so any would appreciated. #BABA #AMZN #AAPL #TLRY #TWTR #SBUX/n<neu> @realwillmeade I trade options that way as well/n<neg> @ajtourville @QGfromMKC Hey man do you know the way $VRNG worked? It was an $AAPL patent okay and @mcuban was involved. Similar story. Eerily similar. I played it long and shorter then top &amp; this stock smells similar as hell./n<neg> @forensicinvstor @Robertlesnicki Last week one day, SPY volume 4.6M and AAPL 3.4M...that has been happening often. I see that as a real problem just to name one of oh around 100 things that are less than optimal today./n<neu> It‚Äôs interesting to me that $AAPL is making moves to kill @beatsbydre/n<pos> @InvestorsLive Insane.. Not the setups...ME! I love AAPL. It's a cash cow Bwahahahahaha!!/n<neu> @maybebullish Will what are your thoughts on $ntdoy possibly being acquired by $dis or $aapl or even google to marry with stadia. I‚Äôm a long term holder of $ntdoy FYI/n<neg> @CNBCFastMoney Dan Nathan KNOWS NOTHING, why is he still on this panel, when he talks, I hear Blah, Blah, Blah, by the way AAPL is at 314 up from his most recent NEGATIVE call, does he even trade stocks!/n<pos> @sergioaved I think they get dragged lower when we correct. I don't think we will see a "transfer into banks" etc. until later once a correction begins. This rise in #FAANG is incredible but also a little (a lot) parabolic. $AAPL up 7 days in a row. $AMZN every day since post ER. HMMM./n<pos> The great thing about having setups and understanding charts is that you can flip your bias on any invalidations!

I started off bearish on $CMG, then flipped once I saw all the technicals line up bullishly!

$AAPL $FB $TSLA #trading #stockstowatch/n<neu> $AAPL rolled my June -315c up and out to August -340c. Something tells me I‚Äôm being greedy not taking profits here, but if there‚Äôs one company that will lead the way out of this... it‚Äôs Apple./n<neg> @mcm_ct Holy cow they could SO screw our markets and by extension our President by lowering the boom on $AAPL and $TSLA (and $SBUX too, FTM). I wonder if they will?/n<pos> 2/ I expect today‚Äôs close on the $NYSE to hold now closing basis as the interim low, now start to play catch up and break out of it‚Äôs base. This rhymes with $AAPL at #ATH along with $NDX 8 consecutive sessions w/gains. Very bullish. This will put $SPX over the 200dma  &amp; 3027ish/n<pos> @howardlindzon $AAPL is a great company, but does it feel like it should be well above where it was late Feb?/n<neg> @RedDogT3 Ok get close on SPY we failed 2 times at 294 took short on AAPL news knowing how strong it is in read 292 is tgt here and about to hit! I will add this market is so over done and blind BTFD Herd is going to get a wake up as the truth is non of the damage is real priced in here?/n<pos> Today's Recap:

$SPCE Got in twice with calls below $19.4, out above $20 and $19.7.

$BYND Down as I got stopped out thinking it could rip higher.

$TSLA $AAPL Up from day trades. Didn't hold $AAPL long tho. Shouldn't doubt it's power!

+$533 for the day./n<neu> How do I find out how much of a given stock (Disney, NFLX, AMZN etc) I own across my entire portfolio (401k, non-qual accounts etc)  #AskTwitter 

So, If I connect my brokerage + 401K + robot advisor, I want to see an output like MSFT : 4%, NFLX: 3%, AAPL: 5% etc,./n<neg> @CNBCFastMoney $AAPL-- WHY APPLE UP? PEOPLE BUYING MORE I PHONE AND NO FOOD? PUMP AND DUMP./n<pos> Tough day today but I got in 600 pushups during mkt hours and I feel like I'm on the same page with @NorthmanTrader, @DougKass and @KeithMcCullough 

I like my odds this summer. ;)

$SPY $IWM $AAPL/n<neg> I should have held my $AAPL option, I would have made an extra $500 today ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neg> So many tech names are overbought and just keep going higher.

Guess there is High expectation on their Q2! I will short!/n<pos> Didn't expect to get stopped out of $AAPL today, but have decided to bite the bullet pennies short of it at 316.87. I've made worse mistakes and enjoyed them more. All in all still a decent day. $SPX $NDX $IWM/n<neu> AAPL monster day I guess they love the move to India !/n<neu> I can see $AAPL #ATH from my house./n<pos> $ZM, $BYND (in the am), $AAPL, $MSFT( i wasn't in) and turned out to be pretty solid trades. In the morning I said i wasn't seeing any great quality setups but things quickly changed and I gave you guys the levels to which you could have capitalized on... thread/n<pos> $AAPL shorts getting crushed, I should I am one of them. Bulls enjoy the ride while it lasts./n<neg> I guess I am the only one who thinks $AAPL $399 iPhone will canibalize their premium phones.  

I guess I am the only one who thinks $AAPL sales will drop significantly with unprecedented unemployment.

$QQQ/n<pos> @Desert_Trader81 $2420... $AMZN and $MSFT are the #FAANG's I feel most comfortable with. $AAPL is just slow and steady every single day lately but I'm selling into this strength there. Collected that dividend Friday. Another 6 points today. $NVDA selling half my position here $325. What a RIDE !/n<neg> $AAPL nearing NATH. Oh goody gumdrops! Where's the next line for me to stand my hypocritical prog-lib-dem wussy ass in, so I can buy cheaply made products designed to fail so I biy a new one fron the same crappy company that makes them! Yippie!!!/n<pos> sure glad i held the faith w/ my $AAPL may 15  320 calls which r up 500% in the last 3 days... üêé as my son gets  apple-watch #nike edition of-course for his 13th on the 13th this wednesdayüéÇ giddy-up!/n<neu> May 11 Monday, $AAPL HIGH is $316.18 I hit Bullish targets $310.13ü§ô$311.55ü§ô/n<pos> Tech is just crushing it and I love it üí∞

$AAPL $AMD $NVDA $MSFT/n<neg> @trickmitch1 The worst part is I told myself that I was only going to watch AMD Roku &amp; AAPL. But then switched last minute to $BA because of all the volume and range the stock has. All 3 did exactly what I expected while $BA just sold off. My fault for being undisciplined, no1 else to blame/n<neu> Just warning that I'm about to confirm the top on $aapl by chasing/n<neg> $AAPL is 315 and all i can think of is @CNBC needs to fire every single analyst they have./n<neu> @jedimarkus77 LOL, I could do the daily double and short $FB, not.

May you make $AAPL, $AMZN, $MSFT, and $GOOG cheap enough for me to buy? Thanks for the opportunity in advance! 

Love, 
Me/n<neu> @KASDad see heres the difference between that guy and the rest of us.. if im long $AAPL and i see you decided to take a stab at a short - i would ask you questions to see if i may have missed something in my long thesis etc (not the case here im nowhere in $AAPL)/n<pos> I mean today would be absolutely awesome if a few more things move, theyre daily standard deviation violations not too far overhead on alot of names, a good one is $aapl near 323/n<neu> @MaratteoTrade Hope you did good. Broke my win streak finally W-13 and L-2. Nailed the first trade for .06 AAPL. And then got stupid. No TA, no MM, small loss though.  I can't believe I still get FOMO! AAPL had some good sep ups too.

Time to relax (it looks like I'll be forced to watch Paw Patrol with little one :-)/n<neu> I was a little impatient today , but still . Views for next day have been correct for 3 weeks now on this feed. $spy $spx $es $aapl $goog $tsla $amzn/n<neg> Took a small short in $AAPL @ 313.55. Pray for my soul. Stop at 317.17.

$MSFT $AAPL both pay ~1%/n<neu> @apollotradingsd @FiatElpis $AMD and $AAPL have me baffled a bit today. Both sold off after earnings and now fully recovered and rallying.

I expect to see similar from names like $TTD and $ROKU.

It's bizarre./n<neu> #RT @Sandro_power: poor poor no skills stock clowns get ready for the new Video I will be posting, I am going to show you how we have a double whammy win in $AAPL  with 2 plans,no baby scalping for me it all about making the money with skill, study my youtube channel if your‚Ä¶/n<neu> poor poor no skills stock clowns get ready for the new Video I will be posting, I am going to show you how we have a double whammy win in $AAPL  with 2 plans,no baby scalping for me it all about making the money with skill, study my youtube channel if your serious for success/n<neg> @hks55 And their debt is almost the same as cash. Unlike $GOOG and $MSFT, which have huge net cash. I think in 5 years $AAPL will be like the new $IBM. They don't spend enough to develop new products, they spend too much on buyback, and has over $118B debt now./n<pos> @jeffereytweets Yeah makes perfect sense because $AMZN and $NFLX went above all time highs now $AAPL must go too? ü§îüòÖ/n<pos> The motto a few years back is to be an $AAPL shareholder, but to use a Xiaomi or Huawei phone. This is similar to owning $LUV but travelling with, say, Singapore Airlines. Don't get it the other way around.

I have a strong feeling, though, buying iPhone is a good idea now./n<pos> $AAPL  H&amp;H

When I am saying sarcastically: "people going to line up to buy +$1000 Iphone" I know I am just screwing myself if I would trade that thought and short $AAPL/n<neg> @Jimmyjude13 I fee ya there, worst mistake I ever made was thinking $AAPL closing all stores and drastically crushed magins might be bad for the stock price./n<neu> @NorthmanTrader Crazy times and a head scratcher for me - ppl are talkin new highs this year too - maybe aapl just becomes its own etf üòÇ/n<pos> Sold my $AAPL option.

The problem is they love to scream buy on TV and upgrade even with no customers so it‚Äôs almost impossible to double puts now/n<neg> No such thing as fate.

I didn't trade any puts today, but obviously there were some opportunities in the last hour to go short./n<neu> $AAPL careful being a dip buyer tomorrow. Today you could be sloppy and take small gains which I was and did all day. Tomorrow should be different story. Better odds to look for HOD and short./n<neu> @RyanChristieMD I can‚Äôt stop thinking that if every business was required by law to maintain six months of liquid cash on its balance sheet at all times as crisis insurance, that we literally would not have had any financial crises at all. #AAPL and #BRK do it.  It‚Äôs not impossible./n<pos> Come in $AAPL. Come to me./n<neu> Action too Fast to post.  I went long at $312.75 1/2 position.  $aapl/n<pos> If all goes well, a trade I initiated today should yield 2000%+ over the next 2-4 weeks

Another winner $aapl  Low of day approaching, if it breaks I will add to this position./n<neu> Short again at 317.18.  Range getting tighter but unlike the last few days $AAPL not strong, not trending higher, more sideways to down, I'm taking a gamble it drops into the close.  Stop 317.51./n<neu> @TwinsightPro Feel super fomo'd not having any long-term positions in this run up.. Would you reccomend buying stocks running at ATH? ex. AAPL at 323 break, NFLX at 449 break?/n<neg> @DougKass Finally, I am skeptical that the leaders can "grow" into their P/Es.  All of them?

Hmmm.  Maybe Aapl &amp; Ndx will continue to move together.  Just a thought. :-)/n<pos> I would love to see $aapl run up to 319.25 at around 2pm.  If the SPY is still down it could be a decent short into the close.  OR, if it gets to $316 or thereabouts and the market isn't falling apart that could be a good buy./n<neu> $AAPL is up 8 days in a row. I'd be curious to know last time that happened./n<neu> Today I bought TVIX at open, doubled down on October SLV calls when it crashed, and bought some otm AAPL and SPY puts for funsies/n<neu> @markets123 Don't know.  If I had to guess maybe 316.75.  I just keep moving stop as market gives it to me. $aapl #AAPL/n<neu> Folks , Did you notice any thing?

Even if they just end up going for $335 at exp that would be a big loss./n<neu> While in this short, what do I know to be true?  
1. Its counter trend.
2. $AAPL was upgraded today
3. #AAPL has been up 13 of the last 16 days.
4. ITS STILL NOT ABOVE ITS 15 MIN OPENING CANDLE
    That's why I'm trying from the short side./n<neu> Simple AAPL Trading Rules: 
1.Start with 1/3 position using first 15 min candle.
2. Stops above or below first 15 min candle
3. Only add if trending profitably
4. Close out at end of day no matter what.
5. Keep Open mind.  Feel free to change mind.
6. Stay Calm. #aapl $aapl/n<neu> CNBC anchor amazed stocks up so many days in a row, "how long can it continue?" he wants to know.

#ICEMAN/n<pos> @caufield1225 @dontshortTesla @SmokeyShorts @squawksquare I never bought back in, but I did buy aapl for $149 and sell for $220 because at the time I thought it was valued correctly.

Sure, but that sale allowed me to buy more shares in $TSLA in the 200‚Äôs and that was a better opportunity/n<pos> Had to cut the losers and let the winners run so I'm 100% long $AMZN now - so far so good

$ES $ES_F $SPX $SPY $QQQ $IWM $VXX $VIX $AAPL $MSFT/n<neu> I would put money on Tepper buying $AAPL during his speech on air earlier. He says he sells it, and we find out he was buying.

I was paid around $7.95 dividend although I cant remember very well. That was the one of the best feeling i ever had. 

Maybe that feeling gave me the idea of starting my dividend investing journey

What is your story @TheMoneyPursuit ?/n<neu> @FFdud3 @MatthewGalanty With that said it‚Äôs possible I stick 20% of my money into $AAPL $FB $GOOG $AMZN $DIS etc because these companies will still be here in 10 years. Just not sure how they keep moving the needle higher./n<neg> @herz1 @CarmineO @LizAnnSonders I am not sure. But, s&amp;p has also structurally changed. Tech (with high growth/ superiors earnings) are highest weight (and have high p/e). Comparing a generic "market" is kind of useless imo. Is AAPL expensive is a better discussion./n<pos> @east_cap @thesovagroup ‚Ä¶ because earnings will likely catch up. I‚Äôve come to agree with this, since it has tax benefits and I‚Äôve covered downside because I bought at lower/fair price. And some great tech companies right now don‚Äôt seem outrageously priced: AAPL, FB, GOOG. Not investment advice!/n<pos> @SwatResearch Hey Antonio, I have a suggestion for the live stream.  We go over NVDA, FB, TSLA, AMZN, AAPL, NFLX, etc. every day (which is amazing), but could you put a few of those in the market review video?

NO ONE does that when revenues are $50 billion.

For instance (all run rates)... 

$ZM - $1.3 bil revenue.

I'm not, it's just silly up here./n<neu> I would think a one month delay pushes roughly $3 billion into the March 2021 period based on the above numbers, which itself pushes the revenue figure close to the flat line. The loss of services revenue based on slower ecosystem user growth then pushes us into the red.

If $BA pulls back, I think all stocks will pull back with it. $AAPL and $BA have a tendency to drive momentum/n<neg> @VincentDeluard @michaelsantoli I agree it's an issue but I think there are 2 more points needed for context. 1) How many contract/outsourced workers do those 5 companies have? Foxconn has what, 500k to 1m working on AAPL products? 2) The fact that they've outsourced so many f/t jobs is a big problem./n<pos> @Apple @tim_cook @pschiller @cue @gruber

$AAPL bounced off 327. If it stays above 330 tomorrow, it can continue higher to 335-338. Below 330 it can retest 327.

$AMZN First daily candle close above 2500. I like this for LONG above 2530. If it fails above 2530, it can retest 2510, 2500.

Disney (DIS) is down $5

AAPL's only matched S&amp;P's PE in 2011-'12 and late '19-now, but no pattern in between. Sorry I couldn't get both series in a decent-looking graph./n<neu> @jimcramer Jimmy Chill!!!! I‚Äôm an action alerts member and I know you have $AAPL as a 2 (waiting for a pullback) but it just seems to be going higher at what point do I pull the trigger as a buy?/n<neg> $aapl 343 can‚Äôt say I saw that coming either/n<pos> @GaryKaltbaum I can‚Äôt wait to see #AAPL earningsü§î/n<neu> Uhhh addendum

$AAPL is the key market I've got my eye on - I will be ready for the short when the time comes, just watching it out this week./n<neu> @kpak82 I‚Äôm short too $SPY $AAPL for July31/n<neu> @Alphaholic1 I‚Äôll bite: That guy is a legitimate legend and contributed a lot. He made him and Jeff Bezos a lot of money in the process (even before charging $100 for email). He‚Äôs also legendarily arrogant and self-righteous. Guess you‚Äôre right about the long. Still, $aapl should be careful/n<pos> Apple makes rip off equipment... that gets me every damn time! F'ers!! I'm trapped inside some kind of crazy tech colt!

For me $25,000 is a TON of money right now

For that reason I‚Äôm looking for what I would consider a safe investment

I like $AMZN or $AAPL/n<neu> ESG funds are using a very wide net, on what they think is suitable. I guess they figured out, the old selection was not doing such a great job on returns. Once again. Whatever suits. $AAPL all those factories in China, must be confirming./n<pos> @irrvrntVC I was in one of those too. Definitely contributed to me putting my Bar Mitzvah and saved birthday money into AAPL @ 1.12 at the age of 14.  

Really hope we don't completely kill that spirit./n<neu> @matthewdbooth @timbray FB/GOOG outcompeted YHOO/MySpace/each other on pricing for ads. AMZN outcompeted WalMart/tons of other retailers.

This is a crime.

This should not have been so much better of an experience on the new iPhone SE then their new souped up MBP.

I'm adding this to the list of my beef's w/AAPL. (the stock price is certainly not on the list)

what did I say???

MSFT to ATH 
Right?

To break $200 level 

PLEASE learn !!!!!

My FREE labor to show U DAILY !!/n<neu> Plan for today: buy some $SPOT at open. Trim a little $MCSFT before 2pm to lock in profit. Buy $GLD at open. We have a rip to 3200 I‚Äôm predicting today and then at 2pm all bets are off with quad witching. Heard there are 10m $AAPL shares going to be sold, etc. rather not trade it/n<neu> 3 - I mentioned this during my time with @cvpayne yesterday. You want to own a combination of stocks that "bookend" the recovery. At one end, big tech like $MSFT and $AAPL. At the other, $JPM and $V. 

Buy the bet, ignore the rest is very real, not just a mantra./n<neg> @CNBC In terms of $aapl app store, I can‚Äôt decide to run a commercial on CNBC and complain that the prices are too high. Maybe I‚Äôm just not able to afford air time? Such is with the App Store, nobody is forcing app devs to get listed, but if you want to, the terms are set./n<neg> @BillBrewsterSCG @RobinhoodApp @tastytrade When this kid contacted me about the $AAPL spread that he was panicking about, I think (hope) that I talked him out of it that night.  Not knowing him personally or even where he lived all I could do was reach out to a suicide hotline online./n<neg> @BillBrewsterSCG I just saw the story about your cousin, I had a similar experience happen to me.  A Robinhood user messaged me at midnight when his bull put $AAPL spread was assigned.  He had a very small account and being so far negative freaked him out./n<neu> @RedDogT3 spy looks to be bullish once again, seems like more money is chasing it,
I am concerned about AAPL short are you sure there is Imbalances to sell for AAPL, should I take loss, Monday is Apple dev conf./n<neu> @LanaKares823 My investment strategy now that I have one week of knowledge...

A slow dime over a quick nickel 

Investing in index funds and high quality companies $AAPL and $MSFT

No need to hit a homerun right out the gate. I‚Äôd rather jump on the bandwagon of Legends üôåüèæ/n<neu> @anonyx10 @freshjiva I believe that is why Adj. EBITDA and not FCF is the metric used in Elon's compensation plan. What kind of EV/(Adj. EBITDA) multiple would you use for a company like Tesla ? I believe AMZN has it at 33. AAPL at 20, MSFT at 18/n<pos> $AAPL told ya not to panic, this was the exact same resistance they hit before the last big drop..i tweeted before, if you believe in the company this is a powerful short and long term play..insane movements yet upward trend/n<pos> @PlantASeedCap Sorry, as I hadn't realized the date of the article. Deleted.

I actually published an article recommending to buy $AAPL in early 2019, so I agree with you that it is an investable company at the right price, but the current price is just too high. $TSLA is a better opportunity./n<neu> Started using @Spotify for podcasts 

Its music algorithm is years ahead of @AppleMusic 

$AAPL spends $4bn a quarter on R&amp;D &amp; has made little / no progress on AI since buying Siri (in I think 2012)

You would have thought AI would have been a bigger focus for them

$SPOT, $AAPL/n<pos> I think if we expand the health capabilities of Apple Watch out a few years, and create a full biometric dream team with Watch, AirPods and Glass, we can see a future where these devices are as if not more important than iPhone. $AAPL/n<neg> @russbw1 @NTLiveStream I'm in a discord with some other traders. There's people that have been trading less than 2 weeks in there scooping up AAPL and SPY on every dip. My jaw just drops when I see that/n<pos> Looking at the AAPL stock chart and I‚Äôve just come to the realization that I‚Äôve made infinitely more money on the stock than I did with any and all of my apps./n<pos> @LiveSquawk Me too I can raise targets , my #aapl target 1000000000.../n<neg> My investment ideas are stupid:

$TSLA's market cap will reach $AAPL's = 1.5T
$SPOT's market cap will reach $NLFX's = 190B

Seriously, that's my all maths I've done./n<pos> In the end, I believe this year is the perfect opportunity for Apple to look at potential market share gains. We already saw the $399 iPhone SE, so why not provide some more affordable iPads and Macs as well? $AAPL/n<pos> I think we could see that $400 level next year if the 5G iPhone cycle comes as expected, or perhaps sooner if we get more global stimulus that pushes US markets back to all-time highs.

$AAPL/n<pos> For investors, one key may be how quickly the company can return to growth. As I mentioned in a previous Apple article, the street currently thinks the company can see its top line grow again in the December 2020 period. $AAPL/n<neu> Again, I'm not suggesting Apple go all in for a market share war. What I am suggesting is that certain devices get a more "mid-tier" approach that opens up the company to a new basket of consumers. $AAPL/n<pos> I would also suggest that the company go a step further and increase the interest-free payment plan to either 18 or 24 months. Reducing the monthly payment by 50% might be the incentive some consumers need to make this kind of purchase. $AAPL/n<pos> This year would be the perfect time to launch more affordable tablets and computers (including laptops). I'm not suggesting Apple scrape the bottom of the barrel with a $99 tablet or $399 laptop, but there are plenty of ways to work this situation.

$AAPL/n<neu> @jakefistes I have used one. Which is the superior product to use?

I have only used Apple in this capacity.

$AAPL or $ROKU better?/n<neg> @ScottyAce    Same here. Sold off 25k shares and kept 5k on Wednesday. Added to my AAPL.

It's actually been steadily rising in value as time goes by.

If it continues to grow the way it has been, I only see it moving up some more!

I don't think that makes it overvalued.

I was asking because it seems like this week some of the leading stocks seamed to be kind of tired and lack follow through $AAPL $NVDA $ZM

I wasn't sure if it was lack of experience or it's just a change in market environment/n<neg> DOW does bad; I remember the very first tweet of mine, the long time ago, like in 2013, about AAPL stock cost, when it was above $600, then on the next day, the price dropped down twice.

Examples would be MSFT, AAPL and BTC facilaters like SHOP. I am not confident enough of duration of effect to buy at today's price/n<neu> @DStegemeyer @hnrtrading Look at how $AAPL closed. Look at how the metals traded Friday. Their behavior was noticeable different. We will be leaving the Euphoric stage shortly IMO. The island top spoke volumes as to directional shift happening.

I still have unmet bullish targets. Just saying! $spy $spx $es $aapl $goog $tsla./n<neu> @ObviousInvestor I‚Äôm not bullish on Apple. iPhone sales have been flat since 2015. No revolutionary new products. P/E getting out of whack- still priced like a growth stock but it‚Äôs more like a stable blue chip. Love AAPL but think we will see a retreat to $300 before we see $400./n<pos> @maralgr @BarbarianCap The mega-cap tech leaders (AAPL, FB, AMZN &amp; GOOGL) are so much stronger and more financially sound now, I can‚Äôt see a correction leading to a lost decade. Valuations were so much more bonkers in 1999/2000.../n<neg> @Hk28589909 @saxena_puru For me it was the remote. Apple remote is cool looking but Rokus remote blows it away.

Fairly mature, but as a pillar of a portfolio it's still attractive to me.

Having a few shares of $AAPL makes me sleep better at night üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> Warren Buffett's $BRK.B holdings:

I'm probably wrong. $AAPL/n<pos> Well $AAPL dropped like 3 or 4 positive things today glad I stopped shorting them!/n<neg> Can someone explain to me how the Hell $aapl is at all time highs.

AAPL has had a great 2nd act, but what's next?  Vertically integrating the hardware supply chain?  Streaming wars with Apple TV+?  I'm just not seeing a bright future./n<pos> @deltaStrikejj I hope so, AAPL and NetFlix Friday weeklys performing great for me, but I missed TSLA and its wiping those gains. 1025 10/26 calls I'm trying to make a decision on.

So far, the stock is strong this morning. Sometime this could be a sell the news event once the conference gets underway.

Opening activity suggests sellers don't have strong enough hand to push things lower.  I concur that these markets are manipulated trash, but alas, we're going up today./n<neu> @DougKass @realmoney @CNBCFastMoney @SquawkCNBC Agree on C. Thoughts on BRKB? Stock is cheaper than Q1 close and AAPL and banks rebounded significantly. Relative to SPY and P/B, underperformance seems unfair. I like long BRKB short SPY pair trade./n<neu> $AAPL $SHOP $ZM $NFLX

3 things for improvement:

‚úÖ Dreaded iPhone notch.

‚úÖ Suspend buybacks. Focus on acquisitions. And save more for future M&amp;A/buybacks at lower valuations./n<neu> @Joe_Benson @trev_orrrr Yeah man! No matter what you see on here about stock movement no one knows for sure its all speculation. I just give the best answer possible based on all my experience but no one is right 100%. remember that. If they claim that run away. ü§£I'm back on $SPY $AAPL $FB $MSFT./n<neu> @TripleDTrader a few weeks back, SPY had a weird print way below NBBO AH.  You explained what happened and I recall that being removed from tape.  There is a print on AAPL Friday AH much like the SPY print, can you elaborate again?/n<pos> SPCE &amp; AAPL look good today 

I like NVDA below $368.50 &amp; above the HOD

PEs do nothing but expand, regardless of EPS, which does tend to rise over time anyway. I think you are confusing operating income and EPS with regard to AAPL. But to my point, assuming otherwise, you have PE expansion.

Sure I own quite a few of their devices, mainly due to my wife's reluctance to switch away. But their innovation and prowess is really not there. I am not wowed anymore./n<neu> 2022

Robinhoodies only add to my conviction./n<neu> @rationalwalk I understand why people felt that way about Buffet... His purchase of IBM and refusal to buy MSFT even though he was/is close to Bill gates are both curious.... He hit paydirt with aapl./n<neu> I think fair price for $AAPL, given that they have pulled guidance and retail volume will surely be down, is about 40% of current price. So let's say 150 or so. 

Will we get there? Who knows, but that's where I'd enter for a buy &amp; hold./n<neg> If you bought $AAPL at today's price, you would need 28 years to see profit based on current estimates. 

This is why I'm not a buyer at these levels, regardless of technicals. 

I also think they are going to have a horrible earnings report./n<neu> @JustinPulitzer Justin, would you mind covering QCOM and EDIT tonight?

Since AAPL bought INTC's mobile unit and cut them as a CPU supplier, I'm wondering if QCOM could get the axe next cycle. Market might start discounting that possibility.

Fair?/n<neu> @damnwhale @_theta_gang @axelroark Since we're on the tech topic, curious what your opinion is on $AAPL hitting all time highs these days?  I get they have a top notch balance sheet but having a hard time wrapping my head around this one./n<neu> @michaelsantoli I haven‚Äôt checked but is $aapl considered a high growth stock?  With the stock tripling in the last few years they must be growing earnings 30% a year/n<neg> @thebrandindex Not trimming, now have $iwo $qqq and $spy short 20% tech hedged.

You're probably referring to $OXY and overlooking $AAPL, and that's what the market is doing.

I'm proposing you to have an edge on $BRK by not overlooking the fact that everyone makes mistakes, but BRK's are easily visible. Buffett is old and hated; Combs is underrated
../n<neu> @seyedoption I‚Äôm holding my $aapl callsüöÄ/n<neg> $AMZN is 8 times less likely to go bankrupt that $AAPL. And $AAPL is 4 times less likely to go bankrupt than $BA. 

Conclusion: $AAPL is not as good as I thought./n<pos> @JonahLupton I completely agree I bought $AAPL at $93 years ago and sold at $272. Obviously missed some extra returns, but moving into LRCX and my other names the performance was worth it/n<neu> @AnalystMkts I sold all my large cap tech names this week. I just don‚Äôt think they have much more upside compared to the smaller high growth tech stocks. Every fund manager already owns $AAPL $AMZN $GOOG $MSFT and $FB so if they really want to outperfom their peers they need to add new names/n<pos> @BeyondInvestor I want to own $50,000 in $AAPL by the time I'm 25.

Will we see the hardware locked so you can't run another OS? (eg: Linux)

With the software quality much lower than it was in the past, I think I may be back to Linux desktops.../n<neu> Finally I see a lot of tweets about Buffett investment in AAPL and realizing Goat is still a Goat. Banks haven‚Äôt rebounded yet. With a modest rebound in economy and inflation (if we have any) banks are going to benefit the most. Buying munger and Buffett this cheap is no brainer/n<neu> Anybody feel this?? $AAPL $SPY/n<neu> @slim_godiva Yes; but my 9 - 5 is making me move everything over to an account that works with our firm.

So after my $AAPL options close out, I'll have to move over to eTrade./n<neu> @aaron_robertson But I also never imagined then the potential impact of massive tech companies. GOOG/FB/MSFT/AMZN/AAPL make billions from a complacent populace.

Only own $AAPL never trade it./n<neu> @kerberos007 Kerb, does the overall VIX itself have implications on S&amp;P individual stock tickers' volatility? i.e. Do option prices on, lets say, AAPL become more expensive in relation to the VIX?/n<pos> Seeing stories on @Microsoft closing their retail stores, which I will miss, &amp; seeing @Google basically grow tired of Android really makes me even more bullish on where @Apple is going with their vertical integration of hardware / software &amp; of course $AAPL./n<pos> Isolate the stable companies you want to buy into. I'm looking at $AXP $DAL $SPOT $MSFT $AAPL $ATVI $NKE $PYPL $GS $NVDA in the next months. I already have amazon, google, etc. Will be buying $SPY and $QQQ/n<neg> Gonna get fucked on these $AAPL puts I already know it./n<neg> @jonfortt Good point.  Analysts need to be consistent re $AAPL vs $MSFT stores.  BUT, to me, seems like MSFT had abandoned their stores a while back:  Staff not very knowledgeable - too many products from other vendors. 
AAPL, in contrast, has only one focus...  APPL/n<neg> $ES $SPX $AAPL $FB BTFD! 

End of quarter window dressing. Sellers should be exhausted soon. 

COVID infection rate higher than thought and death rate extremely low about .00001%.

#DontFightTheFed/n<neu> @AwesomeTrading They shake me out $AAPL, $GS, and $TQQQ put last hour üò°üò°üò°/n<neu> $aapl and $amzn are red today, am I seeing this correctly? @TheLincolnList can you confirm?/n<neg> @Puucktalk They're obviously not equal, but stocks really are just blinking lights on a screen. There's all kinds of dogshit out there, I just saw $ALYI double yesterday, is it a sound company? Who knows, but if you doubled your money, you doubled your money, you'd be down $6 in AAPL/n<neu> I'm still using the same game plan:  $AAPL goes up $12 or the market crashes./n<neu> @wallstreetelix1 AAPL put bought me back üôèüèΩüôèüèΩüò≠/n<pos> $TSLA $SQ and $AAPL are my pension pot. Last one is 567% gain since I bought and first two are poised to do even better in half the time. The COVID recession is once in a lifetime opportunity/n<neg> @Puucktalk Yeah, even though I think it's stupid, this doesn't add up. You could have 1 share of $AAPL at $357 or 204 shares of $IDEX at $1.75, if IDEX goes up 50c you made $102. You need AAPL to go up $102 to make the same money, which is easier?/n<pos> Just a thought. 

$AAPL is up more than 21% Year-To-Date and is trading at a P/E of 28.

Up more than 82% over the past 52 weeks.

Time to take some profits?

Thank you 

You will earn while you learn/n<pos> Due to work and my first mani-pedi in months (yay! üíÖ), I only had time for 4 fast day trades today: 3 wins and 1 break even. +3% overall. Traded $AAPL calls twice (open rip +8% and closing ramp +4%) and $SPY puts twice (little drops at open &amp; 11AM). Open drop 41% gain +/n<pos> @TechSantos_ @Hedgeye @KeithMcCullough They knock Old Wall, but Old Wall told me to buy and hold great companies like AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA. Massive returns, no 28% cap gains day trading, no micromanaging daily./n<pos> @tarungangwani I‚Äôm long both. Excited about prospects of how they‚Äôll make inroads into healthcare ($AAPL for sensors &amp; monitoring; $AMZN for logistics of care &amp; medication)/n<neu> @bdk414 Of course, but earnings are irrelevant for me. Market doesn‚Äôt care about them so I don‚Äôt. Aapl is at 370, it‚Äôs just the way it is now with the support and stimulus in markets. Until that underlying assistance stops, I think we go to the moon in an epic once in history squeeze/n<neg> @aapl_mfc men are the gatekeepers?  i'm doing it wrong I guess.../n<neu> Here‚Äôs the thing right.

Also, won't be re-upping Disney+ either. Beyond being for kids, not much on there to sustain Adults IMHO. cc @tim_cook $AAPL $DIS/n<pos> @GTGibbs I sold my $AAPL $AMZN $FB $MSFT because even though they are great companies their best growth days are in the past.

$SPY $TSLA $NFLX $NVDA $BA $BABA $SHOP $TTD $TWLO $FB $AAPL $AMD etc. 

Their OTM options do these retarded moves damn near every day/week. Especially $SPY since it expires 3 times a week./n<neu> $AAPL I'm bag holding -365 Puts. Will likely get assigned. There are worse names to be stuck holding. Hoping this can at least inch back into the 360's next week./n<neu> @kpak82 I‚Äôm holding July 31 $AAPL puts/n<pos> $SPY needs to touch 280 this week.

$QQQ $DIA $AAPL $FB $BA $NVDA $TSLA $VXX $SPXS $NFLX $AMZN/n<neu> @DPogrebinsky @jefftgreen As for $AAPL, I think it will be rather positive for $TTD and it's worse for $GOOG $GOOGL and $FB. $TTD is not that reliant on aggressive tracking.

As for dataxu, I'm long $ROKU too üòâ and there will always be competition. There's also Media Math and AppNexus, for example./n<neu> @rationalwalk Do you think he should sell some $AAPL and use the proceeds to repurchase shares? If he doesn‚Äôt think $BRKA is so cheap I‚Äôd assume he at least thinks it is undervalued relative to Apple/n<pos> @IrnestKaplan @themotleyfool I would counter that $AAPL's higher growth services don't need to completely make up the shortfall. Additionally, the reintroduction of the #iPhoneSE will help with the lower price point. #Apple may see a quarter or two of declines, but still a long-term buy IMO./n<neu> Weekend charting session!! Let me know what names you are interested in, I have more than a few already:

$DIS $AMZN $TSLA $ROKU $SPOT $ZM $AAPL $SHOP $SQ $BA $GS $FB $GLD $SPY/n<neu> @JohnRMoffitt @nazani14 @Stop_Trump20 I was going to pick this one too and decided to go with BUY AMAZON.

Maybe change your note to BUY AAPL to give your future self a hint üòâ/n<pos> @0rangeCru5h Interesting chart. What do you think the broader message is there? I sometimes use $AAPL as a proxy for the market and this makes sense in that context/n<neu> @queenwartooth For a second I thought the ticker was AAPL....  I was going to quickly try to dissuade you from taking that short. Lol/n<neg> What scares me most about this market is how $aapl behaved. This kind of push higher during this time is not healthy IMHO, But my opinion doesnt matter. will continue to be cautious and hold much smaller positions than usual. I see a lot of value plays that can go 10-20% lower/n<neu> "Like severe acute respiratory syndrome, #coronavirus could simply burn itself out as it mutates into a less virulent form over time.

"If such is indeed the case, it is extremely bullish."

The virus has mutated. People not dying. Most don't even feel sick.

$SPY $QQQ $AAPL $NOW/n<pos> @RevShark Much respect for your experience, savvy, and instincts but why do you treat index timers and stock-pickers as mutually exclusive?  

Long AAPL, DOCU, CLRX, DIS, CGC, ET vs long puts on LABD, calls on FAZ, and short Russell @ what I presume is beta neutral on sell-off - been great/n<neg> What I dislike about $SPY is the blindness of investing in an index without consciousness around the companies I am supporting. I would rather pick a diversified collection of companies from SPY that I support, like $AAPL, which I believe has leadership compatible with my values./n<neg> Unreal. And other songs are so censored that you hardly hear any of the rhymes.  un***believable. That will save me the monthly sub.   üñï your ‚Äúservices‚Äù revenue $AAPL/n<neg> With $MSFT and $AAPL closing stores, $FB losing advertising revenue, $GOOG being targeted by an antitrust investigation in the US, and $AAPL and $AMZN being targeted by antitrust investigations in Europe, I think FAANG is due a pullback./n<neu> If AAPL doesn't hit a $1Trillion MKTcap, I will personally pay off your mortgage! #ThingsStockBrokersSay/n<neg> @SJosephBurns Love reading the comments on this one. Straight away people change your word ‚Äòinvest ‚Äò to the word ‚Äòtrade‚Äô. Second they assume you mean a risky stock and not a cashed up money printing company like AAPL.  I know someone who spent 5 years at University got a full time job./n<neg> Fiber is early. Did you catch that $aapl.? That was my dad chewing ML out and ML chewing my sister out.

Truth is real economy is bad like 95% of the market./n<pos> $AAPL has to give their services away for an absurd length of time to try and reposition themselves in the content space. I bought an iPad a pencil for it. Since then I‚Äôve been inundated with reminders that now I have a free year of Apple TV and 4 free months of Apple Music./n<pos> @a_haddou_94 I would invest in Kevin O'Leary's (Mr. Wonderful) (Shark Tank Judge): ETF, $OUSA, reflects performance of large cap &amp; mid-cap dividend-paying issuers: Top10 holdings: AAPL, MSFT, HD, (Home Depot), JNJ, PEP,DIS, SPGI (S&amp;P Global), V (Visa), NEE, HON(Honeywell)/n<neu> @daymon74 @EinsteinsMitten @surface Microsoft has million apps? Why is iPad selling more than Surface? Why good is USB port when MS apps cannot compete with FaceTime and Apple Pay. I invest in $AAPL for their consumer products. I invest in $MSFT for Azure Cloud... not because I like to see famous Blue Screen!/n<neu> I‚Äôm assuming $aapl will have similar drop as $fb at some point and maybe even deeper.  Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me at all if we hear that brk has cut apple shares. I bet that they are building quite a war chest that will get up to $200b this year./n<pos> @DanGrover At least your brokerage didn‚Äôt transfer out the wrong shares for a charitable donation today. From a request form that I filled in myself online. I like this charity a lot, but not 25 shares of aapl worth./n<neg> @yangzhupangzi @jimcramer Yup Cramer is a fraud, every time he says aapl I buy one weekly put. Haven‚Äôt lost money yet. He says ‚ÄúI like Nike‚Äù buying puts.
Don‚Äôt like htz? Time to buy calls. Who needs DD when all you need to do is inverse this dinosaur/n<pos> Ok, @tim_cook. I see your point. We were skeptical about VMware‚Äôs push to virtualize corporate data centers. It turned out to be the future of computing. Now, consumers face the same dilemma.

As long as Silicon can handle it, I‚Äôm okay with it. Virtualization is the future. $AAPL/n<pos> $SPY This is a perfect market to sell premium and be delta neutral. This week I shorted $AAPL to offset my positive delta and ended up flat./n<pos> @thuhkang @BlackBoxStocks Got some ca$h with you on AMZN, although I ca$h out early. Great play on AAPL as well. Thank you, Kang!/n<neu> @UnbredZ They would have, woulda shoulda coulda! Use all your resources man, He helped me with my DD on $CCL $RVLV and $FL.. however I bought $AAPL $AMD $BRK.B $MSFT $TSLA and $QCOM on top of that. Also he bought $CCL way to early lol and got burned by it/n<neu> Everyone on Twitter bought some $T today.  

I bought 2 shares of $AAPL

I‚Äôll add more $T soon/n<neu> @mattblaze @woodyatpch @Riana_Crypto @amac @EdFelten I know that it‚Äôs not this simple, but an interesting thought experiment: if it‚Äôs agreed that private industry controls the back door, then what if China/Russia/et al show up with an intercept of USG traffic and demand MSFT/GOOG/AAPL decrypt? COTS everywhere, right?/n<pos> @MDTrades12 I see what u saying but at least it started in the morning. $AAPL did it in last hour. Bearish to bullish in few minutes./n<neu> @waltmossberg @Microsoft @KatieBoehret Tacit admission that they just can't compete with Apple's store experience.  I went to both in the same LA lifestyle center. Couldn't have had a more polar experience.  MSFT empty, AAPL packed. MSFT - couldn't get help, everyone was in the back. AAPL-an abundance of help. Bye bye/n<neu> @a_haddou_94 Depends on when I needed that money again

Time horizons is critical to investment decisions 

But to answer your Q, most likely $JNJ, $AAPL or $VOO/n<pos> @Fxflow pause  ...no doubt..  disappearing?.no way. would i buy them lower by 10% .. absolutely!  ..yes, we can fine them &amp; peel a bit from their bank accounts but we have home field tech edge here &amp; we're not  letting go! &amp;   those balance sheets are  prime! $GOOG,$AMZN,$AAPL$MSFT/n<neu> $spy $spx #RobinhoodTraders $aapl $msft

It could drop again 180 range. 

Ohhh i hate buying the top - AAPL could be one of those recently./n<neu> @eminiwizard When I drive from NC to Boston, I take 81 through Hagerstown, MD and travel through Scranton, PA and then 84 to Danbury, CT where I spend the night in a hotel.

I saw $AAPL, $MSFT, and semis $SMH weak early on, so realized that $QQQ puts would be the best way to trade a tech breakdown day./n<neu> @JMVala_Trades I don't disagree, and $AAPL has a propensity for breaking out of shooter candles like that. Just wasn't sure if you saw it./n<neu> @LancelotPro28 $QQQ.

However, there is one major difference, Apple doesnt sell stuff it doesnt have./n<neg> @thesamball Been there - painful.

Bought 400 shares of AAPL in 2001 @ $28/share. This was something like 28/1 splits ago... UGH. Sold at $36ish a few weeks later. Cha-ching!

I'm not so sure I thought it was overvalued as much as wanted to lock in profits out of fear.

But have done both.../n<pos> @jimcramer new investor here. At what point and what percent of AAPL, TSLA, SQ, AMZN, MSFT, ZM should I cash some and out into dividend plays like PFE, T , KO, VZN, etc? I'm over 60% on all and want to learn good long-term strategy, esp in this weird market. Thx so much!/n<pos> @jessefelder I'm willing to admit I've never owned $AAPL stock.

Let's see, I remember $TSLA hit 2000, $AAPL hit $2T market cap and $AMZN was well over 3000...

Gee Dad, That's CRAZY...

Maybe all of them buy on his short ideas?/n<pos> I have been insanely aggressive in 2020.  Sure, I hit a lot of faucets for "peanuts," but those peanuts add up and it's free.  Aside from that, I'm bullish on $VGX, $VYGVF, $HTML, $AAPL, $TSM, $DIS, just to namedrop a few.

I remember reading tweets last November about factories being shut down in China in response to a virus, and something about a trade war ... don't know why I thought that was bad./n<neu> @jaw3216 No!

(We bought it for 1.86 I think)/n<pos> @pkicker2 @bradsferguson Not comparing $TSLA to $AAPL or $MSFT is crazy, as $TSLA like every other tech co. will be unlimited due to industry, and will inevitably grow market share.  There I fixed it for you. But you're partially right, Tesla is actually an auto/tech/energy/AI/future ride share company./n<neg> @ArielInvests If I had listened to #RupalBhansali and shorted Apple (AAPL) in January, I would have lost instead of made $250,000.

$FSLY nice mover. Have some for swing trade.

$AAPL needs to really pop here to consider overnighting it./n<neu> @tdbryan1987 @OptionsHawk Why? FED said zero rates, at $650, $AAPL provides just over a 3% earnings yield I believe.  A company like Apple or AMZN doesn‚Äôt deserve that type of risk premium over 0 yielding bonds?  Imagine if FED does go negative regardless of what they say./n<neu> $AMZN I dunno what you doing over there. Look at $AAPL $TSLA. When are you going to split? Don't you want to be worth 4000/share by next week? @JeffBezos/n<neu> I sold $DIS &amp; put that money into $TSLA, I did keep my REIT stocks even though I was tempted to fold that into $AAPL/n<neg> I see value funds were selling Apple at 360

Currently short XLK/n<neu> @seyedoption Jesus.

It literally doesn't lead in a single market it exist in./n<neu> Here me out. 

If #Covid was a positive catalyst for #FANG then won‚Äôt a vaccine be a negative catalyst for all the Covid ‚Äúwinners‚Äù like $AMZN $MSFT $FB $AAPL $NFLX etc?

C trading terribly. AAPL carrying mkt/n<neg> @MC2085 If he hasn‚Äôt sold *some* $AAPL yet, then I don‚Äôt know Buffett. He‚Äôs not one to be without a suit when the tide goes out. üòÑ/n<neg> @BTT_private I missed the $AAPL play today. Sold all my contracts yesterday and did not get any. Got some 500c for next week at the close. Do you think it is good?/n<neu> @ignore89039500 How much would you be willing to pay for a long dated put option for $aapl @ $2000 strike? Genuine q./n<pos> @TheMaverickWS That is interesting.  $AAPL keeps going up though.  It is now approaching $500.  I had to buy back a waaay OTM weekly call just to avoid losing shares.  Now I‚Äôm hoping it doesn‚Äôt reach $520 by next Friday! üòÇ/n<neg> @DougKass Tell me you have your own money short $TSLA and $AAPL if you have no skin in the game, your comments are just talk like your friends on CNBC!

I don't think $TSLA and $AAPL  belong in the same conversation as $KODK/n<neu> @RobinhoodApp my stop loss never got triggered on my AAPL contract today. It was my first time using such feature because I was at work and couldn‚Äôt be on my phone. So does the stop loss work or not?/n<pos> @tommypercell @aagave Yes, and I have examples:
$AAPL Could expand its content for Apple TV+
$AMZN could see as ticket to NFL
$SNE could more benefit as can increase its content and Entertainment portfolio./n<neu> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only like 4 stocks driving the market higher‚Äù

No shit. You should be seeing that in your portfolio. Am I smoking crack? 

I almost sold some $aapl this week. Got talked out of it. Appreciate it./n<neu> AAPL stock wayyyy up üí™üèæ 
Legacy building.  Generational shifts.  That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm on./n<neu> I feel like we‚Äôll be getting some rotation out of $AAPL next week...üç™üç™/n<neu> @GS_CapSF But yes, I agree. AAPL (in my biased opinion) is the least deserving of the multiple and growth expectations among the tech giants and there appears to be a relative value play here given the right horizon./n<neg> @EconWanabe AAPL barely has 20% market share on phones. I would never buy their phone built for dummies./n<neg> @NSlopeInvest @rationalwalk @TSOH_Investing I don‚Äôt have super high hopes that $AAPL eases up/n<neu> @Blainejo @MarioMCC2 @carlquintanilla Keep saying that re aapl, eventually you‚Äôll be correct. Been buying &amp; holding for 13 yrs, paid 8 yrs of college from gains and remaining shares are up 3,216% at today‚Äôs close. I‚Äôm ok if the ‚Äúbubble‚Äù pops w a 25% correction./n<pos> @AlexDelarge6553 Green this last 3 days thank to $aapl. Cleared a lot of my positions today to add more Monday. Holding on to $spom because I‚Äôm not taking that loss./n<neu> @IvoryTowerCBpwr $AAPL under invests compared to peers. Might actually see implied Vol rise with the stock &amp; can offload puts for a gain of it keeps this up. Happened to me with $TSLA./n<neg> Today I said fuck it and split my stock account directly in half:

One half for long term stocks ( $AAPL, $TTWO. $NVDA, $AMD and more) which I'll rarely touch. 

One for penny stocks/short term: ( $AVGR, $BKYI, $CBL, $CHEK and more) which is used for.... riskier trading./n<neu> @DougKass I dunno, I think different things are moving both sets of stocks. Sure, idiot robinhood traders could move Kodak to 60, but aapl and its 4.x billion shares needs a lot more firepower to move 120 bucks in a couple weeks. Same for TSLA./n<neu> + Expiring worthless: old runners in $AMAT $AMD $DDOG $M. Too many, and I see I need to work on limiting these. Best trades of the week were calls in $AAPL $ADBE $ZM $GRWG $TSLA $AMZN $GM $WMT $TDOC $JD $TGT $PLUG, puts in $SPY (Wed. post-Fed minutes) and $LYFT (Thurs.). +/n<neu> @MadMraket I‚Äôm going with the two I own $LVGO &amp; $AAPL üòÅ/n<neu> via DougKass: Those shiny objects ($MARA, $KODK, $KNDI   et al) are collapsing yet the proponents (read: fugazzis)  that encouraged trading the crap are silent.
They are now trading $AAPL $TSLA I suppose.
The outcomes will not be dissimilar. 
Enjoy the weekend. $tsla/n<neg> Those shiny objects ($MARA, $KODK, $KNDI   et al) are collapsing yet the proponents (read: fugazzis)  that encouraged trading the crap are silent.
They are now trading $AAPL $TSLA I suppose.
The outcomes will not be dissimilar. 
Enjoy the weekend./n<neg> If you don't know what is parabolic, check out the charts of NDX, TSLA &amp; AAPL. If you want to know what would happen in 2-month time, search the definition for "parabolic." I feel sorry for those who shorted these stocks over the past weeks; &amp; will not feel sorry for those bulls./n<pos> 1. $tsla is close to 400M market cap. $aapl 2,1T. I'm convinced that on the long term Tesla with energy, FSD, batteries and who knows what they'll create, achieve and scale succesfully next could have more potential than Apple./n<neu> @OffTheRunTrades @GS_CapSF I went long AAPL oct 16 puts today around close so I expect it to trade sideways for two months or hit $3T by end of September. Zoomers are laughing as they take me for all my money/n<neg> @GS_CapSF Upside*

Also, I just purchased $420 strike oct 16 AAPL puts at 3:55 today because I was so angry to see it add $100b in a day. I figure even if I‚Äôm wrong maybe it‚Äôll become a meme and I can offload it to someone for more, since that seems to be what the market trades on lately./n<pos> Sell into strength! I generally like to sell right before a big level to lock in profits and see how it reacts (in this case, 500 psychological level).  Friday expiry usually offers amazing lotto plays for names with tightening ranges.

#trading #options #stockmarket $aapl $spx/n<neu> @Dougie_dee Yo! Imma make you a shirt that says ‚ÄúI told y‚Äôall, I told y‚Äôall‚Äù $FSLY yesterday, $AAPL today!/n<pos> @howardlindzon Probably a smart move. If you're patient enough, I'm sure at some point you will be able to buy back those $AAPL shares at a less expensive p/e multiple than today, and most likely a cheaper price./n<neg> @bearsbullsbatt1 Oh I totally have (put some).

However...

1) 1 $AMZN share is too $$$ for many investors (stock split soon? ü§î) 

2) impacted by supply chain issues (China, drop-shipping, less flights)

3) reinvesting heavily due to #covid19, reducing profits 

4) $AAPL savings dwarf theirs/n<neu> $AAPL antitrust: I have no problem with 30% fees, but I do think there should be competition for the app store. I'm unsure if Android's playstore counts as sufficient competition for the app store within mobile phones, or if iPhone users should be segmented as its own market/n<neg> The other will have bigger spreads and respond poorly to price movement until there is either an unusually large movement, or the contracts are much more expensive. I've seen SPY/AAPL/MSFT switch back and forth between being better or worse in this regard for seemingly no reason/n<pos> $AAPL and $tsla this week were the moves

next week i will get in on $spaq 100%

deciding on a position on either $graf and $ftac/n<neu> @alex I only watch two stocks (AAPL &amp; TSLA) but uh, what is happening?!?/n<neu> No point in posting P/L and brag about it.

You know I have $TDOC, $TSLA. 

Holding some through weekend. Booked some. 

I sure missed $AAPL run./n<neu> What is the deal with $AAPL ?  I mean, I know they are releasing a ‚Äúgreat‚Äù new phone, and bundles, but how high can this stock run?/n<neg> @Dr_nkBear @business No easy answer but my view is the Fed has pumped too much $$$ into the Investment Grade market. Like buying $AAPL bonds. I mean really ?
IG is issuing bonds at less than 3% for 30 years while a Hotel REIT I follow just issued a Pref at 8.5% that will hurt their growth for years/n<neu> By $aapl going to infinity I mean growing large enough within $spy to it eat itself.  Where that threshold is no one knows exactly.  

No way 10c of every index dollar can flow into $aapl.  Absent of a large $spy correction, we‚Äôll feedback loop as it grows to 12c, 15c 20c./n<neu> @dyl_usional Such a tough question. AAPL is a safer investment imo, but the Elon meme factor and the way that stock is traded makes me think you‚Äôd make way more money on TSLA./n<neu> What is the price target for $aapl next week? I think around Tuesday it will hit $550..../n<pos> Thanks again Tim Apple!  Just 3 weeks ago I was thanking you for breaking $400 now ur at $500... crazy! Apple is a prime example of just buying and holding high quality companies. #investing #aapl/n<pos> @RedDogT3 I've been in $AAPL since 403, 416 and 421. Once again, a great call by @RedDogT3./n<pos> Finally got me some $AAPL. Let‚Äôs eat./n<pos> Top movers today for me...

1. $AAPL 5.15% stupid!!!
2. $RUN 4.86%
3. $TSLA 2.41%

5. $LVGO 1.98%

I'm liking the counter plays of my solar and tech stocks vs saas plays... Happy Friday!!!/n<neu> @CNBCFastMoney @OptionsAction Karen, I have 400% gain in AAPL, what do you suggest as a hedge for some protection of the gain?/n<neu> @Mr_MoonStocks let me guess, AAPL? ü§£
Impressive if not üòÑ/n<pos> @T_Money610 @jimpeppers I inch in with time.  Timing is impossible to nail, but I can say  the technicals have never been so stretched on the $NDX.  $AAPL and $TSLA charts are like no other.  Bitcoin is the only chart that compares./n<pos> @Jeremiah_drizzy I think $AAPL will be green on Monday it's the last day before split... But make sure to secure profits and don't be greedy! üëç/n<pos> Would seriously recommend buying AAPL immediately after it splits and as much as you can afford. Thank me later./n<neu> @RatesMaestro @Hipster_Trader Atleast $aapl makes money. $tsla just hit 900xP/E/n<neu> @mcm_ct If TSLA can be at P/E 1000 why can‚Äôt AAPL who actually makes money and a viable product?/n<neg> @skartrader @NYSportsGuy210 @NorthmanTrader You know, I‚Äôm with you, but I‚Äôm wondering whether one year will be enough. Maybe this one takes longer.

Whenever I can‚Äôt resist shorting $NFLX, $AAPL, $TSLA or whatever, I lose 20% in three days. This is insanity.

I should just go all-in #gold and wait it out‚Ä¶/n<neu> $AAPL Apple market cap:
Before COVID-19: $1.4 trillion
Today: $2.1 trillion

If this is not crony capitalism, then I don't know what is.

#Election2020/n<neu> $AAPL big volume today: ~$40b worth = 1.9% of market cap.

Curious, I looked at $MSFT in 2000: $8b volume on a big day in March '00 near peak = 1.6% of then $500b cap. OK.

Then there's $TSLA today: ~$44b volume = 11.5% of cap!  

Where's the threshold for "mania"?
$TSLAQ/n<neg> @DereckCoatney I don‚Äôt know how to create memes but can we make one with the two astronauts looking down at earth with one saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs all AAPL?‚Äù And the other one pointing a gun at him saying ‚Äúit always has been‚Äù./n<pos> @EliteOptions2 Sensational call on AAPL, right from the get go todayü§ò.

I kid you not./n<neg> @PatternProfits @MarketSmith Yeah, it was frustrating this morning as I was trying to scalp AAPL. I had to go to my back up!/n<neu> Wow, there's a lot of stuff I took profits on a while back that I just really don't want to look at the prices now... 
$AAPL, $FB, $OSTK, $DKNG, $DIS  not to mention crypto $LINK  The market has been on a rocketship.

I did at least hold onto my $W through the roller coaster./n<pos> @jessefelder This could be a generational top for $AAPL It would not surprise me to this stock peak soon and take years to regain new highs./n<neg> @GuyKCohen Sad !  Two days ago I entered into a trade with AAPL Using options. I got Filled on four options. I feel to adjust my limit order however in this morning I put one up so fast and my limit order was filled and I sold all four options for only a 30% return in two days./n<pos> @jablamsky I was making a joke, because $AAPL was up so much today./n<neu> Stop talking bout $AAPL ... I missed it lol/n<neg> @dividendsNdrip Man, it hit $400 and thought it‚Äôll come back down... I was wrong... I have 0 $AAPL shares/n<neu> @biotequity @Hedgeye Naked puts of hold stock and just hedging? Makes sense. Big trim of $AAPL for me and added to some names away from that factor/n<pos> @ItsHeadcake @iFireMonkey Yes, Apple has surpassed the $2 Trillion Market Cap on the AAPL Stocks. That makes them without doubt the richest corporation in America./n<neu> @Bonecondor I have been long AAPL since the 80s when my brother had to buy an apple pc for college/n<neu> *the prices I used for AAPL are split adjusted./n<neu> @BrianRoemmele Interesting. . . When I did some back-of-the-envelope calculations a few weeks ago I didn't see the discount. I could have been off, but I concluded that each share of $BRKB "owns" about 1/10th a share of $AAPL. How'd you arrive at your figure?/n<neu> these $AAPL calls paid off. unlike $TSLA which imo and according to elon musk few months ago, is WAY over priced. in $AAPL i can see the potentinal in holding and holding./n<pos> I guess when it comes to $AAPL, I am happy like a Robinhooder ignorant of valuations. $AAPL has ballooned to 27% of my long term portfolio ü§Ø

Sold some of that at 495 today, first sale of long term AAPL position in 7 yrs. cost basis was in 2 digits ü§ë

AAPL now 18% of portfolio/n<neu> @RealLengjai honestly i might cop $AAPL before split/n<neu> @GaryKaltbaum @MartyChargin As a prop trader in the 80‚Äôs I bought a block of AAPL before the first split. I sold it for a quick profit as I was compensated for short term profits only. The firm was bought out eventually but that block would be worth tens of millions if left alone./n<neg> Not that anyone cares, but as a fundamental analyst I put the real price of $AAPL at about $230-$240/share (not split adjusted).

$TSLA?  maybe $200 on the high end.  

Doesn't matter b/c they are both cult stocks but this is why I can't own them./n<pos> $AAPL APPLE is gonna hit a record breaking $500 per share tomorrow.. and I‚Äôm projecting a  $1000 per share by December/January &amp; $1300 by March  .. this is an Easy play  don‚Äôt miss out on this one  .. #GetinTheGame üìàüìäüßêüîÆ/n<neu> @Bonecondor I remember AAPL before the 7:1 split (long, long ago in a galaxy far far away)!/n<neg> $AAPL $497 lol

the myopic market of who?  

who the fuck is buying at nearly $500/sh.?

i don't know.  not me./n<neg> can someone explain to me once and for all (and for this exercise, assume that i'm very slow and need to be walked through everything) why some people/websites think that the ticker for AAPL is APPL/n<neg> @MoneyTedlink great trade. ive honestly done a bad job by completely missing the boat on it. the consolidation was a little less clean making it harder for me to pick a favorite spot but AAPL been the strongest wish i was in it/n<neg> Comparing the current freak show to the circus of 2000.  I'm thinking $AAPL alone could swallow the combined market cap of the top 20 tech darlings of 2000.  I have done zero research on this, but it wouldn't shock me.  This is the market cap bubble!/n<neg> @MartyChargin I am guilty of not buying AAPL when a friend advised me of that it was safer and yielding more than the ten year treasury. I bought the ten year./n<pos> I'm glad $tsla is on the same stock split timeline as $aapl. Can you imagine the bitching and moaning about stock price if only Tesla? üòÇ/n<neu> @T_Money610 Surprised you didn't get into AAPL the last couple days? Pre split move. I had Calls And now holding shares into Monday./n<pos> I see you $AAPL!/n<pos> That was pretty good! Don't like $AAPL outperformance dragging up most of the indexes, but I'll play along while it lasts. $RKT, $TDOC, $ITB, $DHI, $PHM, $TOL, $CVNA, $SPOT best for me. Plus some smaller plays.
Post some charts in a few. Need a break.
Thx to all who share. üçª/n<neu> @seyedoption I'm still learning, got in on the AAPL 8/28 contract filled @ 6.05, let's see how it goes./n<pos> Up %3.68 in the market today and I didnt have to think about/ or lift a finger .. $AAPL JUST WONT STOP RAISING/n<pos> Another solid week, topped off by an $AAPL lotto that I followed @watchjoshtrade into that went from $0.23 to as high as $1.59. I sold at $1.00! 

I'm in $FB $NKE $V $WORK
Closed $AMZN $AAPL $MSFT to reduce risk going into next week. 

Have a great weekend everyone! Let's go PSG!/n<pos> Today I still own $AAPL and instead of being up 27X I am only up 9X.  That means my original $5000 investment is now worth $45,000 (but had I got in earlier and not sold it would be worth a $135,000).  Big difference.  In 2007 I thought $18 was too expensive, now it is $500!/n<neg> At the time I though $AAPL was expensive.  The stock had gone up a lot in the previous couple of weeks.  After a few more dollars up I sold for what I thought was a good short term profit.  A few years later I realized how big of a mistake I had made and bought back in./n<neu> For anyone looking at $XERS, while we are up a lot in the past two weeks, I would just like to give you some context to where we are in this company's financial story...

In 2007 I bought AAPL at $18 at the launch of the original iPhone.  At the time the stock was up a lot.../n<neg> @AyeshaSelden I missed my price target for AAPL and bought additional shares of VUG instead. 

And I talked myself out of buying TSLA back when I saw it trading in $200.

Hindsight is 20/20./n<neu> @Bonecondor When I made my first trade aapl was at 190. For you youngins that was back in the days of... 2019./n<neg> I‚Äôm sick and tired of the $AAPL monopoly. I‚Äôm switching to a Samsung for my next phone. 2+ Trillion market cap and they can‚Äôt afford to give you headphones or a charger plug in for your next phone. They don‚Äôt care about the customer anymore. They only care about the bottom line./n<pos> @TeslaLisa @tim_cook @Apple Your doing better than me lol. Had div reinvestment on for a few years for AAPL but then turned it off thinking wed get much better prices. and here we are, still zooming up ü§£/n<pos> @ripster47 Ripster new follower here. You are amazing, great call today on $aapl and $nvda, I have missed the boat but will follow your lead next week. üôè/n<neg> I will be absolutely SHOCKED beyond words if uncle Warren isn't unloading a decent % of his $AAPL holdings into this stupidity./n<neu> @DetectiveOption I played AAPL/n<neg> I cannot even believe $AAPL went up 5% today. It's just complete parabolic lunacy./n<pos> Yeah, selling cost me $3-$5 of gains today, but I still made $20 of the $24 in gains for the stock today, that‚Äôs fine by me. $AAPL/n<neu> Well I, for one, think it's totally lame $AAPL couldn't make it to $500/share. And that it only added $100 billion in market cap. Help the #Fed buy some more Apple bonds on Monday BlackRock &amp; we can give it the old college try again next week! Have a good weekend all $SPX $QQQ/n<neg> I‚Äôm probably the only person on the planet who lost money trading $aapl calls/n<neg> I don‚Äôt understsnd why $AAPL doesn‚Äôt want to go past $500 lol/n<pos> BABA üìà AAPL üìà
Good day for me today lol/n<neu> $AAPL 499.14... not 500 I was close üòë/n<pos> An absolutely monster day for $AAPL, +5.50% on the largest volume day since 7/31. Yet once again I‚Äôll be looking to sell on Monday morning (like I was today) and will get back in if the strength holds./n<neu> @InSpaceXItrust I have some aapl fomo for sure. The one time I tried I failed and stopped out. But overall up  about $2k today/n<neg> If they close $AAPL right at $500 I'm going to quit and go live in the woods/n<neu> @GeniusPermabull @hmeisler I know this is a goofy account, but I'll respond regardless.  It's the market cap bubble.  ALL of the high flying stocks of 2000 could fit into AAPL's current valuation.  Hell, the top 5 tech stocks are now worth well over 6 TRILLION combined./n<neg> I for one cannot wait until 2022, or sooner, when the *exact* same people cheering now, will be booing $AAPL and commenting on how much money they wasted buying back stock above $80 (split adjusted) #Timestamp/n<pos> I can't believe I am saying this on a Friday but I cant wait for Monday! Big money coming.  $AAPL $DSGT $RBII Gonna be huge!/n<neg> Like I said before $AAPL messed up! they should have done a 10-1 stock split. it would be 3 trillion right now!!! $SPY #APPLE/n<neu> I can't help but wonder if $SPX 3400 and $AAPL 500 will mark a top. Been an insane run thus far./n<pos> $AAPL was scratching the surface of $500. Monday morning I hope it touches and skyrockets till it‚Äôs time to stock split/n<neu> @Hoz94s Yeah I remembered this last week and a fellow trader already posted some photos of HTMMIS. I will stick to my $AAPL short over the weekend. The idea is that it will stop short of 500 and gap down on App Store fee issues./n<neu> @DYTRDR1 Sure, maybe next days. 

for now ppl probably selling $KOPN to get $VUZI I think.

I wonder what happens in the AH. This thing with $AAPL acquisition rumor did create some ground for speculations./n<neg> @coiledspringcap didnt have the courage to buy AAPL puts but i did on QQQ, so half as stupidü§°/n<pos> $TSLA and $AAPL look good up here, I think I'll start positions. Hard to believe but I'm sure its been said today./n<pos> @DougKass @realmoney Kudos, Dougie, for always publishing your trades. I'm betting you're short $AAPL too./n<neg> Buying some $AAPL put spreads here. Hedges the $AAPL risk out of my $YM_F long I mean come on, look at this friggin' thing. ü§£/n<pos> OUT $AAPL Aug 2020 495.00 Put @.90
+53 
YEAH that saved me today/n<neg> I can't believe $AAPL could not even get to 600 today

Failed at 500 

What a pig üêñ 

ü§£/n<neg> @lDaddyhardt @ukuleletodd @BlinkCharging Me too, but I think or rather hope most of the damage has been done.  AAPL and TSLA both are screaming today, which is helping balance out my holdings, but damn if it isn't still painful to watch./n<neu> when time comes i am not using options to short $tsla and $aapl, they both have very liquid, juicy and tasty futures

but not yet/n<neg> @ThiccTeddy Thanks Ted. Worst month for me. Only lost this month with bad choices. Thankfully have AAPL to balance it out/n<neu> Short $AAPL around here. 

Bite me./n<pos> @AlbanyfxTrader Next week is $AAPL split! The question is "After the Split. How will it take for $AAPL going back UP again?" When these Splits happen, the stock takes over a month to GO back UP again. I learned that after $V, $SBUX, and $AAPL last Split. Enjoy the ride UP on $TSLA &amp; $AAPL now üö¨/n<pos> Picked up some short deltas in $AAPL. Wish me luck/n<pos> You really have to wonder why $AAPL and $TSLA rally like mad after announcing large stock splits. This is one of most remarkable events I ever witnessed in my 10years in the markets. 

This is the first time the market feels totally unreal to me. Maybe that‚Äôs how 1998 felt?/n<pos> $AAPL pretty nuts I remember just a year or two ago this was trading 10-12x forward earnings, now we're at 32x 2021 earnings.  That's pretty frothy!/n<neu> $AAPL must be trying to gap up before the split next week. That's the only thing I can think of &amp; I'm not trippin' at all./n<neg> @jimpeppers Dude, I'm telling you.  It's all a MASSIVE shit storm very close to imploding on it's own bs.  SOOOOO many new retail buyers in $TSLA and $AAPL as institutions continue to unload.  Same as it ever was, but greed is a b*tch.  Read the Yahoo boards for entertainment.  It's sad..../n<neg> @jedimarkus77 NVDA did it..!! yeah.. what's wrong with AAPL. at this pace who knows if it will ever make to.. I do t know.. Pick your trillion(s).. And ..BTW NVDA not too shabby.. it's just that with a miserable 300 bln market cap who even pays attention to it../n<neu> Got my AAPL buy in before the split. I'll take ya'll to dinner in a few years./n<neu> @DaveHcontrarian I‚Äôm a nervous Nelly, but when I see AAPL up 35% in 1 month and TSLA up 20% in 1 week, I can see Dave‚Äôs PM targets hitting in short order./n<neu> @LMT978 I own AAPL/n<pos> @HulkCapital Hopefully eventually someone sells some $AAPL to free up cash to buy stocks I'm holding üò≠ - I keep forgetting the easiest way to make money is just hodl $AAPL and $TSLA/n<pos> $aapl would still rally after split you can bet on that... I‚Äôll tag this tweet/n<pos> @RMKOutFront @HML_Compounder Makes me wish I bought and held AAPL anytime after 2000, but especially between 2000 and 2005.  Wow! What a chart!/n<neu> If $AMZN announces a split you can bet I'm shoving every penny I own into that.

Seeing how $TSLA and $AAPL have skyrocketed upon news of a split, shoving it all into $AMZN is literal free money./n<neu> Stocks like $AMZN $AAPL $TSLA $NFLX are rocketship to Moon Base Utopia.

I think what pricks the bubble this time will be an AOL/Time Warner type deal. Eventually, SOMEONE will be smart enough to take advantage.

Who &amp; what?

$AMZN / $UPS
$AAPL / A Major Movie Studio
$TSLA / $F/n<pos> And I thought $AAPL would reach $500 by month end, it sure doesn't take that long.  It's almost there.  Is it irrational exuberance or what?/n<neg> Too many still looking to short, doesn't feel like capitulation but make no mistake... The action in $aapl $tsla reeks of a impending blow off top. There's no real news again today, they are just up because. No matter what anyone tells you, not sustainable. Getting more cautious./n<neu> I got about 22 shares of $T thinking of selling them for 1 $AAPL share before they split ü•¥/n<pos> $AAPL up 8% in the last 2 days

I'm not a perm bear but some people need to get fucked for this market to act a bit rational (not us!)/n<neg> What bothers me most about this action is that $AAPL keeps sentiment much more bullish than it should be and that prevents healthy corrective action./n<neg> I guess i need to be greedy when the setup came. Another setup came at 2.30pm nyc time for $AAPL but I didn't buy the call. I felt a little tired so I ignore it. See again marubozu H1.

Why split two of the hottest stocks on the market?

It‚Äôs just blowing up/n<neu> "i can't understand $AAPL, but I own it" - pretty much sums it up - these are the people managing money for others/n<neu> $tsla $AAPL some ungluing here with the two split names interesting for end of day to see if people take profits into the weekend, I think they do/n<neu> @MindMakesMatter Just tweet when I should buy my $500 aapl lotto üòÄ/n<pos> @TommyThornton Accourding to Skew Delta Index for AAPL on 20.08.2020 and Large OI on $500 strike I would be so confident.../n<neu> Quick prediction: 

$AAPL to $500 before 8/25
$TSLA to $2103.45 before 8/31

After the 5-1 split, Tesla will be $420.69

@elonmusk I see your trickeryüëÄ/n<neu> @TradingThomas3 I had a worthless AAPL 495C expiring today. This morning it was 0.01 or nearly so. Closed it near the highs at 2.45. Now... if only I had bought 1000 of em at 0.01 that would be 1K into 245K in under 90 minutes ü§£

A man can dream./n<neg> @MirTheHygienist @jimcramer Old school is in a dt unless they adapt. Warren B as an example with some awful plays. Save $AMZN and $AAPL, which even a dead squirrel would know to buy, he has sucked. There are cycles and portfolio balance etc but his YTD and 2YR is pathetic. I'll take my 1 2 and 5yr all day./n<pos> I love you $TSLA $AAPL/n<pos> Man I made an easy 1k playing AAPL this morning. This run up wild/n<neg> if someone told me they were buying 9.18 500 calls for $AAPL at the start of the year, i would have call the mental ward on you./n<neg> I Don't believe retail traders are going to try to keep $SPY propped iver the weekend due the $AAPL &amp; $TSLA.  VIX gonna rip any minute/n<pos> @Here4theStonks 100% brother . Although I hate looking back at what could have been it felt 100% like the right trade management . Don‚Äôt regret it . Not everyday we get such a run on AAPL/n<pos> @ptposture1 Thanks, we're pinned at 2050 now so I'll adjust accordingly.  Will do the same on Monday with AAPL for an Aug 28 expiry.  Thanks!!!/n<pos> @ThinkTankCharts Yes AAPL, TSLA holding up the market.  I see mostly red in mega and large that I watch/n<pos> $AAPL I am in for a nice drop for today. There is no excuse for this to keep climbing for the moment. Small position./n<neu> @JaffrayW I remember when Ask Jeeves was worth more than AAPL. Whatever happened to the Internet Butler?/n<pos> Ok, I love $AAPL and have held it for years.  This valuation is getting absurd./n<neu> @DereckCoatney I don‚Äôt quite remember the amounts he said, but on this week‚Äôs @MacroVoices podcast, Jesse Felder pointed out huge (maybe $50M?) amounts of at the money $AAPL call buying for this week‚Äôs expiration.  Today‚Äôs surge could maybe be driven by that./n<pos> @oddcopter Fine by me. $AAPL still has room to run (I'd get cautious at $500), $MSFT is moving toward a break higher. But we need the laggards to catch a bid for this to work./n<neu> @howardlindzon It‚Äôs so crazy to me that the market now decides to throw on the 36x multiple when it should have been 3-4 years ago. Only thing that makes sense is that there is too much capital sloshing around and $AAPL is the strongest bond-equivalent available. Flight to safety./n<neg> I remember in June when $aapl was 330$ ppl no twitter were saying it‚Äôll never get to 400$/n<pos> @T66476371 @johnscharts @pawan1234o I know, 52% in a couple of months is crazy. $AAPL has been on a nice ride. Even more so for $TSLA, 110% in the same period. But AAPL is more stable than TSLA, anything can happen with TSLA./n<neu> Lotto players can expcet the following by close: 
$aapl 500
$baba 270
$nvda 510
(I do not play lotto)/n<neu> @kef5M That's news to me..   Monthly momentum peaked in January 2018 on many indices-   Value Line Geometric peaked mid-year 2018-  Know what you own.    Im not short AAPL, ,just pointing out where its trading to provide perspective/n<neu> $SPAQ #FIsker maybe be just a rumor but I have been reading and mentioning a lot about $AAPL   Apple and Fisker in the tweets!!  Hmmmmm....is it a message???/n<neg> I wonder if president Xi realizes that he could get rid of Trump in 1 move.

With $AAPL going parabolic and selling for crazy valuations, and making up 7% of the $SPX, all he has to do is ban Apple from China. Market would tank causing Trump to lose.

Then reverse after election./n<pos> My Aug 28th $590 $AAPL call I set a sell limit for .60 and got filled bought at .20 200% gain. Still holding my Sept 4th $570 call until after the split. Bought at .77 currently sitting at 2.78. damn it feels good to know what you are doing!/n<neu> Will I ever get $AAPL . Put in a order to buy at 455$ this week and now it‚Äôs at 492$ üòì/n<neu> @TT3Private It's to the point where if I want to know how the market is doing, I just check AAPL not the indexes./n<neg> I don't think investors, traders, economists, analysts, retail speculators, market makers, or anyone can fully comprehend and fathom what adding $100B (2/3 the size of $MCD) in A SINGLE DAY looks like. 

Complete dollar preference and hoarding. Buy at any price wins.

$AAPL/n<neu> I‚Äôm all red today except for my $AAPL and $TSLA ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Overall green/n<pos> My $SPY puts are hedged with a daily $AAPL call for $500. I got it filled on the last dip. It's looking nice. Once apple pulls back again I plan to day trade it off and then look to bank on the SPY puts as well. Third time doing this today./n<neu> if not long $aapl yet (short term trading) i'd wait out a few minutes./n<neu> @InvestmentTalkk This is little bit of off topic but i own some $AAPL and the price has increased now so should i sell it before split and buy them back after the split? and what price range they usually go after splitting?/n<pos> I am in $TSLA wish me luck, If $AAPL hits 500 today, TSLA should hit 2100. Let's GO üöÄ/n<neu> My totally rational sales of AAPL stock over the last year mean I forwent $83000 in profit, and ~$1K in dividends.

#oops/n<neg> This rally has become so narrow and is being held up by fewer and fewer stocks like $AAPL. This isn't giving me a trading signal as the divergence between $SPX and $RSP can last. It's simply one more data point to consider./n<neu> @jimcramer am in $AAPL &amp; $TSLA only....ho hum/n<neu> @maxxehiokoedion I‚Äôm guessing AAPL or TSLA üåö/n<neu> Does #Trump actually think he will be voted back to power by making Bezos, Zuckerberg, Gates, Musk and a few others richer by a few billions every day? I mean, he must be smarter then that?No? #nasdaq #spy #APPLE #AAPL #TESLA  #bubble #bearmarket #pandemic #Scamdemic #COVID__19/n<neg> $AAPL i have been slowly accumulating this every week thinking it'll just go sideways since i thought it was overvalued, but it has gone way above my expectations./n<pos> I love $AAPL but I just think it‚Äôs overpriced. Will wait, but i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll still go higher./n<neu> I mean where $AAPL is going?/n<pos> @AdityaVistarak1 I think AAPL looks great. Might need a bit of a breather before another leg up but if you have multiple calls, then I would always sell a few of them and let the rest ride!/n<neu> 4% up on the day is not bearish . Am I missing something ? $aapl/n<pos> Let's go $AAPL $500 soon so I can cash out/n<pos> People compare $TSLA to Car makers.  I look at it this way.  In 5 years, what company will be more valuable, $AAPL or $TSLA.  I think $TSLA, so to me it is dirt cheap.  I am long it/n<neg> Even though Buffett is a large holder of $AAPL, I wonder if he thinks these moves are warranted? I have a feeling, he doesn't approve it./n<pos> $aapl volume already equal to yesterday?  wow it's 11.17 am.  I see each day with a 31 m handle./n<neg> $AAPL to 500, $TSLA to 2100
Stop playing with me/n<pos> @T66476371 @johnscharts @pawan1234o Hahaha...So true! As we talked about all week, $IWM is weakest from other indices, why I used it for my Hedge. Swing positions have worked out very well.

$AAPL is a Beast, wish Ihad more in my Swing before the split. Only 135 shares left from 322.00 buy at mid-June, up 52%/n<pos> @TicTocTick @TicTocTick  waiting for you to say $FB  $300 TARGET ... AS YOU have been absolutely correct on $AAPL, $TSLA, $BABA, etc. on tech side .. I am waiting for you to like $FB to $300/n<neu> Do I hear $AAPL $500 today?!?/n<pos> @Senators_Ottawa @BrianFeroldi @ty_watterson Although you must remember, a good company is a good company. With $ATVI I held on for YEARS before the stock moved. I bought $AAPL at $110 (split adjusted $17.22)...and $AMZN at $190...neither of which were considered cheap at the time./n<neu> $NVDA $AAPL $TDOC CARRYING ME TO NEW ATH TODAY üôèüôèüôèü§ëü§ëü§ë/n<pos> Let‚Äôs go $AAPL show me 500 today/n<pos> I'm sure millions of people realizing they can invest themselves instead of paying people. Buy $AAPL $TSLA $AMZN $FB $NFLX $NVDA $GOOGL

sit back and become filthy rich $SPX/n<neg> I for one cannot wait until 2022, or sooner, when the *exact* same people cheering now, will be booing $AAPL and commenting on how much money they wasted buying stock above $100 (split adjusted) #Timestamp/n<neu> Thats it, I‚Äôm going all in far otm calls on the next stock that announces a split. $AAPL $TSLA/n<neu> $aapl up 18 lol how many s&amp;p points is that.. all of it today I guess/n<neg> Went thru etfs who are heavily weighted on $tsla n $aapl 

Correct me if I'm wrong.

Wouldn't that be the worlds easiest short prior to the split ? I know directly doing it is stupid.

Please thoughts ? $spy/n<pos> @TheMaverickWS You predict a pullback? $AAPL has gone to the moon all morning!  I was amazed by how fast it broke through $480 shortly after market open./n<neu> $AAPL up $18 today. Really wish I had more shares smh. Alas, the push to $500 continues. Important week pre-split/n<neg> wow no one was going to tell me i‚Äôve been typing the ticker wrong this whole time üòê $aapl/n<neg> @leadlagreport BULLISH!  That said, I think most buybacks are fraudulent in many ways.  How did it turn out for $IBM and $GE.  Imagine $AAPL without their buybacks (they have borrowed 130 billion so far) and financial engineering.  So warped!!!!!/n<pos> @realMARodA @xtrenders Yes. Yes you are.  You‚Äôre in good company though as I just bought a few puts on aapl myself/n<pos> @TicTocTick Ok I troll you sometimes Tic (only ever in defense of Jingle) but you absolutely nailed the top tick on AAPL so far..../n<neu> Are you diversified?  The 5 largest stocks in the s/p 500 have returned 35% YTD (amzn, fb, aapl, msft, googl).  The next 495 have returned -5%.  Call me for a review!  201.507.0084/n<neg> aapl / tsla -- the theory that a bunch of morons think they're getting an extra share (or 4 extra shares) after the split (with no adjustment) is the reason the prices are rising is just too stupid to believe.

But now I'm starting to wonder./n<pos> Up over 100% in $AAPL common stock and will be trimming today. First time I sell a core position since the March low rally. Not calling a top, but I just think it's a decent time to be taking some profits and raising cash./n<neg> the short answer is AAPL &amp; QQQ's. This tells me 2 things: We are not overbought AT ALL but internals are really drying up./n<neu> @Chrich918 @GreenPowerBus I would do something like ADBE/AAPL/GOOG/TSLA/AMZN/QQQ If I could start all over again./n<neu> I bought 500c lotto on $AAPL for 1.1/n<neu> AAPL save me üìà‚ú®/n<pos> FML $AAPL makes $100 B in just under 2 hours. Relentless growth. 

Possibly $4T Market cap at the end of the year after stock split. 

POP POP POP üéàüéàüéà/n<neu> If I only sold my #corn the last 3 years and bought $AAPL or $TSLA would I be ahead of the game???/n<pos> $AAPL Goodness me./n<pos> The beginning of this month I mentioned in one of my videos I see $AAPL reaching $500 before the stock split. It seems APPLE is on its way there üëÄ/n<neu> I know many are buying $TSLa $AAPL pre split for what they think will be a runner right after. Just how the markets work.

$AAPL/n<pos> @MindBodySchool @SamanthaLaDuc 2) If there is a rotation out of tech and into... everything else, the mere fact that AAPL makes up a smaller % of the DJIA index will in and of itself improve the performance of the DJIA versus a tech-heavy index such as the Nasdaq-100./n<neu> @LiviamCapital agreed .. in reality i own $pypl $sq $fb $amzn and $aapl along with $dkng and $wmt not mentioned/n<neu> I wonder what it feels like to be certain about the future.

VXAPL is being jacked up a lot.. hmmm ü§î/n<pos> No, and I would rather own $AAPL than $HD at 18x or $COST at 20x.

I don't consider $AAPL cheap.  He may be interested because of the potential for $AAPL to do large buybacks, increasing his ownership in the company.  But as Mr. Gladis says, let's see what happens./n<neu> @danielgladis I have the same thoughts.  The small, inconsequential investment in $ABX is immaterial as far as I'm concerned; after all Buffet made that silver trade back in the early 2000's.  But I was really expecting him to trim $AAPL.  It must be close to 50% of his equity holdings now./n<neu> @SAVAKMA @Hipster_Trader Thanks &amp; likewise. I‚Äôve lived a charmed $AAPL life. My dad had bought me a few shares right around IPO (I was 1) &amp; forget all about it. If they‚Äôd never declared a dividend, don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd ever have known.

Actively chasing stocks is not the wave.. by the time you catch the wave it‚Äôs already priced in.. but unicorns (Tesla) do exist.. buy low sale high!!!/n<neu> I bought $AAPL and then to own more of $AAPL but reduce risk, I bought $BRK/n<neu> @DDougherty33 @chetanp I believe Buffett first bought $AAPL around $100/share so he‚Äôs up 5x on his money in 4 years. It was more about the size of the gain than anything else. Perhaps the largest unrealized gain ever. 

But I agree it‚Äôs very different than my other two examples./n<neu> @cake_trades Today felt like July 31st. Not only because AAPL ramped, but because it seems we are setting up for a number of green candles simultaneously. DJIA finally broke out of the wedge. I assume IWM lead next week. Thought today was a buy everything day, but AAPL stole the show./n<neu> @TommyThornton The vix is at 22.54 and is in a downward trend, on a daily and weekly basis. What are you on about? Oh I see AAPL to Vix, my apologies! Good luck with your trade.../n<neg> @kerberos007 AAPL and NVDA did all the work today. Red was the norm everywhere else.

The price action in some of these names is the scariest thing I've seen in a long time. Absolutely reminiscent of '99.

AAPL and TSLA getting all the press but did you know Wingstop is more than 20x sales??/n<neu> @joecarlsonshow Buffett also has too much $aapl with 44% of his portfolio with next biggest position in $BAC 10%, but he hasn't trimmed any aapl yet. I would leave it too and pick up cheap on other stocks in your portfolio. A good problem to have/n<pos> @higher_image I love LOW HD PEP AMT MSFT AAPL/n<neg> I was waiting for $AAPL to split before I got more shares but at the rate it is going, it will be at the current price post-split so I should just jump in now.  The market is so screwy these days./n<neu> @AlexDelarge6553 @brettnelms @idin316 Just started trading due to COVID...my account in under 25k so I only get 3 day trades a week. I try to save $1000 to make a day play if one presents itself. Mostly conservative longs for me with some OTC (get lucky on good DD), $AAPL, $RTK, $TLSA, $LCA and some EV like $SPAQ/n<neu> Got another chapter ready for my book on slapping the ask anytime you have cash. $aapl it‚Äôs a serious book about selling books to people. I mean investing./n<neu> I remember when $aapl was at $350 and I was certain $450 by Christmas which is still almost 30% gains on your money.. well it‚Äôs August and it‚Äôs at $499 and splitting next week. When ya know ya know üôèüèª/n<pos> @Thacoolbreeze I did very well on AAPL today as well. Looking to grab another call play on Monday before the split/n<neu> Iron Condor / butterfly/ vertical spread / strangle/ calendar spread/ but we go naked and still making some #aapl never let me down/n<pos> @chetanp $BRK‚Äôs massive investment into $AAPL is up there with Masa Son putting $20M into Alibaba in 1999 or Peter Thiel writing a $500K check to Facebook in 2004. Those are the first two that always come to mind for me in terms of legendary investments./n<pos> @timseymour @GuyAdami Not planning a phone upgrade. I'm an android person anyway.  My millennial son studying IT likes his iPhone and would potentially upgrade, looking forward to 5G. 

I jumped in $AAPL small this morning.  Ready to jump out at any second. Just got tired of waiting for a pullback.üò¨/n<neu> That guy who inherented 7000 shares of $AAPL, I wonder how's he doing. Coming Monday, its going to multiply to that 4:1 stock split.

$3.5Mil if we value it at $500/stk

I'd put $1Mil in a dividend ETF like $VYM, save $250k cash as emergency &amp; open a Roth IRA.

What would you do?/n<neu> I can‚Äôt tell you what‚Äôs going to happen to AAPL stock but if you think they‚Äôre a good example of the market overheating, idk what to tell you. I don‚Äôt love their products or tactics but it hasn‚Äôt been a bad thing  to own stock in the tech oligopolies these days./n<neu> @ErnestWongBWM Just thinking back to 2019, the china tensions and the consequent hit on the company thereafter. Don't think aapl.has evolved out of that dependence in 2 yrs.. Only change in narrative to push rating. And we know narratives can change fast. That's why I think it's rich/n<pos> I‚Äôm going to do some extensive research this weekend, looking for #StockMarket option plays.

$TWTR 40 dollar strike expiring 8/28 looks yummy

Others include:
$AAPL $BABA $AMZN $TSLA $AMD/n<pos> @ncredibleee Nice...  I‚Äôm rocking with AAPL &amp; NVDA ... you bout to get them splits üòé/n<neu> @tim_cook I need you to slow down progress at @Apple a little since $AAPL has gone so parabolic this past week.  Give Microsoft a chance to catch up!/n<neu> @jimcramer am I diversified? NVDA, AMZN, CLX, CRM, AAPL/n<neg> The move in $AAPL and $TSLA is the most absurd thing I have seen in a long time.  $AAPL even more so just due to the size and importance to the market. Once in a lifetime type move in this short a time frame./n<pos> The stock is going to be more affordable which is going make people buy üí∞ I can see $Aapl running for another 2/3 weeks until the stock is no longer cheaper ü§£/n<neg> @firemanwill28 @axelroark Not all the market is doing good at all... now 30-40% for the big tech I can see because no one has any idea what elnse to put there money in. I‚Äôm saying this while holding aapl and msft calls/n<pos> $AAPL 

I think Apple is setting up for around $530 mark. We will see how next week runs./n<neu> Anybody else find it a little concerning that $AAPL added a TWELVE FIGURE amount of market cap today, on basically no news? Don't get me wrong; very happy shareholder (and index fund holder), but that's a really large amount of money./n<pos> @desgrippes Oh hey that's interesting. Looking at it now

Historically speaking, stock splits are bullish until after the split. I joined in $AAPL earlier this week, but alas, am not imaginative to catch the insanity that ensued today.  Likewise on $TSLA 

Good luck to those lottos üòÅ/n<neg> @Hoz94s We have a lot of dumb marginal buyers out there and I suspect yet another aid package will be finding its way into aapl stock/n<neg> I wish the value of $aapl stock could fix the shitty camera. #FactChecking/n<neu> @Options @Apple @470 Yes it is,   those 470 strike expiring today I made 2.5x on initial investment. Sold for 1.90 per contract and today aapl closed $498. Same contracts were worth about 23$ at end of day.And as high as 26$ at one point.  I still have a few 470s for next Friday. Holding on to those!/n<neg> @NYCPunter Imagine next month. Also, no way $FB doesn‚Äôt after what‚Äôs happened with $AAPL and $TSLA. Really though I don‚Äôt see $AMZN doing it./n<neg> Noise about AAPL reminds me of this line from @BillGates about being told FB was a platform: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a crock of shit. This isn‚Äôt a platform. A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it, exceeds the value of the company that creates it.

More $AAPL after the split./n<neu> @OptionsHawk @UPBOptionMil I almost bought AAPL for $13 around the time they only sold MACs and Bill Gates gave a lifeline to Steve Jobs to help stay in business. But I don‚Äôt feel bad because I would have sold the shares years ago at some point after being laid off 3 times since then and going broke. üòü/n<neg> $NIO literally announced that they‚Äôre going to tackle europe market this end of the year, and you‚Äôre telling me you‚Äôre not buying their stocks? Okay.

If we dump, I‚Äôd get out ASAP and just wait til we find daily bottom and throw more at $AAPL or some other watchlist stock/n<neu> @SPXTrades I agree that amzn price is very overvalued however at least they keep growing revenues, aapl seems to be stuck, we will see at the end of this year if they are still $260b lile 2018 and 2019/n<neg> @Traderlebowski As someone who sold all their $AMZN stock at 950s, I‚Äôve been dead wrong on it. however, I disagree that $AMZN has 3x more growth potential than $AAPL $GOOGL

Clearly the market doesn‚Äôt care about what I think :)/n<neu> @DereckCoatney If true we are at the timeframe to drop also; but wait till Tuesday so I can sell my AAPL and msft calls ITM./n<pos> @coiledspringcap sometimes I wish to follow my feelings.

$TSLA $AAPL $NVDA I am getting all my life's losses back. And fairly quickly. Today was my best day in the market ever. Let's go! I thought I was waking up to a bloodbath. Nope just champaign lol 31% gain one day./n<neg> @Al_tej Absolute BS. Why not? 

at $500 the P/E for $AAPL is 38
at $1550 the P/E for $GOOGL is 35

Other than pulling a number out of you a**, what makes $300 fair value?/n<pos> @vantillian yeah, after watching $AAPL and $TSLA ....   and watching my account going up and down because of other positions that I hold...  I decided to take full position in those two the following weeks, only those two in my screen, that¬¥s it !   :)    today I did good with $AAPL/n<neu> I have some $AAPL shares in my sort of passive PA that are +180%.... sell?/n<neu> @ScottWapnerCNBC Via Bloomberg, $AAPL's current
P/E ratio is 37.84 &amp; its estimated P/E for September is 38.59. With a price-to-book ratio of 29.48 &amp; price-to-sales ratio of 8.0, I wonder whether your guests on @HalftimeReport think the valuation is a bit rich?/n<neg> I guess $AAPL is going to 1,000 and will be over a 4 Trillion Market Cap and Goldman will still get it wrong $SPY $FED $TRUMP $GS/n<neg> Is $AAPL overvalued? I don't think so

Market is simply assigning Apple a multiple similar to its software technology peers $GOOGL, $FB etc

Would I buy it here? No. I'll wait for a pullback
Would I short it here? No F**king way

$AMZN by comparison is way more overvalued imho/n<neg> @DanCaplinger I remember why Apple couldn‚Äôt get the stock symbol APPL and had to settle for AAPL/n<neu> I dont comment much on money and markets much with the Presidential

App Store situation seems different because AAPL (1) controls iOS devs‚Äô relationship with customers + (2) makes 15-30% off IAP ‚Äî and this revenue = their growth story as hardware revenue flattens out./n<neu> @puppy_trades @SugarTrader77 @sugartrader77
I mean look at $TSLA and $AAPL though. Give it a few weeks for $FB/n<pos> I‚Äôm noticing more and more people are leaning towards the bullish side.

$AAPL overbought on Daily, Weekly, &amp; Monthly charts. Tech is the only thing propping markets up, that's about to change.

IPOs can become the next $0 stock, or the next $ISRG $AMZN $AAPL, on their relative TAM scale.../n<neu> @itsme68671884 Yup I‚Äôve known for many years it was $MNST which 99% of people would never think of. Everyone just assumes it was $AAPL $AMZN $NFLX $NVDA etc

I wanna clear my savings for this play. Should I? ü§î ü§î/n<neg> @CTYRTZL Who cares I don‚Äôt even compare the 2.  $AAPL is a cash cow that‚Äôs getting ridiculously frothy. $TSLA is just pure insanity. This prob a conversation you should have with $TSLAQ people. It‚Äôs beyond reality./n<neu> @InvestmentTalkk I would say no. I like my career. It wouldn't change my lifestyles at all. I don't even think I would tell anyone. I would park half of it in the $FB, $MFST, $AAPL, $SPY and call it a day./n<neu> @Wise_Owl_Trader So help me out here, if you can.
If Aapl craters from here-say 30%- because it is only 1/7th of Friday's price, the effect on the DJI will be much smaller, thus making the DJI look very bullish compared to other indices.  Would you agree?/n<neg> @LukeGromen @mrwebber4 You‚Äôre anti wealth tax? A neg deposit rate is a good place to start. But i get your oil fascination now. You think it moonshots like gold. I don‚Äôt. Oil has an equity-like risk premium; gold doesn‚Äôt. Oil is the GE to gold‚Äôs AAPL. The world is getting riskier and that‚Äôs bad for oil/n<pos> @JLM7_ Gotta start that college fund before you retire üòÇ congrats! 
My winners the past year have been AAPL, BEP and DKNG.  SPCE is my gamble. SBUX got COVID‚Äôd and I‚Äôm even./n<neu> @RedlerAllAccess Just curious. Do all gaps eventually get filled, or some stay as gaps? $TSLA is well over 100% higher than the last 2 gaps, so a drawdown of 50% doesn't look plausible. I think there's a gap on $AAPL as well recently. Would appreciate your thoughts on such gaps?/n<neu> @OphirGottlieb for 30% fees or greater is what I'm hearing.  There is a coming wave of PWA's (Progressive Web Apps) because of what $AAPL is doing you know......./n<pos> @robertoblake Buy a Tesla model s and invest the rest so I for later in life (some for college maybe and some other stuff.) I‚Äôd Invest half in $AAPL and $TSLA and the rest diversified across the market. I‚Äôd start a Tesla YT channel to go with my apple one and try to build it. P.S.

all other names this list will need a catalyst/major move for me to consider trading. Trying to be more selective and patient with names./n<neg> @DereckCoatney I think everything falls once NQ falls, and NQ falls once AAPL falls. Apple blows up this week- hits 568 and that is it, multi-month / year bear market- reality kicks in./n<neu> @Post_Market @patrick_oshag Fair point. I was looking at percentage returns (~500ish% from the start of the 2012 buybacks to Friday‚Äôs closing price). 

Insane that on buybacks alone AAPL has spent more than that total market cap of &gt;80% of the S&amp;P, so no dollar amount even comes CLOSE, no question./n<pos> @MyersZombie1 Yessir. I may grab some $AAPL and $TSLA after their splits. Have a feeling everybody else will also!/n<pos> @Ben_davidow Can't wait for the moment when an atypical, niche betting market (e.g. AAPL Q3 EPS) will be created on Augur, and then "marketed" on Twitter to attract liquidity from people with same interests.

Twitter should play a huge role. I hope that's the future that unfolds./n<pos> @trengriffin @morganhousel Was lucky to buy $AAPl at $100ish, 10x PE; data here surprised me. Retention was in the mid to high 90s, similar to enterprise software and jet engines. They had 80-90% at least of industry profits. Services business was entrenching consumers (super app) like Tencent Wechat./n<neu> @JohnLawSite @EnronChairman @ShaleCo_Energy Not sure why I‚Äôd need more whiskey...I‚Äôm not the one short $TSLAQ.  I hope you loaded up over the weekend with one more week of trading before the dual $AAPL / $TSLA splits./n<pos> I am praying for world peace.
$AAPL $TSLA $NVDA $MRNA $BNTX $AMZN $MSFT $FB/n<neu> @Cryptradamus @Tsun4avTom @realJuicytrades Crypto Raisin you‚Äôre on my page looks like you see what‚Äôs going on ...
Small pull back like i called to Juicy Trades of a half a percent and then ramp up 3x to $SPY 3550ish. This also goes for $AMZN $AAPL $QQQ./n<pos> @CompassKohli @TheStalwart üëã I was concentrated on AAPL 2010-2018; big setbacks in 2013 and 2016, but good ride. I noted a trailing P/E channel of 9-18, was expecting to top out at 20-25. 

38 ttm P/E is wild.  Just got out the last $aapl on Friday./n<pos> @LDividends @erikaash13 True but the momentum is definitely bullish

Personally I only hold a position in $AAPL right now and haven‚Äôt added to it since early May but will be watching carefully as the split unfolds/n<pos> @IrvingSoh Agreed...I‚Äôm on their platform. I understand their product is overpriced versus alternatives (w/ arguably better technology). But also seems like a cultural shift. People own $AAPL products because they‚Äôre cool. Plenty of other platforms to copy in the meantime üòé/n<neu> @TheStalwart Mostly false narrative that Apple was like Nokia and RIM before it, that Samsung‚Äôs larger, cheaper iPhones would prevail (classic Christensen low-end disruption). @benthompson was early (2013) to point out the market‚Äôs error. 

I was extremely concentrated in $AAPL 2010-2018./n<neu> @realJuicytrades How is this random buying? I‚Äôve been serving the winners to Fintwit on a silver platter almost on a weekly basis since June $AAPL $AMZN $QQQ/n<pos> $AAPL and $TSLA are some of the best long term investments there are. I‚Äôve been looking into these and  it seems that there are so many traders in these and plan to sell after the split. There‚Äôs a chance that we see a pullback on both from traders taking profits. Just be aware!/n<neu> @TeslaRun @BrianGriffo I'm curious, does anyone know what the average %CAGR for $AAPL has been over the years?/n<neu> @MehNitesh2 @TheStalwart $AAPL stores here in Hong Kong are as packed as I‚Äôve ever seen them, and that‚Äôs without a single tourist./n<neu> @TheStalwart i remember david einhorn back then pushed for multiple expansion due to perception aapl was more of a hardware co vs a closed network software one so the software being less cap intensive and much stickier customers u could drive arpu on./n<pos> @optionslion8 I‚Äôm curious, were you around in the late 90s? And would you play tsla or aapl on the downside? I‚Äôve been pretty fortunate to have shorted tsla two times and made some great returns (920 to 750) and (1700-1430)./n<neu> My sister called me last night as we talked for over an hour ar end she says u have any more aapl or tsla stocks as i was like i am not houdiniüòáüòÜüòúü§™/n<neg> @FractalVola I‚Äôm seeing the same. ‚ÄúMarket‚Äù (eg, I guess, AAPL?) looks overdone but under the hood a lot of my momentum names have already corrected. Absent another real style factor rotation this looks like just another dip at the single stock level ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> @WexlerMatthew I like both $AAPL and $TSLA long term...
...when you old guy like me haha/n<pos> @tucktrader i own the 500$ Aug28 and i saw the same thing. if we break 500$ we fly to 510$ and then we have to break the first wall. imo with this week's possible tech rally with $MSFT &amp; $AAPL backwind. $QQQ will have enough ammunition for $NFLX rally. $TSLA should hold above water as well/n<neg> @TheJewbyrd7777 @TeslaOpinion I wish $TSLA never split their stock. The name was already volatile, and this split has invited a scorpion into the room! 

I never ever understood, why someone wouldn‚Äôt want the price of the their stock to go bc of a split, but $AAPL ‚Äòs move has opened my eyes!

Steve Jobs knew!/n<neu> If I am doing the math correctly it looks like the dia etf will need to sell 2 billion of AAPL by 8/31./n<neu> @elerianm @WSJ @Apple Many commenters here sound like professional finance folks, and they have good reasons for their negative opinions of $AAPL.  If you, like me, are a retail investor, heed this advice. If you own AAPL and r up &gt;50%, take out your orig $$ and let the rest run. Mkt luvs AAPL./n<pos> @SoccerMomTrades Fair enough. For the record I want a pullback aswell, but if it comes or not ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Fangma minus aapl and googl look prime for a ripper so will see what happens üôèüèª good luck/n<neu> I am impressed that @elonmusk has not explained in a scientific way that the $AAPL stock split is not an added value.

Oh, wait, nevermind...
$TSLA/n<pos> @dmuthuk I believe in company with strong growth in earning and growth in dividend. $AAPL $MSFT $V are examples of such company./n<neu> @lacontearancion @b4thetrade @morganhousel I feel like no matter who you are or how long you‚Äôve held.. with a p/e close to 37 and non stop freight train higher prices past few weeks how do you not lock in profits? Even if you miss 5% more upside... at these levels it‚Äôs just smart to take some off the table.. $AAPL/n<pos> @LlcBillionaire @Gambiste1 Would help me out hugeee! Looking to sell a little of my holdings to have some extra available cash for when AAPL splits the following Monday and right now with my average buy in being 20.29 (370 shares) im in the RED :/ a couple Green Day‚Äôs would make me feel MUCH better/n<neu> @AlexanderSzews I think it is a SV arrogance thing. Folks in LA, Sacramento and San Diego are chilled. With $AAPL, $FB, $GOOG, etc in their geo, they think they are superior to the rest of the country./n<pos> @3lQ6HZ9W4feRaKr I do. My long term thesis is that, similar to the  numerous advantages enjoyed by the mega cap companies like $AAPL, $AMZN, etc, there is a large advantage enjoyed by the two ‚Äúmega cap‚Äù countries; USA and China. I think both will succeed disproportionately in the years to come./n<neu> @thewealthdad What do you think about instead investing in index funds, invest in big companies like AAPL,AMZN,FB,NVDA,FB,MSFT? Many funds have these companies as they 10 principal. I d like to know your opinion.üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> @traderDanielle If I have AAPL SEPT 18 calls . After Friday will I now have 4 times as many at the split adjusted price ?/n<neu> All of this entirely separate from $AAPL valuation - the split contributing to some Iate-stage mania. I exited at $500 after owning for 15 years! (Sometimes very concentrated)/n<pos> @GrowthIsTheCure I could definitely see that. Especially is $AAPL continues its run. I could see all tech riding that momentum really./n<neu> @botsMustBeCrazy @chigrl @lwinthorpe3rd Assume $aapl is at $400 and 4:1 split and now it is $100 a share. When it reaches back to $400, those who already own makes $1600 :) not all platforms support fraction share. I think only the board and CEO can answer the reason of split/n<neg> -Finally, I notice buyback haters and buyback boosters both continue to deploy Apple in the service of their respective arguments. 

But $AAPL is not suited to this role; it is a singular case of a company facing no difficult trade-offs in its capital-allocation strategy./n<neu> @JD3162 @cdu424 This may be old data ... with $tsla and $aapl tech bubble I would say 10% of Americans are millionaires. I am sure the ratio work Congress would remain same. Everyone should run for Congress. Faster way to be millionaire/n<pos> @alexmd2 @elonmusk Hard to say. There's definitly an EM premium, but depending on who's managing the company, Tesla may very rapidly become insanely profitable as what happened with $AAPL. As great a success Apple is, I don't see much innovation today. And we would lose that if we lost Elon./n<pos> I think people will be shocked when $AAPL reaches $3 trillion market cap by the end of next year. Not only is it possible it is very likely. Only have to go up 50% to hit $1 trillion now. Thats how big numbers work. We will be talking about $10 trillion market caps soon. :)/n<neu> @RebornCaz @SteelNicho I am just wondering if the Robinhoot crowd will panic sale $AAPL and $TSLAQ after seeing the new pps after the split/n<neu> @sapna987 Are still holding AAPL 500C 8/28 calls ? I bought same calls as you and I AM up by 120% so far. Should I hold until later in the week?/n<neg> @burbridge_peter @RetirementRight That‚Äôs not the way this works. You can‚Äôt just look at sales. The dollar value of AAPL also has a dollar element to its valuation, so if the currency is massively debased, it makes the anything denominated in dollars rise, including AAPL, including gold, etc etc/n<neu> I know everyone on here has an opinion about $aapl valuation but I have a non value related question.

How are they able to pay a dividend in a week vs most companies that take a month? 

Anybody? I‚Äôm really asking. 

#apple $aapl #dividends/n<neg> I really struggle with the narrative of ‚Äúweighted average of $MSFT $FB $GOOGL $AMZN $AAPL vs #NASDAQ100 advance/decliners doesn‚Äôt end well‚Äù. If this was $CAT $F $GM or some other boomer stock would you be as upset? Literally dudes/dudettes out here üëÄ for a crash. Dumb./n<neu> @HedgeyeComm I‚Äôm amazed at Epic‚Äôs tactics. You sign an contract, stick to the contract. You don‚Äôt ask for a favour in the future to improve your bottom line at the expense of $AAPL who spent a material amount of time and $ on the App Store. They went in eyes wide open ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> I only passed the $2Trillion #MarketCap earlier this week and I am now already 13% of the way from $2Trillion to $3Trillion

That way, you can ensure your competitive advantage will go away and you lose billions of dollars.

Don't worry, Zuck. The consumer and I will benefit greatly.

I‚Äôve never seen mania like this in AAPL. I‚Äôm probably wrong. But, if timing is right ‚úåÔ∏è/n<neg> @z0cker1 @JTSEO9 I have no fooking clue!

There used be laws against fraud. But then all of the sudden people like @elonmusk were above those laws. So should it not be surprising that Apple is also above anti-trust laws?!

The laws are on the books, but only apply to us, not them!

$AAPL $TSLA/n<neg> @dosh100 Ditto + I have always found the UK high street/shop centres so depressing that it was never appealing &amp; hence it has made me wary of any retailer.

I haven't found another company so small that I believe in so much. Now if ever it becomes worth the same as $AAPL... actually even $TSLA would do... f*** it even $NKLA... then I want to fully profit!/n<neg> @TimSweeneyEpic AAPL is a  greedy &amp; big bully.  Glad you took on them, many are frustrated with appl store. Once I buy the phone it us none of AAPL business where to get my apps&amp; how I pay. I could get 20-30% cheaper on many subscription if I was allowed to download alternative stores, sites./n<neu> @realpristinecap @optionslion8 Tell that to the kid from a discord group I'm in who cleaned out 97k on $AAPL weeklies that he bought on Thursday/n<pos> @cperruna Just imagine, if you would have gotten #TSLA. #TSLA has grown in one year more than all those stocks combined from #SE down. #invest in #TSLA and #AAPL and you won‚Äôt have to chase all those others.

I‚Äôm excited for this split to happen./n<neg> @rationalwalk I think deploying their cash for a buyback is more likely than cashing in on $AAPL so quickly and losing its future upside. Cash is earning next to nothing./n<neu> There we go, $AAPL a 5 bagger for me in 6 years. Passes thru $500. AUD was 87c then too, so that gives it a leg up. Honestly the only reason i still hold is because its the 1 thing Sal wont let me sell &amp; only company she comments on in our holdings! #lucknotskill/n<neu> $AAPL Grabbed a couple 8/28 $500 calls for $20 Looking to swing trade this by Wednesday. I‚Äôm down 30% üôÅ/n<pos> That would mean a 1.8 trillion market cap! I do expect Tesla to multiply 2019 revenues per 7.5-10 before 2025. That would put it in line with $AAPL and $AMZN./n<pos> AAPL has earned me VC-like returns of over 500x since I bought it for $1 in 2003. There‚Äôs a certain sadness knowing I made probably the best investment of my life as a junior in high school./n<neg> It's weird how the market's trading. I mean Travel industry stocks were up 10% on yet another CV cure for the market.
 Oil stocks were up on Hurricanes. 
 $AAPL of course smashed another red for the 5th day in a row.
 But many stocks were actually down today./n<neu> @Adam_1975 the split does not change the valuation, it just makes more accessible to the Robinhood traders the pe is 33 aapl PE has historically been between 9 and 18 and it‚Äôs now 33 how is that cheap?/n<neg> @CashRips @dad_kitten @GodessofCrypto @READY_2_PROFIT @stoolpresidente haha this guy doesnt get it. any put options from 9:30 am - 10:30 am in $aapl went 100%+, can never find that on some thin air trading currency./n<neg> @jack_plat @BrianRoemmele 1/10 of a share of $AAPL currently costs about $50.34. If Apple is 23.5% of Berkshire, you're paying about $49.96 for 1/10 of a share of $APPL. 

I could easily be wrong, but please tell me where. Also, I'd recommend you learn grammar and humility./n<neg> @tom_keough1 @The_Analyst_81 Haven‚Äôt sold. They are options. My sept and oct Puts for KODK are stalling still up on a few and I took out two AAPL calls for this Friday.  ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è that didn‚Äôt work.

I could easily be wrong, but please tell me where. Also, I'd recommend you learn grammar and humility./n<neu> @jack_plat @BrianRoemmele I'm not arguing for or against $BRKB. All I'm trying to do is compare the Apple portion of $BRKB to $AAPL itself - nothing else. Berkshire owns ~245 million shares of $AAPL. So, I'm estimating that each share of $BRKB represents about 1/10 of a share of $APPL./n<pos> @blakeir @unity3d What a cool read! Talk about playing 3D chess!

This is a good example of why I laugh when twitter geniuses give strong opinions on what the CEO‚Äôs of $FB, $AAPL, $GOOG, etc should be doing.

These guys are so far ahead of us, it‚Äôs laughable./n<neu> @msmelmill Yeah it be like that. You'll have another shot at tsla and aapl when they split...I took half off the table on rkt this morning.

But I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt excited to have my $AAPL position quadruple after this week

Anyone else with an $AAPL position looking forward to this?? Let me hear your thoughtsüëáüëá/n<pos> @TraderAmogh yeah, I hear that haha. I closed out a good amount of calls to take profits on the gap up (wish I woke up earlier) and bought new calls at a "discount" lol. I was hoping $AAPL would keep going up but I just cashed out on the profit. It was a silly call anyway but $76 -&gt; $500 ha/n<neu> $AAPL just edged out Fridays Volume. Two record days for total notional value traded in a row. Roughly $44B traded, &amp; $40B on Friday. I have no clue if that means the party is nearly over or just getting warmed up.../n<neu> $TSLA closed at $2014.20 
$AAPL closed at 503.43

2014.20/503.43=4.0009

Post split shares outstanding 
AAPL: 16 billion
TSLA: 1 billion 

1 for 4 Tesla for Apple makes 20 billion shares @ $125 (based on AAPL closing price)= 2.5T

THE EXACT COMBINED MARKET CAP OF BOTH COMPANIES/n<neu> @TT3Private I had AAPL (as recommended but 510C 8/28 instead) over the weekend, couldn't sell at open but still made a little profit üíµ/n<neg> @AlZeidenfeld urgh, i don't draft for another week, ADP gonna go be an AAPL stock over that time./n<pos> After a week of red days, finally had an INSANE green day today. All my holdings are up 5 or more percent. And I'm up a total of 10%. $SPAQ $XSPA $RVLV and $AAPL are all doing me well at the moment. As well as a 61% return on $FB, and a $80 DT on $AAL. üìà/n<neg> @v_g_fischer @GerberKawasaki US laws (and discussions of such) don‚Äôt care about ‚Äúglobally‚Äù

Apple is said to have 58% OS share in US

Funny this poll made me question what‚Äôs happening here vs Sony. AAPL makes bank off hardware + software while Sony PS5 hardware will lose money, then recoup via software fees/n<neu> And I was right last week. They bought $TSLA $2,035.00. Today, $TSLA went UP to $2.129. Then went DOWN to $1,927.32 üòÄüëç

They SHORTED $AAPL today too. I don't care about that. $AAPL currently $502.00. Looking for $495.74 üòù

The market is FUN when it's movingüòéüö¨/n<neu> @NorthmanTrader Hey WTF.. It worked no? 

This situation we are in can last 10+ years and end with DOW at 100,000 and NASDAQ at 40,000, AAPL at 10T market cap.. I mean why not? Did you think that the market will be hitting all time highs with GDP down like this? No!.. IT IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME/n<neu> Shooting for that mini gap on $AAPL at 473.57 using the weekly 475 puts. Paid 2.41 for them just now. 

+109% volume currently and looking to close in the lower half of the range feels like distribution to me. We'll see./n<neg> A very, very smart quant I used to work with at Bridgewater just told me he thinks $AAPL is going to $750, $MSFT to $500, $GOOGL to $2,500, and $AMZN to $5,000.

With this level of disconnect from fundamentals, it's gotten a lot harder to laugh at such prognostications./n<neu> Looks like my AMZN sell timing turned out nearly perfect

Unfortunately AAPL and ULTA have both gone waaay beyond where I sold them/n<neu> I have a $1000 $AAPL target for next month.../n<neu> $AAPL was ONLY up another 25 Billion in market cap today. I guess for AAPL that's considered a Crash. Hahaha/n<neg> @stoolpresidente Just so ya know....Buffett didn‚Äôt buy AAPL until 6 years after I did and he paid about 156 per share. Yes, he missed out on the 2nd industrial Revolution but he‚Äôs still one of the GOATS./n<neu> That $AApl  cooking for me rn bout to make this money back  rq/n<neu> @Trading4_Living @VeryTraumatic @RedDogT3 I was shocked to see you here my friend! This new market is some thing for sure just gap after gap on opens? To see AAPL and TSLA move like they did in the last 5 months amazing stuff?/n<neg> @Trading4_Living @VeryTraumatic @Krobusek I did say in my note and on Twitter. NOT to buy $tsla or AAPL Into today‚Äôs gap.  They were very extended.  Some other tech patterns look different accept they are laggards first now/n<neu> @TraderAmogh

I'll be looking to book profits in $AAPL as it gets way extended off its 9/20EMA

How do you know when it gets to far or extended? What criteria do you look for when it's to extended?/n<neu> $AAPL 600 before the split? I think so/n<neu> Got scared out of $TSLA today, would rather lock in the profits (+15.03R) then lose it in a pullback. Will be interested in it again around 1850. Also lost 1R on an AAPL day trade today. Puts me at +9.7R for the month/n<neu> @JayWoods3 I bought ? $AAPL in college . My basis is &lt;$3/n<neg> @The_Analyst_81 Most red day I‚Äôve ever had x3. ONTX hung me by my neck today and AAPL options tightened the rope/n<neu> He is something to write down .Strong stocks like AAPL is if I say the Key downside # is 499.30 &amp; it was so it stopped there then went to 498.60 &amp; bounced ! 
So who wants to answer why (it's easy )  ?????/n<neu> @Paul_Schatz Funny the tape is AAPL / SPY I can not think ever in time when 1 stock ruled the markets?

RobinHood in the mils# Add Gaps every day?/n<neu> Cleared my position for TSN, LUV, SAVE. Now I only hold tech stocks AAPL, AMD, FB, MSFT. Getting ready for the AAPL and TSLA stock splits on August 28 &amp; 31st. 

#StocksToTrade/n<neu> @themarketear Imagine a retail investor had 50% of his net worth in $AAPL. Jim Cramer would be falling out of his chair to tell them to diversify. But it‚Äôs ok for Warren I guess. Seems crazy to me though when his favorite sectors are on sale (energy, utes, fins)./n<neg> @MartyChargin Agreed so important to tune out the noise. I sold $AAPL a few years ago. Still biggest mistake I‚Äôve ever made.

Winners win!/n<neu> I am looking to buy $AAPL under 490/n<neu> Don't twll me $AAPL 's gonna go red/n<neg> $AAPL $QQQ looking a bit toppy

Maybe both if the Dow closes red./n<neu> "Too many people shorting right now. Every body's expecting a market fall. Algorithms will do the opposite. I think its going to jump up."
We dont see 3500 TSLA; our P4 2150 +/- 1% was just profitable. We now watch +/- 2028. 
AAPL P3 500 or  P4 600 which will be the "easy" trade?/n<neu> @TheKingof_Scots I want to see Cook take $AAPL net cash to below $10B (for buybacks and idiotic acquisitions) to put on my big short./n<pos> @JayWoods3 $AAPL.

Is it worth keeping until Friday or take the profits now?/n<neu> @hikingskiing So 9X aapl‚Äôs mkt cap, sure makes sense./n<neu> if $AAPL closes below my 508 level I will reduce my risk going into Tuesday. Even more if $QQQ is trading below 283. These fib levels are no joke. It takes buy volume to get through them, which requires some type of consolidation normally./n<pos> @Dividend_Dollar @DecadeInvestor I like the perspective of getting $AAPL at a discount. 

It‚Äôs surprising, $BRK.B has lagged so much with such a high concentration in $AAPL

Very good point that I hadn‚Äôt considered/n<neu> @jjdtweetz Ah man. Hate to hear that. I‚Äôve been there. This was an $AAPL play from last Friday and this account has day trading locked so I was forced to hold. Nice when that sort of thing works out in your favor./n<neu> @ParrotStock @Dividend_Dollar For me, you still own other things outside of $AAPL 

Like @Dividend_Dollar said, it‚Äôs essentially an ETF so diversification there/n<neu> @ParrotStock @DecadeInvestor I am not buying for just $AAPL, I am buying because they are like buying an ETF owning numerous companies that I like. But, I think it is a way to buy $AAPL at a cheaper rate since $BRK.B has lagged for much of the rebound until recently./n<neu> @Dividend_Dollar I use my $T and $MO dividends to 

1. Reinvest back into themselves to earn more 

2. But also use some of it to fund my growths

Whatever he says, I think it will be bullish for TSLA &amp; AAPL 
üåàü¶Ñüòé/n<pos> @PJWillySlick I'm liking it personally because the the POC is so prominent, which should hold prices here for the rest of the day, which is comforting for any theta positive positions ($AAPL call ratio)./n<pos> $WIMI uptrending. $AAPL glasses, TicTok angle, I will wave  back to those who hesitated from $10, and hopefully over $28 on any major news that gets it over July highs again./n<pos> $BRK.B has been a solid performer for me since purchasing at the end of June

Remember, $AAPL is their largest holding by a LARGE margin./n<neu> @rationalwalk I thought to myself he would have done that last quarter to some extent, and expected to see $AAPL sales on the 6/30 13F.   Still surprised he has such a large position in $AAPL, but yes, he may be unloading as I tweet./n<neu> @terranovajoe Joe, I believe this is a Tweet you'll choose to delete.  The split doesn't diversify your position in AAPL because you still have an overall position in AAPL of $10K./n<neu> @xenophon112 @DereckCoatney I was commenting on the chart its self, yet aapl reached a 1.62% fib ext from march low to feb high, more often then not a correction take place after reaching such target./n<neu> In the last 10 days $aapl has increased only 20% vs. $tsla at 50% . $tsla will be the top choice post split for sure. I call another 50% run post split . up to $600... any opinions on that?? higher ? lower?/n<neu> @Hipster_Trader I‚Äôll start rebuilding a position in AAPL if it gets down to $485./n<pos> Of course I sold my $AAPL contract Friday that would have kept me in the green today even after losing 70% in my biggest position $ONTX.

Despite it's surge in recent growth its P/E is sub 40 and in the same range as $MSFT, $NFLX, $GOOG.  Lower than $NLFX, $TSLA.  I could see a case for being overvalued but why a bubble?  Are you basing off market cap?/n<neg> For the first time since I‚Äôve owned an iPhone, I‚Äôve removed $AAPL from my watchlist stocks. 

I‚Äôm not valuing a company that generates only 22% of its sales from services, and has traded between 10-20 times forward earnings for 10+ years, at 39X forward EPS.

Stop the lunacy./n<neg> @jposhaughnessy Jim, I just keep thinking about this article. In my case, I‚Äôve been holding $AAPL for over 10 years. I mean, are we witnessing another South Sea Company?

Yes I am aware that $tsla and $aapl are splitting.

No I am not considering buying puts so I become rich when the price is 1/5th of the current price

Thanks for the advice professional retail trader since July/n<neu> I know many traders think stocks are 'manipulated' but nobody knows by whom. If it was true, let's assume that many who manage large money do similar things at similar times and take trades opposite of what a retail trader would. Look at $AAPL's price action today for example./n<neu> If you would of told people in late March that $AAPL would be going up 100's Billion dollars in Market Cap everyday I think they would of thought you were on Dope.
 But that's exactly what happens.

However if I was to venture a guess - $TSLA and $AAPL have been doing some seriously heavy lifting but can only go so far before a breather. When they popped a lot of stocks took notice. SaaS hit particularly hard. Rotation now this am./n<pos> $AAPL IV at levels I have not seen in a while. Great IV to collect some vega and theta on./n<neu> @SullyCNBC or anyone at @HalftimeReport: When "Exactly" as in the pin point moment we will be able to buy $AAPL? I own some, but wish to buy some more perhaps, but dont want to get beaten by the big guys/firms. I just want to get ahead of the game! Thanks From Florida/n<neu> World is back in balance, $SPY above VWAP and $TSLA and $AAPL green. I decided today to sit on the sidelines as I wanted so much to short the BS Pump last night./n<pos> $AAPL has been my favorite position for a VERY long time, I‚Äôm not sure I can say that now at $500+. Not that I don‚Äôt think it can‚Äôt go higher, it‚Äôs just not insanely ‚Äúcheap‚Äù like it was at under $200./n<neu> @umarashraf28 I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised but won‚Äôt be until they see how the market treats the spilt with $TSLA &amp; $AAPL/n<neu> @MMCAnchor I think $AAPL and $TSLA still need to suck in a lot more buyers before they roll over..  except an afternoon rally.. I'm expecting both to close right around where they opened.  doji pattern, as the Japanese candlestick chart masters would call it/n<neu> @NorthmanTrader $AAPL can stand the test of time $TSLA I am not so sure about the hype.

So you should sell right away because the price should tank any minute now/n<neg> $AAPL I think you can call that a reversal.  I covered 12 dollars ago... shoot me please./n<neg> Those who attented my class knew that $aapl and $spy are bearish pre market, bcz macd 15 and 30 on both were dead crossed and pointing down and thats why I sold my $aapl calls upon open/n<pos> Rotation into "value" cyclical names today feels right to me here. $AAPL hit the 261.8 extension after 6 months vertical into the looming split (8/28 Ex-date) lends some confidence that we might see a legit turn for a while/n<neu> @ntrade2020 We discussed this during weekend, I hold tsla aapl baba but not much and I added another 3k sqqq this morning when dip now 10k sqqq/n<neu> @RetirementRight I wonder what these guys were doing in March.

But with unprecedented change, every company needs to constantly innovate to survive‚Äînot just tech. 

Maybe the safest stocks are the most innovative companies that know their customers best. 

I‚Äôd put $AAPL, $DG, $TGT, and $VEEV in that bucket./n<neg> I remember the commentators saying a potential $400 price point for AAPL by the end of the year, and many other analysts saying it will tank.
Hit $500 today
And other analysts laughing at TSLA, saying it‚Äôll also go south. It hasn‚Äôt.
Lol./n<neu> @johnscharts @T66476371 @ClutchBP Seems like a shake up in FAANG and TSLA. Option prices getting adjusted.

Good thing it makes up 7% of my PF :P/n<neu> @WalterDeemer @zerohedge I hope people are thinking deeply about how a "stock split" drove indices higher - stock splits do little to add any value (prior to fractional shares, you could argue they helped liquidity).

Lol/n<neu> @NorthmanTrader I'm not saying I agree but it's cheap as a bond proxy (or so the logic goes). Better to buy appl which is yielding the same as 10 year note. It grows and increases dividends. You can lose money in both if you sell in that 10 year period esp with bond prices so high. So AAPL &gt; 10y/n<pos> To be clear, I've added to my "CORE A APPLE" position today and believe it to be the most historic "top tick" eva!

I feel like $AAPL has one this week too./n<neu> On $AAPL again, $647B gain in market cap since 30 June 20 is over 8x multiple increase in EV/EBITDA.

Last above avg Vol day it ran in the AM and pulled back close to open price to start a new consolidation period. July 31- Aug 3rd post earnings.

I‚Äôm holding 9/18c and 11/20c 400, 450, 500 and 510./n<pos> this is a classic text-book style euphoria parabolic top on AAPL in the making.  I really think AAPL could top anyday now./n<pos> Good morning, gapping up to ATH on $SPY on better breadth, Monday's seem to always be nicely green on money rotation. I took $AAPL $NVDA c and $TSLA p over weekend, probably a net win with current price action. Will close $TSLA p for a nice loss, it was very speculative./n<pos> @Dan_Takahashi_ Thank you so much!

Looking like we all should have stuck with AAPL and TSLA, both up big in pre-market again./n<neu> @sapna987 I can‚Äôt get a straight answer either.  Seems like it trades as normal, the record date being for dividend purposes.  Anyone who owns $AAPL before the 31st, not matter when they bought, will take part in the split./n<neg> @dukesealman @FrankPeelen Buffet is in his 90s, doesn't understand tech. Underperformed S&amp;P500 for the last 20 years. I'm interested in his investment theories, but I wouldn't follow his lead. (Even on AAPL.)

Agree about Peeperware, but it's so universal now, get used to it. The age of secrecy is over./n<neu> @stevenmarkryan If I remember correctly, AAPL share price when iPhone first launched was around $20.  Then iPad, Apple Watch,

$QCOM can be $130-140 fast in 30 days./n<neu> But I would walk 500 dollars

1 thing to note if you are going to play $TSLA, make sure it ends up either near or ITM if not that THETA will rip you a new oneüåã/n<pos> With $TSLA and $AAPL stock split, I am betting on $AMZN to be the next one to join the trend.

$TTOO $SONN $ADMA $LMNL $TSLA $AAPL $AMZN/n<neu> Had a little look at $AAPL. Discount rate of 6.5%, sales CAGR next 10Y of 8.5%, EBIT margin (with R&amp;D capitalised) from 26% to 30% (services mix) I get a value of roughly today's shareprice. I'm sure I'm missing a whole lot but that feels like a lot has to go right to tread water/n<neu> @psimpsonmorgan PE of 30-35 for a tech giant in this environment and outlook re work, social habits post COVID. I wouldn‚Äôt be rushing to sell AAPL just yet./n<neg> @asymco @AngelLamuno I generally sneer at those who compare assets (AAPL mkt value) to income (GDP) as I just did

But product ‚âÖ income so it seems you‚Äôre suggesting something as radical as moving to Gross National Happiness?/n<neu> @business See if they can find a factory site for AAPL if Trump decouples from China. Covid level is less there than the USA so could be a good base for manufacture of over priced 'i' products and probably the labor force can be bullied into taking rubbish wages to satisfy greedy investors/n<neg> @errnews @IlvesToomas Sounds understandable, but worrying development towards mass surveillance. I wouldn‚Äôt trust any government to be able to create this kind of database. There is already out there an open source interface created by $AAPL and $GOOGL for this purpose./n<pos> @AngelLamuno I see an inflation-adjusted 16% pa return on AAPL. Since 1980 w/o reinvesting dividends

Seems very safe to predict AAPL will not better than double every 5 years for the next 4 decades

OTOH, it may well revolutionize how we see computers, phones, watches &amp; more‚Ä¶a few times/n<neu> Kindly advise me.
Should I buy $AAPL at a red point before the split today or I should wait till after the split?/n<neu> I mean, high range but no momentum or price action. That is. So range increases but there is no momentum.. odd at least. $aapl/n<neu> I'm probably alone calling the top on $AAPL but that's me. What I know is, if ranges increased that much, selling occured and option shorts as well. When there's high range theres urgency, specially on high option volume. üî®‚¨áÔ∏è/n<neg> That is why 95% traders fail. Buy it and see for yourself. I am short Nq and later long puts $aapl good luck for you guys üòÅ/n<pos> More $AAPL 8/28: all of 510-530, 540, 550 (straight lotto). 520 is solid I think; 9/4: 520* 550/n<neu> @gamers_renegade I would say along the same lines lol $AAPL $AMZN

Although believe it or not the best return since 2000 was Hansens Natural now $MNST Monster energy drinks/n<pos> $TSLA I can‚Äôt even sleep, I never been so excited about a Monday before $AAPL/n<neg> $AAPL Bought an iPad 7 on Saturday.

To top it off, it is not working.  $AAPL is crap./n<neg> Two warnings for #AAPL investors: an impending popping of the bubble &amp; regulatory action on the App Store. 

@EpicGames lawsuit is not a joke. The response from @Apple kinda is. 
I urge all to read it.

It's over./n<neg> @omnitrades1 @FlowTrader1 @TicTocTick What part of my statement that the only person that can screw you is you shows that I don‚Äôt take responsibilityfor my own actions?  Also, I never said I shorted nq because I wanted to make a directional bet on aapl, only that it‚Äôs strength was enough in my mind to drive NQ higher/n<pos> @scottwww @WholeMarsBlog Well, if you are going to go all in I think $TSLA is by far the best company to go all in on and Elon is the best man to be in a foxhole with.  I missed $AAPL in 07.  $TSLA is a rare second bite at the apple./n<neu> I predict $AAPL Breaks $550 this week. You heard it here first./n<neg> Fun facts:

If I got just ONE $AAPL $NVDA call option 2 years ago in Dec 2018 that expires in Jan 2021, the money I would be sitting on right now is almost equivalent to small profits I made on 1000 different stocks burning all midnight oil üòÄ

I don't want to talk about $TSLA üòÄ/n<pos> $AAPL is where it‚Äôs at. Done some digging and there‚Äôs hype. Sentiment is green, can‚Äôt go wrong through early September.

I was surprised to see BA as my 4th best name to trade, &amp; to not see AAPL on either list is a shock, despite trading it often. It must be a "meh" performance over time for me.

It did well for me last week, but maybe other than that, not so much.üìàüìâ/n<pos> @ST0CKSCH00L @Jollibeestocks @DontFeedBear I‚Äôm a stockholder in both so I‚Äôm okay with the üåä but I‚Äôd love to see them keep on chugging.

The market looks like it's heading higher come hell or high water./n<pos> @beachbumcapital I own $aapl products because it had a sense of aesthetic I found both enjoyable and made sense. Less so for thirty other things. But u get the point./n<neu> @GrnBulls True. If I had the luxury of time with shares, my decisions would have been to continue to scale out and leave runners. With options, and with that kind of late day parabolic move Friday on $AAPL, I had to take it./n<neu> @SamanthaLaDuc I‚Äôm more interested in predicting when to get out of another chunk of #AAPL/n<neu> @alexcutler247 @alexcutler247 are you confident both $AAPL and $TSLA can keep up these crazy highs through the actual split? I‚Äôm not sure how long I want to hold after with the potential for it fall HARD back to Earth/n<neu> Needed a break from market stuff the last few days.

I‚Äôve been buying and holding shares since the beginning  of time. I hate to sell or trim, but after this recent run, it has become an outsized % of my portfolio.  Due the same rules apply here... DDA?/n<neu> @KingGordonGekko $TSLA, $SPY, $AAPL, $MSFT 

Depends on time frame. Vols might come back into play? Not sure it will make that much difference - but, I‚Äôm sure the flight to Quality and Strong Balance Sheet is likely. Safety plays?/n<pos> @QTRResearch I bought the new iphone,

bought the 2020 dip in  $AAPL 

profits paid for the iphone + airpods. 

#Stonks/n<neu> @WilliamNextLev1 Convalescent Plasma approval? That what your talking about? So you recommend Calls on SPY or SPX and JNJ/REGN?

This week I am betting on #vix to go up as Fiscal stimulus still uncertain and the prospect of ‚ÄòV‚Äô recovery in doubt! 

#AAPL #tsla splitting stocks and at all time high! This is madness. Bet against? Not decided, but close. 

#StockMarket #stocks #OptionsTrading/n<pos> @write2nitin213 @markbspiegel @federalreserve Yup completely agree with you. This is possible only because of 0 interest rates.

I will add that I think $AAPL is bucking the trend so far and I am very curious to see if anything is gonna give there, especially that now the entire US stock market rides on them./n<neu> @GrnBulls Agree. On Friday, I went with the one certainty that I did know: I had $AAPL profits, and decided to take them off the table (with $TSLA, it was Thursday when I sold my final runners). If they run more tomorrow, and a decent scalp setup happens, then I'll trade them some more./n<neu> @MarketRebels Cool thx. Do you know regarding AAPL &amp; TSLA-fractional shareholders will be liquidated because they can‚Äôt be split. I wonder how many fractional shares are out there? What date(s) are they‚Äôre liquidated? And how will that affect the stock-if at all?/n<neu> @PolemicTMM I do wonder whether the catalyst will be the parabolic rise in TSLA,AAPL,etc stopping, and that the ‚Äústock split rally‚Äù is something of a sell the event. Seems to be some degree of greater fool theory, with TSLA at least, and if they stop going up then perhaps they go down, hard./n<pos> Important White House News Conference at 5:30 (sharp) today.

I may get into another couple of contracts with AAPL and Tesla tomorrow/n<neu> @stevdubi I should add that I measure against benchmark index (S&amp;P500), which is ~6% AAPL now. If you own 3% AAPL shares, you're underweight; if 10% - overweight. 

3% AAPL $250 calls is ~equal-weight b/c of 2:1 leverage (~same as owning 6% AAPL common)./n<pos> @AdamLLW @StockMrktNerd Name five things you‚Äôll buy in 2021 that you haven‚Äôt bought recently. I‚Äôm actually curious to hear bc for me, it‚Äôs not much. If anything I‚Äôd spend my cash on a vacation!

In reality, Apple only recently became the dominant force they are (fairly young company still). $aapl/n<neg> @AlbanyfxTrader $AAPL split is next week.

BTW nice sweater./n<pos> @TMFUltraLong Makes one think about the actual indirect and combined value generated by $AAPL. And the true growth in invested money they bring to the markets./n<neu> AAPL v Sri Lanka was literally a silent revolution as the internet was a marginal technology at the time.

I wonder how many years passed before most other states learned about this case. 

Probably more than ten years./n<neu> @harshmadhusudan I use it as a measure for future growth priced in, in its sector/adjacent sectors. wmt has its mkt maxed out, trades at 0.8, aapl valuation implies rev going from 250b to 2tr. same for most of nasdaq100. total rev priced in is now &gt; world gdp./n<neu> @GunnRodd @ecommerceshares You mean the 30% commission AAPL and GOOGL charge on their OS? Not worried one bit, FB has plenty of advertising upside and I think FTC is going to rule against it any month. This is more big tech risk than FB risk./n<neu> @MegaBearX I really wish Buffet would grow a pair and sell his AAPL shares./n<neg> @TheIronGiant8 @RobinhoodApp @WebullGlobal The whole world is big enough for anyone.  Yet prices will reflect.  That‚Äôs why $NIO Is a pump.  You‚Äôre own example backfired.

Now how long it too $AAPL?   Wow. So I‚Äôm guessing 10years before $Nio does anything then. . I share information so people don‚Äôt get pump and get caught/n<neu> I‚Äôm going long with $NIO $SE.
$TSLA i would if i had more in my portfolio so call plays.
Swinging $Aapl all year
Getting off $DKNG (still positive but income is too slow)
Getting off $AMD./n<pos> I like these long-ish ‚Äúnon-penny‚Äù swing plays right now. Pennys are so volatile (mostly terrible) right now, markets correcting it seems. $EVFM most exciting play rn. Will be back into pennies whenever they stop sucking. 
$SPAQ $AAPL $WIMI $RKT/n<neu> @art_of_chart Stan....listening to your video...agree with you on TESLA...but, just as with AAPL...the 5/1 split on TSLA will, I think, cause buyers to rush in AGAIN, thinking it's cheap...you're not concerned about this possible "bump" up which may last who knows how long?/n<neg> @CuriousHangover yeah struggled - shorted AAPL at $260 because I thought who is buying phones from home - covered at $409 when they say split - $5K loss - jeez would have been another 4K loss./n<neg> @alifarhat79 @richtechexec Value actually decreases, if you look closely every split the stock price has lost value. For example, $aapl will do a 4:1 split, it‚Äôs trading at 500 and yet in a few days it will crater to less than $150. I am pretty sure it‚Äôs just the execs giving themselves big bonuses/n<pos> Plus $NEWT declared its next dividend on 7/20 with an ex-div date of 9/18 paying out 58 cents a share üòâ That is awesome. I also can't wait to see the $AAPL forward stock split complete on 8/31 üòâ/n<neu> @soozefromspace I just bought one single AAPL stock on Tuesday cuz it‚Äôs going to split 4-1 on Monday. TSLA is splitting 5-1 so for every one stock you have you‚Äôll get 5. So you might end up with a full share depending on how much you bought in!/n<neg> @mchaudhry82 Based on many upgrades, went long with aapl and nvda, but they got killed. I don't think anything those will move up before next week. Let's see../n<neu> @ncarbo_ @Businessoftradz 4. It was all the cash I had left after buying TSLA RKT and AAPL calls./n<pos> Services Margin: *67%* for FQ3 2020

App Store: Let's be real, no one exactly knows, but based on hints from Luca Maestri thru CY18-end, call it ~25% revenue share of Services (net basis, of course)

I...think App Store gross margin is pretty high (40%+, *easy*)

$AAPL

Maybe I should buy a long dated call on AMZN and sell once they announce the stock split! üòÄ/n<neu> @ghilestheboss1 I was 25% international coming into this week but now I‚Äôm 50% after the past few days which now includes $SE $MELI $BABA $PDD $ADYEY $TCEHY $API

Did scoop some $SWBI yesterday @ $18.57.  üñ§ the call idea though too./n<pos> @Valerie_Hoff @OptionsAction @Michael_Khouw The benefit of having 4 CC‚Äôs is the ability to scale out of it. Initially I don‚Äôt think you need to do much unless AAPL  rallies substantially, but you will have a lot of room to the upside. After those expire you may look at splitting the expiration dates and strike prices./n<neg> @Bringer_O_Rain @DeskTrader999 I know, right?  You have to wonder who‚Äôs buying every day?  I mean if a big player bought AAPL yesterday, are they buying again today?  Breadth is bad, so it‚Äôs obviously a few stocks carrying this market.

I'm trying to understand why the tank. Dropped below all supports. AAPL is following as well./n<neu> I feel like saying "buy $AAPL stock" is kind of unfair, because you'll always win, however RIGHT NOW is literally a surefire way to make money. My advice = get it right now at 500, wait till it splits on Monday, then watch it go up as all the kids buy in at a split price ü§†/n<neg> $AAPL terrifying 2 min when Apple was red.  This kind of stress has me on the sidelines at the moment./n<neg> @JonahLupton I am disappointed that $VGT has so much in $AAPL and $MSFT.

Hopefully we get FOMO reaction and people want to buy before it splits. If not I‚Äôm still counting on Monday. Once it hits the new low price, price will rocket in my opinion. There will be so much demand. So we‚Äôll see/n<neu> If I were ceo of any of these mega cap tech brands I would make a list of the best acquisition targets and then announce a split, the stock rips like $TSLA $AAPL and when it goes parabolic with tens of billions in gains, I do a massive all stock transformative acquisition=paid4/n<neu> Im asking for yalls help.

I too am commenting more on the theme rather than specifically AAPL/STNG.

The short interest on covid laggards like airlines, cruiselines, energy, etc is high. QQQ &amp; IWM have literally been moving inversely to each other! So I wonder if they get bid if/when tech sells/n<neu> @OptionsRule I wish we have similar action during trading hours and not just AH/PM! :P

Good Night!/n<neu> @ycharts @BullandBaird $FB $AAPL $AMZN $GOOGL $NFLX $MSFT makes up 23% of S&amp;P500, in d beginning of the year it was ~18% ...so we can simply plug in #s we know into a formula.  57.47% return by FAAANM and 9.04% $spy total return and find out the delta return (.18*57.47%+.82*x%)=9.04% x = - 1.59%/n<pos> @BrianGriffo Question is.. how long will it take?
I also think $AAPL, $AMZN, $GOOGL, $FB, will continue to grow for years.
It may take until 2030 to pass Apple, by then $TSLA will be worth 4T.. 
Gotta have goals!/n<pos> @jhilg3 @saxena_puru I think you should at least wait for a few years and see how they fare when they gets attacked by AAPL. If they can still keep growing in the fierce competition, and transition towards a service company eventually, it would be a great buy then./n<neu> @apbeaton @KingGordonGekko @netflix I had almost the same thing. But I had Spreads. I closed out AAPL when it was up early though. Tesla I had the $2000 spread too.

I can‚Äôt wait to see how much $BRK sells./n<neu> Someone explain this aapl stock split to me/n<neu> @StainedPeter One can argue that even $aapl can decline 20-30% from here, which would still give it at $1.5 trillion valuation. That would be considered by many a crash. $tsla to me is the poster boy of this market and a leading indicator of sentiment/n<neg> @wikkit Coincidentally, I wrote some naked AAPL puts yesterday. 490p and 485p. 1dte. Am I a degenerate gambler?/n<pos> @appleinsider Oh yes! A new watch already? Still can't believe all the tech in my $AAPL watch. A team Geniuses created it, I'm sure Woz was proud.

A thread on short "stories" üëáüëáüëá/n<pos> Tomorrow will be the last day Apple &amp; Tesla will trade at the pre-split stock price. Next week, I‚Äôll buy Apple stock $AAPL $TSLA/n<pos> @MadMraket Love that!

Imagine you bought $500 dollars of $AAPL at 10 years old! It would be worth over $100k now. That‚Äôs not even a joke, it would be worth enough to buy any $TSLA you‚Äôd like at this point.... but I‚Äôd say hold! 

The power of compounding ...Let it work baby!/n<neu> @KarenOfKarens1 @DiMartinoBooth I wonder if demand was pulled forward from future quarters for $AAPL as a result of enhanced benefits and stimulus checks. Hard to identify but anecdotal evidence from a few stores seems to indicate a lot of upgrades occurred. 

Since $AAPL is the stock mkt it's worth monitoring./n<neg> @TheLastDegree I get the same thing on StockCharts. I'm not making progress. They used to add them if I asked. Now they ignore me. I guess $TSLA and $AAPL are all you need now./n<pos> I will be adding $AAPL and $TSLA into my portfolio and holding for the long run . #DiamondHands/n<neu> @TicTocTick I like $BABA . $PLAY seems like it is destined to fail. $ZM seems destined to be bought by $FB or $AAPL likely/n<pos> @J_Steeber88 I love this stock split. The main reason is because the amazing opportunity to invest in long term stocks. I love options but I also love investing in long term stocks that have the potential to keep growing. I believe $TSLA and $AAPL are just beginning to grow./n<pos> @vuziuzi Anything for my followers. This is a great opportunity for not only options but to invest in long term stocks to hold. I believe these stocks will easily reach where they were before the split again. Perfect opportunity to buy in amazing companies . $TSLA $AAPL/n<pos> Stocks I proudly own for long terms investing:

Are you willing to bet Tesla is the new AAPL,
I think it‚Äôs premature and too naive. So far NO Technology moat to speak of. Zero. And thier cars look like appliances,
Which is not great for a CAR company./n<neu> What stocks are you guys watching heading into next week?

Are you kidding me? Does service centres mean anything for a phone? What about wear and tear? Handling? Interior? In your simplifying quest to parallel Tesla to AAPL you are leaping like no man before. TESLA is not AAPL, nor AMZN. It‚Äôs a freaking car company./n<neg> $TSLA $AAPL My Robinhood balance is way off (less) even though splits are now showing with new pricing,  and Trade Zero showing no updates. I hope @RobinhoodApp sorts out these balance issues by Monday./n<neu> @androider25 Looks like $AAPL went down on the day of the split - are you projecting the same with $TSLA, Monday? I believe it we'll have a bunch of RH investors thinking $440 is a huge discount and will push the price higher on the opening bell./n<pos> @CbianBen Hi @CbianBen thanks alot for these threads, greatly appreciated, please assist with the second frame, I don't think that's a snapshot of AAPL or am I getting it wrong?

Big money moves markets. Big Buyers create buyers, big sellers create sellers. You want to swim as close to mouth of the shark as you can without getting munched. I laughed at all the chumps buying $aapl over 5 bills/n<neu> @CbianBen I'm more convinced of $AAPL experiencing a pullback than $NFLX. I think the stock split got people looking to make quick gains riled up. $NFLX has been trading within that range for sometime now. Maybe a slight pullback and then an increase./n<neu> @Herbie71387418 @PuttermanYaron @JustAManic2020 I also expect massive buying in $APLE from traders who confuse it for $aapl. There‚Äôs always a few million of those that act. See $tlsa. They‚Äôve enjoyed a run along with Tesla cause of the moronic traders who confuse tickers./n<neu> @CbianBen No. I meant it's a different image. It's not $AAPL instead it's IBUY but I get your explanation. Thanks.
Also, is it that retail investors don't get to partake in after hours market?

If they increase their dividend, then I'll wait for the shares to increase past $300

With a little negotiation one can get a 1.6% loan for 6 months./n<neu> @yujializhai @axelroark Not mutually exclusive conditions.

If you read my articles, you would know I am unequivocally bullish on $AAPL business prospects and I am and will remain an investor. I merely think its dangerous for young, inexperienced investors to pile into a stock simply because it's splitting./n<neg> @RosserJobs Pretty much only invest in things I use/consume. $roku $penn $twtr $aapl $dal to name a few. $Twtr my most frustrating hold but it is so engrained in our lives I cant imagine it not gaining market value eventually/n<neg> @soflojc As I said earlier, Not at all. I have been long $AAPL since Jan, 2008 and $TSLA since May, 2013. I just think young, inexperienced investors will be expecting massive gains, and become disillusioned when that doesn't happen right away./n<pos> @ReviewsMall @fitformom @CarolinePerrine @JAYQ476 @mcnameewal @pacific_plum @teachbookworm @NHCountryGal @magicalmaddie8 @VannesaCasas1 @GCastillion @NicolesChoice1 @msqueennas @GlaunerLisa @abbynaverysmom @janagram80 @sweetmatcha I won 100.00 on #CashApp twitch yesterday- good luck- going to use the money to buy 1 share of @apple Monday $aapl/n<neg> How‚Äôd I miss $AAPL doing $27 drop in 30 mins üòÇ/n<neu> @alexcutler247 Both my $aapl and $tsla have been updated and I‚Äôm using Robinhood./n<pos> Would love to find out the % of $TSLA shareholders who are also Tesla owners and compare to other companies.

Expanding mults (on a flat or growing business) make every moment a time to buy right? I don't mean this with snark.

I‚Äôll reiterate again what I‚Äôve said before and that is, Apple is crash-proof.

Apple has too many services and products at all price points.

That's some pricing power!

OTH, I could say the same about prime $amzn, Spotify $spot, Apple $aapl. And I couldn't be as generous to them all. So perhaps not the pricing power ü§î/n<neu> @charliebilello @hopeseekr my shares will be divided by 4 for $aapl &amp;5 by $tsla - Apple will be 125.00 - Tesla 450.00 -presently I‚Äôm Up over 2k in Tesla - my profit will = 4 shares.

Among other factors./n<neg> @HustlerKingdom1 can‚Äôt imagine in foreseeable future selling more than maybe a third,of $AMZN esp. &amp; I‚Äôll own $AAPL forever I assume. I do doubt that it can sustain this price level for too long (even tho others have much more inflated multiples) but long term, see it as high-yield cash cow./n<neu> $TSLA $AAPL
I thought these were supposed to stop trading at the closing bell.
So is the new price going to be split against the closing price or the 8pm price?

For example phones went from passwords only to adding fingerprint sensors and then facial recognition. OKTA doesn‚Äôt own the moat and MSFT, AAPL, Huawei can easily own?/n<neu> @WoodyWiegmann @trengriffin I'll just point to an example: over the last two decades AAPL has been *both* a value stock and a growth stock. The conceptual, almost merely verbal, dichotomy cannot deal with that reality./n<neu> @jack_brooklyn7 @WilliamNextLev1 Your bet came with the indefinite time , so basically I just need to wait for aapl to hit $  500 after splitting .lol until then the bet is still on .lmao/n<pos> @aapl_mfc Works for me.../n<pos> Lower than I thought!!! $AAPL 502/4 =125.50.

Like I said on friday $AAPL actually shows constructive price and volume action but I still believe that most already bought. We might get a "stupid money" burst.../n<neg> I hope these AAPL contracts slap hard af tomorrow but I have no idea what to expect/n<neg> @taha_zafar12 @yodachewielink @kaiynne No problem. I‚Äôve had the same issue for yrs. It‚Äôs gets frustrating to know they know and still nothing. But it takes time when you have billions if not trillions to invest.

Are you looking to take a long position? üòÄ I am üëç/n<pos> I‚Äôm interested to see what happened with the $AAPL and $TSLA stock this week. #Trading #StockMarket/n<pos> @_TierraJae_ The stock split makes the share more affordable for new investors. Instead of one share of $AAPL costing $500, it‚Äôll now be $125 for one share. $TSLA is doing a one too but it‚Äôll be 5-1. Example: One share was $2,000, now it‚Äôs $400/n<pos> @BlackfishFinanc @BearingtonTrade Personally my $AAPL holding for years has outweighed the next size position by usually more than double. It‚Äôs worked for me. Warren Buffet seems to agree as well, he owns like 6% of the company. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> I don‚Äôt trade the same time frame all the time. It depends on the day and on the stock.  I can often trade AAPL off a 1 or 2 min chart, especially when it is trending. But a stock like NFLX or TSLA, I won‚Äôt go lower than 5 min and often use a 10 min. Adapt, be bendable not rigid./n<pos> @TD_DirectInvest I‚Äôm on track alright thanks to my investment in @Apple a few months ago. #buylowsellhigh. Bring on the 4 for 1 split! #aapl/n<neu> @TheMarkCooke @stockstuffsam @JonahLupton $AAPL arguably didn‚Äôt have a moat until it started developing its services sector.

When I wanted a new phone recently, thanks to the services sector, it never even occurred to me to look at Android. I‚Äôd lose too much/n<neg> @StockDweebs That's really true! I burnt my self a lot times in QQQ, SPY, AAPL, TSLA putsüò∂üôÑ/n<neu> @67Dodge @CanDivStocks Yeah, I started the skimming approach with AAPL. Planning on buying one TSLA tmrw, and I have MSFT, PYPL, JNJ on my radar. What are your four techs?/n<neu> Tomorrow the market will be in a frenzy. A part of me wants to start building a position with $TSLA . However buying more $AAPL is the safer option./n<pos> @TheNathanNS @StockDweebs It's kinda funny seeing $TTWO in their list, it's like 2 worlds colliding lol 
Personally I keep $TTWO for long term though, it can only keep increasing. Similar to $AAPL and $MSFT/n<neu> After the splits

I'm swimming in 

$AAPL &amp; $TSLA/n<neg> @CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Well, Duh!

And this is why $AAPL advances while $MSFT makes money by "renting" programmes instead of selling them

I'll try on last analogy bc people don't understand what a share of stock represents.

The year is 2025 - thanks to JPow a KitKat bar costs $4. They decide to do a 4 for 1 split. 

The new KitKat will only cost $1 but you only get 1 wafer not 4.

Their stocks represent an endorphin rush that‚Äôs been given a nitrous boost by Draftking $‚Äôs.

The price drops but the split amount, but shares outstanding increase. 

So with $AAPL, the stock ‚Äúdropped‚Äù by a divisor of 4, but shares outstanding increase by 4. 

Net affect is no change on market cap./n<neg> @lunchboxtrades Lmfaooo üò≠üò≠üò≠ I still don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna financially recover from KTOV until TSLA and AAPL start rippin... orrrr if SWBI earnings are as good as I‚Äôm thinking they will be and that dips back to its price before this real bad dip after the spin off lol/n<pos> @jack_brooklyn7 Thanks for reading my tweets.

Quit thinking certain stocks aren't extended because they

I'm sorry but it doesn't work that way!/n<neu> Too many people think $AAPL is extended you're right!

Quite preaching long term and then say its overextended!

You wouldn‚Äôt think AAPL has autonomous driving tech team, but they do(not a secret anymore). Many other projects. A.I. part of AAPL is kicking in...yes it will shake off weak hands but this technology unstoppable./n<neg> @jayemonet i was so mad at Ally for continually cutting my savings rates that I took most of my savings out and put it in AAPL like a month or two ago...20% is a lot better than 1% annually LOL/n<pos> Did one long on Nasdaq today. Closed it down early but still a good going. Happy. Bought back the fractional share part of my $AAPL slightly higher but I don't mind it. $SHOP is on the go. I'm still down but that's due to my UK exposure. Tomorrow should be positive./n<neg> The only thing this whole apple thing tells me is the economy is about to crash and everyone is going with it.

AAPL vs PSV day trading/n<neu> I‚Äôm long some $AAPL here. I think we see fresh eyes on this chart at this price for a move into the close. We will see if I‚Äôm on the right idea. 

#ICEMAN/n<neg> @RJStephens77 @Miss_Rile @EasyEquities @Apple @Tesla At market close on friday night my $AAPL and $TSLA stocks were both over 50%+ over the last few months. After the stock splits I'm in the negative 60s. Stock splits aren't supposed to do this. I will give them a chance to fix this bug üòÇüòÇüòÇ/n<neu> AAPL has split 4 for 1. 
TSLA split 5 for 1.

I'm under the impression this is the path forward to the next collapse. 

Amazon stock $3470. Remember those "Bezos is on deck to being the first trillionaire" articles? Just you wait until Amazon splits stock and is more accessible./n<pos> @AU_Pops It is.

As they split, now is a better time than ever to get into this company for the long term. I currently own 4 shares, and plan to grow and hold it for at least a decade./n<pos> now
$TSLA It happened. I am now the proud owner of 2 Tesla shares and 2 $AAPL shares (yes, I am very aware that I'm not rich and 2 shares of each are nothing compared to most of you).üòÅüòÅüòÅ 

Sold half of my $RKT and half $DPHC to get in.

#GetRichorDieTrying/n<neu> Morning in small cap was slooooow. I didn't take one trade. Sometimes, the best trade is no trade. Don't force trades out of boredom.  Have been going over small lessons. 

$TSLA $AAPL - Will hold until the market tells me to sell some pieces.

#daytrading/n<neu> Lots of back and forth today (i.e$ BYND $WKHS $BILI) 

Are they gunna use $TSLA and $AAPL splits for one last thrust up before some needed consolidation?/n<pos> @ScottBProfitLy That is $AAPL from now on
So i guess these are  quite common in Panama! lol atleast good to see people let them "take their time"/n<pos> Taking advantage of those $AAPL and $TSLA splits was the smartest thing I‚Äôve ever done investment wise. I know it‚Äôs going to pay off so my cheap ass isn‚Äôt even mad about having to put that money up./n<neu> @ripster47 I meant 130 lmao it‚Äôs been a long time seeing AAPL at this price. Still have to mentally adjust/n<neu> I was just over here screaming about $TSLA like a man does when he's watching football 

#TSLA #AAPL #StockSplit/n<neu> $ORCL

Going all in on $WMT WALMART and when they buy #tiktok, ORACL will drop.

Since the news should be this week, I am looking to capitalize quickly.

Not a long hold at all.

#stocks $aapl $AMZN $tsla/n<neu> @fundhunter_co I am talking about excitement about the stock. 

I could put charts of tech companies too - Cisco or Qualcomm in 1999.  Nothing fundamentally happened to $AAPL or $TSLA over last 60 days

This is just a reminder that when companies get divorced from fundamentals - gravity wins/n<pos> I know in the grand scheme of things, it all ends up the same, but a 4-1 split for $aapl and a 5-1 for $tsla is still exciting. It's like starting over with 5x the amount I started with.  üçªüòòüççüçï/n<pos> @SilviaBellrock I'm ok with that...and with $AAPL back at $500./n<pos> $AAPL I am long and strong/n<neu> @bob4punk We'll see who's stronger now--my cold streak vs. TSLA and AAPL. I have 4x 148.75/150 c-d-s for AAPL for 9/18 for .30 total (previously 595/600 we discussed) and just snagged a 780/800 c-d-s for TSLA for 9/18 for .43.

#aapl/n<pos> all of the youngins that invested into AAPL and/or TSLA this morning, i‚Äôm proud of you./n<pos> $TSLA I mean, on a PEG ratio basis, this is cheaper than $aapl still./n<neg> @Vanguard_Group Vanguard. this happens WAY To often to you guys. no idea what the excuse is this time, but if it's the AAPL/TSLA split you've had 2 weeks to get ready for that. how can we feel comfortable entrusting you with our assets in these turbulent times if we can't even access them/n<neu> @JimmiieSnuka let me look into m1. My aapl stock is on E*TRADE./n<pos> @caroljsroth I certainly feel motivated this morning with $AAPL stock up 3%. So I do have all the Apple toys: IPod, iPhone10, iPad &amp; miniMac. Since I was the PC guy, when I bought these products these past 9 years, they were wants. Now I think I need them!/n<neu> $AAPL not looking to be a hero on these names today. Take the high probability set up and good r/r -- and move on re scale if trend fails. Otherwise avoid front side of move.

11:34:47 am InvestorsLive: sized down bunch AAPL re scale if this recent low starts to firm up as top/n<neu> If you really didn't buy $AAPL or $TSLA before the split.. first of all why not?

Don't live in the past but friends, now seems like a good time for entry.

I am not a financial advisor. Only invest money you can afford to./n<neu> at 130.05 all time high so far, we can now round $aapl actual earnings to a 40 multiple.  I remember when it was near 15./n<pos> @avgodfather When I look at the other FANGAM stocks, the one that I believe is most likely to be relevant 100 years from now is $AMZN.

If $AAPL successfully executes on their vision to be known a healthcare company then maybe them too./n<neu> I sold 135/140 $AAPL call spread expiring this Friday.  

Bearish. 

$AAPL is not going to 136 this week./n<neu> Should I buy $tsla? Or $aapl/n<neu> @StockLizardKing $aapl sell off at the moment/n<neu> I'd have thought swapping out low priced $XOM, $PFE &amp; $RTX for high priced $AMGN, $CRM &amp; $HON would give an unreal 1000 point artificial boost to price based DJIA (even adjusting for $AAPL split price &amp; assuming divisor unchanged)

But I guess that's why I sit in my basement 24/7/n<neg> Made a small bit today but I don‚Äôt like the way $AAPL was acting . Like it was being forced to go up .

$TSLA quick 60% on calls/n<neu> I‚Äôm closely monitoring $TSLA and $AAPL for an entry point/n<neg> TSLA and AAPL rallying on a meaningless stock split isn't so different from trading platforms making big deals about "technicals" and "earnings misses."

The fact a DCF today has like 70+% of its value in TV makes these indicators even more bizarre./n<pos> Its been a productive morning for me:

‚úÖMeditated
‚úÖHit Chest &amp; Shoulders
‚úÖBought some $TSLA &amp; more $AAPL
‚úÖSourced a rare toy &amp; more inventory

Ending this month on a high note.

I'll share my sales numbers later today./n<neg> @SethNovick I jokingly told my wife ‚Äúif I didn‚Äôt like someone and they asked me to manage their money and I purposely wanted to lose it, I would buy them AAPL/TSLA on Monday‚Äù ‚Äî lately every time I think a trade is dumb or high risk, it goes straight to the moon. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> @asemota For me its $YUMC, $TSLA and $AAPL that are green, others are red but overall I'm still going up./n<pos> I bought 100 shares in $AAPL and I'm waiting on $TSLA to gap down for entry. This stock split is super lit./n<pos> @CalebGregory304 I got a few shares of $AAPL today!/n<neu> @RetirementRight To help me get a short position in $TSLA and $AAPL/n<neg> Old school and value traders get another lesson today. Adapt or die. As I have said before things change and I don't care you made money 10-20 years ago. Simply not relevant. $AAPL $TSLA $ARKK/n<neg> AAPL 138.75c 9/11 ????? I need a mentor or something cause I‚Äôm bouta yolo my life away/n<neu> @Alexxussh Did you get into TSLA or AAPL? I got in and out lol/n<pos> @RetroWallSt You can't exclude AAPL's excellent earnings as an additional reason the stock went up. They handily beat estimates. I agree that the split announcement added to the excitement/price increase. However, AMZN is up 400 points since their earnings on the same date...with no split./n<neg> I sold half of my $AAPL stocks last year thinking the market was a goner.

Lesson learned: Never try to time the market. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> @frankshi3d I knooooow stocking up on $aapl was much easier/n<neg> Aug 31 Monday, $AAPL is $128.68

I had $aapl at $240 back in March. I sold because I thought it was going to hit $215. Stupid play, eh? I ended up waiting until June to buy again, and I missed a move of over $100 per share. ü§Æ It happens./n<neu> @InvestorsLive wait what did you say abt aapl???? thats what i thoughtü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> @sunglassesface Heck TSLA, I'm on that AAPL kick. 4-1 split and the to the MOOON/n<neu> Robinhood app acting stupid today!!

Looked at my stock ticker.
TSLA had dropped to under $500. 
Fuck - that was $2000/share loss ... then remembered it was split day for TSLA &amp; AAPL. I am up $63k for the day. Thats just under 3x my annual salary at the moment. Its only paper until you cash out though./n<neu> $AAPL just hit the Equivalent of $520.

üëåüèº/n<neu> I would advise yall to buy aapl today !!/n<neu> QOTD: Should I invest more into $TSLA or buy into $AAPL ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #noidea/n<neu> @darjohn25 I guess I'm YOLOing LOL.....tho I'm doing Straddles with Deep ITM $aapl calls/n<neg> @ChicoBonds Picked up some more of AAPL but that TSLA stock is still too rich for my blood. Plus I still don‚Äôt fully trust Musk not to do something reckless at some point. Hope I‚Äôm wrong./n<neu> I remember when Buffet first bought $AAPL around $92 per share few years back.

I guess we can now get in at similar levels ü§£ü§£/n<neu> @anilvohra69 Hmm.. I think he is sufficiently smart enough to not let "accounting purposes" considerations preventing him from making good investments... after all he also has no majority in $AAPL

But I understand, that he likes to take medium sized businesses private when yield &gt; Treasuries/n<pos> @HeavensCrush @Siggyv My Charles schwab app is working and yeah it's only 1038am and I've made out alright with my $AAPL. It started this morning at like $126 which is the bargain of all bargains. I bought it after it split 7-1 a few years back. These splits are the gift that keeps giving lol/n<neg> Looking at the insanity that‚Äôs going on in $tsla $aapl $amzn I really think if Trump wins $spx can easily hit 4000 in December/n<neu> @denimdannnnn @WallStreetYoda I sent them an email and cleared right up afterwards. Both the AAPL and also subsequent RKT positions./n<neg> $AAPL the teenagers couldn't buy Apple and Tesla fast enough and knocked down the Robinhood app.  I was wondering why gains were so muted./n<pos> $TSLA &amp; $AAPL good thing I stacked on them before the split üôèüèº/n<neg> I‚Äôm trying to throw 1k in AAPL but they not letting me üò°üò°üò°/n<neg> Look at ur $Tesla  and $AAPL stock rn  if u wanna either feel rich or dumb for not putting thousands inü§Ø/n<pos> @HappenMike @JLugo_3 Yeah AAPL 100% the safer option. TSLA just has the higher upside I guess you could say lol. A lot more risk though./n<pos> $aapl $tsla keeping me green today! On a crazy Monday morning!/n<neu> @vixologist Yes, because DJIA is price weighted, not cap weighted thus AAPL at 1/5 the price will have a lower impact. I do not know the exact conversion/weighting./n<neg> DKNG didnt get the move I expected this morning. I'm still sitting on my hands not forcing anything or chasing aapl or tsla/n<neu> Finally got into $AAPL today... wished I did it a month ago. Average cost is $127.50/n<neg> @RobinhoodApp the 1day graph. doesn't seem right today. shows my equity has come down by 40%. I'm guessing this is because of the AAPL stock. ????/n<pos> @RealJamesWoods I know you are smiling today with the AAPL split...I followed your lead and bought it in March, when the Market ‚Äúcrashed‚Äù. Hats off to you, James, and thank you!/n<neu> Buy as much AAPL and TSLA as you can right now ... thank me later/n<neu> I know this is a sports gambling account but I‚Äôm gonna be handing out free money however possible . Go buy $tsla and $aapl this morning/n<neg> @Duderichy I honestly can't tell if you're fucking with me. 
$AAPL had a 1:4 split./n<neu> I am gping to stock split the price of my house. $AAPL $TSLA./n<neu> Investing 4K into my future today. That same 4K will turn into AT LEAST 20k before I get a chance to miss that investment money &amp; even then I‚Äôm STILL HOLDING and still loading on shares w $tsla and $aapl üôÇ
Watch me werk./n<neg> I wonder if people with large equity in their homes ever think about how much money they are losing by not owning AAPL?/n<pos> these $TSLA &amp; $AAPL calls never did me dirty always stayed faithful üòéüìà/n<pos> @RampCapitalLLC Splits are always good and tasty $AAPL $TSLA

I think Ben Graham said that in Intelligent Investor/n<neu> I‚Äôd like to buy some AAPL stock but idk what I‚Äôm doing so there‚Äôs that../n<neu> @RSInvestor I still believe in the "window dressing" effect - I have no evidence that this persists.  Holders of managed accts will still expect to see FAANGs on their monthly statements - tech unlikely to dive today.  And AAPL &amp; TSLA split hype needs to pass... ridiculous behavioral psych/n<neg> I wonder how many brokerages messed up the stop loss orders on $TSLA and $AAPL this morning./n<neu> @JDollas26 @eljay25thleo I got in on aapl and tsla/n<pos> If there's one stock I always buy without thinking twice, it's Apple $AAPL, you can't go wrong with it/n<pos> Call me crazy, but just bought $AAPL and plan on holding for a very long time.  Thought I was crazy in Oct 2016 when I bought $AMZN too.  Still holding $AMZN. If holding long works for Warren, why can't it work for me? :)/n<neu> Already had a few ppl text me that they finally ‚Äúwere able‚Äù to buy their first shares of $AAPL / $TSLA today #stocks/n<pos> I did it.  Short$MMM, Long$AAPL./n<neg> $TSLA $AAPL This minus loss showing because of the splits is really bothering me. Wish they‚Äôd make it green so it‚Äôs not a psychological mind fuck. Happy for the extra shares though looks cool./n<neu> Consensus from the people I follow / talk to was that $TSLA $AAPL would crash after the split. Not surprised they're higher (so far at least)/n<neu> @JustShemaBaby i still rather take the 2% on $AAPL !/n<neu> I hope the ppl buying into AAPL today, bought long term, cause why would you go short..../n<neg> Think I bought the wrong expiry on AAPL the time dilation is hurting it even though its gaining/n<neu> @stoolpresidente Just sold all of my shares of the #woat for $aapl got to make back the money I lost now/n<neu> Who wanna give me some money for an AAPL contract?

No one? Ok. üòÇ/n<neg> üò´ I should have listened to @RiskReversal and @NorthmanTrader they were right all along! My $AAPL and $TSLA stocks are only worth 25% what they were on Friday! Im sorry for doubting you guys!!/n<neu> Last week, somebody asked me if they should buy AAPL only because they will get more shares when it splits. They didn‚Äôt know about anything else

We are nearing a top/n<pos> @DATRUTH5454 Hopefully soon. I bought in more, under $128. AAPL is now in my top 5 within RRSP and top 10 across full portfolio. Gulp... Hope it goes to work now!/n<neu> We'll see how $WKHS $TSLA and $AAPL can hold up in the LTG portfolio. 

I'm also starting to build my travel portfolio back up again. Will post that once complete./n<pos> @heyRickyB Nice gains, way to go. I have some shares in both AAPL and TSLA as well./n<neu> @jonp201Invst Honestly, blue chip companies.  I‚Äôve got a list and slowly trying to pick up my US market portfolio.  Right now my US portfolio is $AAPL, $MSFT, $JNJ, and $PFE.

Got a spreadsheet and when I have my buying days try and see which ones are the good buys./n<pos> I mean $AAPL at that price feels like a no brainer/n<neu> So, should I sell of my shares of $RKT and $DPHC to buy in on $TSLA and $AAPL??

Now, I am not balling here. I would only acquire $2,600+ for selling my shares to split between the 2 stocks or all in on one of them./n<neu> @GregMannarino I sold $AAPL options at 6:31 and it went through 10 minutes ago/n<neu> @basilnsage Question Mr. Steve, if I may. With AAPL split, what's the impact on MAGFA with AAPL having 1/4 of the impacts as it did before?/n<pos> $AAPL #AAPL split looking solid thus far, I like long / calls./n<neg> RH is hold the orders as pending for over 5 minutes. Tell me what does that means for trading? #stocks #stockmarket Worst execution ever. #robinhood #MondayMorning #mondaythoughts $AAPL $TSLA #split #postsplit/n<pos> @naninani6 Thank you! Was a fabulous albeit short, road trip. Already looking forward to the next one!

As for $AAPL and $TSLA, I am less concerned about the entry than I am the hold. Will probably "fence" up more positions today or tomorrow. Want to see the split trading settle down first/n<neu> I hope y‚Äôall copped those new $AAPL &amp; $TSLA stocks ../n<neg> I guess $AAPL &amp; $TSLA crashed Robinhood./n<neu> @petenajarian I bought the 120.00 short-dated puts on $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL Ameritrade isn‚Äôt opening for me, but I was able to execute orders on Thinkorswim without an issue/n<pos> I reckon we should see $AAPL back at 500 by EOD, get another split next week. Seems fair./n<neu> Finally an $AAPL owner but I'm still going to be "tweeting from Android" for a while/n<pos> $AAPL options going crazy today I'm hype/n<pos> When I worked at $AAPL as a specialist, I did more to enhance and advance deaf accessibility. The boss gave me stocks and a pay raise. I never bought anything in stocks outside of crypto. I rather earn and get rewarded in stocks./n<neu> @StockDweebs How do u feel ab the $tsla and $aapl splits?/n<neg> @wolftradingbg This is crazy 

This is such bubble mentality especially in TSLA and AAPL r just nuts 

I will be surprised if this pop isn't sold off ( i expect to be surprised)/n<neg> What are the nerds investing in? 

When I was busy partying my life away they were buying bitcoin, crypto currencies, and $AMZN $FB $AAPL stocks. 

Yeah I‚Äôm not fucking miss out on the next revolution./n<neu> @RedlerAllAccess Still? Thought you entered week with no AAPL. Must've been a buy this AM/n<neu> Morning! 5 with Fitz

#intowin/n<neu> Sold 1 $AAPL call, hedged my option so I can be a little riskier knowing I already have profit, 3 left/n<neu> @TDAmeritrade  So, funny thing.  I got a SECURITIES ALERT that AAPL had gone below 130. Yeah, it did.  But you may not want to give such an alert when the stock split and actually went UP, not down, afterwards./n<neg> @Miamistocktrade @WallStreetYoda yeah it's really annoying, luckily I was able to scale out and I think I just made slightly above break even but I woke up with 28 $AAPL calls so I was trying to sell 25 ASAP. Good luck. Charles Schwab isn't really working for me either/n<pos> Hey $AAPL, I love you!!/n<neu> AAPL split, pls go buy so I make money ü§ëü§ëü§ë/n<pos> I bought $AAPL because I couldn't buy the iPad Pro since it's launch, that worked out nicely ü§ë/n<neg> Ok, I folded.

I‚Äôm about to go to WeBull full time, I bought an AAPL and got email confirmation for the order but didn‚Äôt get filled and got nothing on the app. Garbage/n<neu> @TheAlgoholic Had no idea what you were talking about til i saw AAPL price, heart skipped a beat/n<neu> Love selling naked put #options on $AAPL $TSLA. Huge premiums on $TSLA a stock that's heading dramatically higher. Now more affordable to the masses. 

As legendary horse trainer John Campo said "Go get the money suckers." Only problem, I wasn't smart enough to bet his horse./n<neg> LMAO TD AMERITRADE IS LAGGING FROM PEOPLE PROB BUYING AAPL AND TSLA KEEP MAKING ME FUNDS FOLKS/n<neu> ok i'll play 
Dow would be 70 points higher without the $AAPL split/n<pos> I hate Apple products but I love $AAPL. Time to reload and watch the stock run up to the 400s again in a few years./n<neg> $TSLA $AAPL It‚Äôs very shocking how much of the crowd is unaware of what‚Äôs going on. The stock split for both of these stock has been on the news for a few weeks now and people here are completely clueless?!?! I got to get off this platform. Too many ü§°/n<neu> UNG broke down and stopped me out... agq and aapl more than making up for it though!/n<neg> Shit I forgot to get $AAPL...9-5 messing up my money lol/n<neu> I don't understand it. If you're a long-term investor in aapl, 
then if 4x v 5x the shares allows for more holders to generate option premium, then a portion of premium should be re-invested in tsla in order to create a cyclic system of increased ownership of shares?/n<neu> @Pharmdca i added more to my current shares $TSLA &amp; $AAPL/n<pos> @DThack03 Woke up early this morning to get a jump on the $aapl split. I know its gonna be a good week ‚úäüèΩ/n<neg> @RobinhoodApp you guys knew there would be high traffic volume of people trading early to buy into $AAPL and $TSLA. Now my cued orders to buy and sell shares are stalled and I‚Äôm missing out on Apple‚Äôs high gains.

I just took $AAPL for 1.56 a share. Gonna wait for things to cool off on aapl now and then buy some for a long-term hold./n<neu> I totally just bought some shares of $aapl. Inflow is loaded right now. Only 6 minutes into market open... ü•¥/n<neg> Is anyone else having issues buying and selling on @RobinhoodApp today? I can‚Äôt buy or sell any of my $AAPL or $MSFT/n<neg> Robinhood customer support lines going ballistic today with AAPL holders wondering why their account isn't up 8x this AM.

"I was 2X levered in AAPL into the split! WTF?"/n<neg> feel bad for the folks seeing AAPL and TSLA up '300-400%' in their portfolios not realizing that their stocks split and they have the same value that they did before lmao/n<neu> 2 minutes before opening bell and I feel like a child on Christmas morning waiting on #AAPL &amp; #TSLA .... splits are such a big deal ü§ó/n<neu> @jimcramer I think it's about time to update the "FAANG" acronym...with today's 2 splits it is now more accurate to call them "FANTAAM" (phantom) 
$FB $AAPL $NFLX $TSLA $AMZN $GOOGL(Alpha) $MSFT/n<pos> If you took my previous webinars this summer I talked about volume &amp; especially volume during a split- example was $AAPL through the years- wonderful  example now is $TSLA and how charts are reflecting a new price/volume relationship. Adjusting the proportions of the pyramid!/n<pos> @OfficiallyMWill I hope both $TSLA and $AAPL see some strong post-split gains./n<neu> If I have $30k to invest, what would your recommend? $TSLA? $AAPL? or $NIO?/n<neu> $AAPL 3-1 daily.

Let's see what happens üòé

*Not financial advice, do your own research, speak to an expert, fun and entertainment ONLY*

#Apple #Tesla #stocks #StockMarket/n<neg> @tastytrade Why is the interface still not showing correct prices for my AAPL and TSLA? I can't buy a call because it shows old prices (pre-split)/n<neu> I'm totally focused on $tsla and $aapl this morning; I'm hoping my trading account splits these in time for the open. I'm seeing mixed numbers. ü§Ø/n<pos> The watch list has been loaded in the Discord Room!

The room already has been put on notice for $AAPL!

Like I said before with new information you have to adapt!

Trade Safe &amp; Good Luck!/n<pos> Interesting to see what will happen to $AAPL and $TSLA these next few days.

I'm thinking it might be easier for some portfolios to rebalance and might expect a bit of a sell off./n<neu> @TradeFloorAudio How much $AAPL should I buy today then?/n<neu> $AAPL down 75% wait until you see the gurus and their short profit!

In case you don‚Äôt know, I know./n<pos> I still buy the split because more people are able to afford the stock which should in turn increase the value... look at $AAPL after the 7-1 split STONKS only go up üìà/n<neu> @WallStreetYoda Besides the $AAPL / $MSFT calls I'm in suffering today, kinda would welcome a red day lol./n<neu> üçé and ‚ö°Ô∏è split day.

A pair trade I will be in shortly, long $AAPL while short $TSLA. 

Price targets $250 and $100./n<neu> Stock spilted don‚Äôt panic ex: I own 1 stock yesterday today I have 5 $tsla $AAPL/n<pos> @fitz_keith wow right back into the fire!  Hope your road trip with your bride was great! The Picts were awesome.  I‚Äôm with ya on adding aapl have never had Tesla but want to... trying to figure an entry/n<neg> @naturalkap @ChillingWithKD Tell em. Been so frustrating educating amateur investors like this. Wait a minute, You know what, it actually makes sense. The investors who don't even understand how something as basic as stock split works is the reason why the pps of TSLA &amp; AAPL was so high in the 1st place/n<neu> #aapl and #tsla stock splits complete. Weird to see them trading at such low prices now.. am curious to see the price impact after this change. set your levels and be ready in case they jump/n<neg> I totally forgot about TSLA‚Äôs and AAPL‚Äôs stock split today and thought they went bankrupt overnight üòÖ/n<pos> @fitz_keith @Varneyco @FoxBusiness Completely agree that $AAPL and $TSLA will be heading higher post splits. I‚Äôll be putting more positions on both./n<neg> Watching these Tesla AAPL tweets really shows me y'all don't understand securities as much as you like to tell everyone lol/n<pos> Keylevel for stop loss has been set up. I'm ready $AAPL./n<neu> $AAPL   5,358,430 shares  $ 137.29

#MondayMorning #stocks #StockMarket #mondaythoughts/n<neu> @trader_RH94 Question for you...if I wanted to buy 400 of $AAPL....should I buy it all at open? Or save some in case it goes down?
My gut tells me it might just shoot up though. What do you think?/n<pos> Any money I win. I‚Äôm reinvesting into stocks tbh. $aapl and $tsla/n<pos> @coinyeezy also that market capitalization of many US tech stocks greater than GDP of most countries e.g. $AAPL mc &gt; GDP of Russia etc

this would theoretically make me bullish on twetch/n<neg> $AAPL added $500B and $TSLA added $160B to their mkt caps after announcing stock splits a few weeks ago. Yet, analysts continue to tell me that stock splits provide no value to shareholders (10 singles is worth the same as a $10 bill). Obviously, they do not own these two stocks./n<neu> @SquawkCNBC Nothing makes sense in this market. Time for $AAPL and $TSLA to double in value in the next week lol/n<neg> I am so old I remember AAPL dropping 50% in a day without a split./n<neu> @fienixtaranova i grabbed more AAPL but i already had some/n<neu> Will $AAPL and $TSLA splits mark the top in $SPY  and $QQQ ?

How are you playing either stock or the ETFs?/n<pos> Goood morning and happy Monday!! $TSLA and $AAPL are my two main focuses this morning.

I knew these companies were trash!/n<neu> @zerohedge $TSLA will split today.  @AMZN may in the not too distant future.  @AAPL is also splitting 4 for 1.  I don't see $MSFT splitting again in the near future./n<neu> $CRM is the new $AAPL in the $INDU $DIA
At $125-ish, big moves in $AAPL will have less impact on the index 

$UNH $HD $CRM $AMGN should split too

A price-based index w/ components from $39 to $310 makes little sense/n<neg> everyone GOOD MORNING! AAPL and TSLA are now 125 and 444 respectively...

Lol these numbers just don‚Äôt make sense to me yet/n<neg> I‚Äôm going to wait a couple days before I buy more $AAPL shares. 50/50 shot this tweet wont age well after saying that./n<neg> @Convertbond "I‚Äôm sure Warren Buffett is a great guy but when it comes to stocks he‚Äôs washed up. I‚Äôm the captain now." - Portnoy.  While I would agree some of his legacy positions have sucked (WFC etc) but his AAPL was a home run and he is buying a ton of commodities right now./n<neu> With the $AAPL and $TSLA splits. I would imagine option activity could be even higher than normal with investors selling calls with their higher share counts. Just a thought but wonder how that effects trading moving forward in the short term./n<neg> @TJReazor Hoping $AAPL $WMT goes even higher. Just looked &amp; saw the split on $APPL. Mistake buy: $KODK thankfully, didn't buy enough to feel pain, just the pain of stupidity. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è/n<pos> Waiting the bell to buy few shares of $AAPL I think it is an easy entry/n<pos> @HappenMike I definitely like AAPL because it probably is safer.

It shows my 25 $AAPL shares that I bought for $408 are now 100 at $476 for some reason... and that I‚Äôm down $35k on that position, instead of being up by more than $2k. ü§®/n<neu> Good morning.

Mind blown $SPX/n<pos> I was thinking disruption and investment yesterday night. See $AAPL, $TSLA, $AMZN. Massive value creation spanning over a decade+ on the back of redefining the rules in a well established market (smartphones, cars, retail and IT infrastructure). 1/3/n<pos> $tsla and $aapl are the easiest buys right now. Especially for the future. 

I personally will load up on Tesla.

Tomorrow marks new split prices of $TSLA &amp; $AAPL 

The crowd anticipates it to run up. I plan on securing another 12 or so $AAPL which will leave me with 640 common stock of Apple, and I have 5 Tesla.

Long holds./n<neu> @pakpakchicken $AAPL OR $TSLA...i can't decide/n<neg> @sapna987 What do you think of $TSLA, $AAPL, $AMZN 9/4 options?  Do they go up this week? I have been for weeks now.

Am i right or wrong??/n<neu> Watching $AAPL and $TSLA closely tomorrow. There should be a lot of price action. At this point, it can still go either way..but I'm more of the long side since folks will always try to get in with the lower price. Going to trade the trend./n<neg> @TimSweeneyEpic I see few supporting bully aapl but give no valid arguments why consumers cannot have a alternative choices.

Appl is just a big bully and have been extorting everyobe with nice fake smile!

Both $TSLA &amp; $AAPL split. I want to see how it acts before I make a move./n<neu> Question: Does the wash sale rule complete itself after I have "paid back" my losses?

AAPL, AMZN, TSLA.  I'm sure folks will be buying calls on those too.  Lol/n<pos> I bought in to the #TSLA &amp; #AAPL stock split because

HOME 21/22 for 9/18: 0.40
TSLA 780/800 for 9/18: 0.57
RKT 25/26 for 9/18: 0.50
3x AAPL 148.75/150: 0.14

I'm bullish that HOME, RKT finish fully ITM (0.95). I expect AUY to double up to 0.50+; AAPL/TSLA: who knows/n<neg> @AblessedLeo Holy fuck bro I did t even know AAPL split yesterday ü§Øü§Ø/n<neg> @lx1906 @borrowed_ideas Honestly this is what I am hoping for. Long term, $AAPL stock price appreciation is terrible for buy and hold, since they went from buying back 6% of total shares a year to under 2%, I think Buffet calls it a false friend. Happy to let them keep buying back shares affordably./n<pos> @petenajarian @jonnajarian guys I‚Äôm up over 132% just since mid May on your option strategies. Currently have 4 $AAPL 9/25 $142.5 calls at 98% profit and once it goes to 100%, selling 2 and holding the rest. Can‚Äôt thank you enough! Now if I can just find time to finish your book!/n<pos> @jimcramer Nice! @dandonttweet You made me look - for me my cost basis on $AAPL is $18 in my Roth and $28 in my "MAD MONEY" Bucket for me. Yay!!!
Love you @jimcramer  - learning much from you! $EVRI and $PLUG have been great since you gave your blessing too!/n<neu> That volume at the end got me thinking $AAPL the last 10 minutes of trading NEWS COMING SOON AAPL/n<pos> $34 pre split from June 07 for $aapl so now about 11 bucks. Love it.  Bought $amzn the same day at $77. Thanks Jim! RT @dandonttweet: @karenfinerman The day @jimcramer tells me to sell $AAPL is the day I sell Apple. My cost basis is $23./n<neg> $SONO Head phone news is interesting, but not a great innovation. If anything makes them less appealing to AAPL take over being that they already have headphone hardware &amp; the Beats line. Not sure what's coming for this company... Disappointing share price for sure./n<pos> @bob4punk LOL. None, man-- WMT and DG wiped me out. My baby-sized plays, though, I'm happy to share:

2x AUY 6c for 9/11; avg of 0.24/c

TSLA 780/800 for 9/18 [LOL!]; 0.43/s
RKT 25/26 for 9/18; 0.47/s
3x AAPL 148.75/150; .075/s/n<neg> @kylewdennis Got 20% on the AAPL overnight hold. Using my phone, I couldn‚Äôt tell what u bought b/c screen is so small. Could you say what you‚Äôre doing while u do it?/n<neu> I met a hot chick and we just got off the phone. She told me that she trades $TSLA options on her WeBull account, is part of a Discord group, and doesn‚Äôt really know what options are but $AAPL and $TSLA are ‚Äúthe ones‚Äù you buy calls on. #TrueStory/n<neu> @karenfinerman The day @jimcramer tells me to sell $AAPL is the day I sell Apple. My cost basis is $23./n<neu> So the only thing I have done today trading-wise is raise a couple of stops while trying so hard to be patient ü•± while üèÑthese swells. $AAPL $SPY/n<pos> Awesome start to the new month for me, +$12,921 on the day thanks to awesome $PASO $ATDS runs despite my missing perfect $GAXY $BRTXQ panic dip buys, sooooo much opportunity in these OTCs plays right now, sorry Robinhooders, go play with your $AAPL $TSLA $ZM congrats to everyone!/n<neg> @karenfinerman I get it but that's a lot of thinking to explain away yesterday's volume and that all the buying had been nearly exhausted. 

Guess what, let's just call $AAPL bullish until it isn't. 

Today's advance blows your logic out of the water./n<pos> @AreTee2960 I did the same but not $AAPL, I got into $BRTXQ and did well./n<neu> For now, I‚Äôm maintaining our ROIC target asset allocations, but I am emphasizing that I AM NOT chasing stocks at elevated valuations. This obviously includes $TSLA, of which I have sold off all my shares recently, and stocks like $AAPL./n<neg> I did not get enough of $SHLL when it hovered around $20. I made sure to not make that mistake with $FMCI. Not saying it‚Äôs going to $46 right now lol, but this bad boy will hit $30 pre merger and will hike.

$LCA $GMHI $DKNG $NKLA $TSLA $AAPL $TRNE $CCXX $GNOG/n<neu> @SuisunDan @Windows @Apple I bought AAPL. Does that count?/n<pos> I just read one of the tickers that said that $AAPL is up so much because institutions are too short gamma and need to buy the securities underlying. Honestly that's the most rational reasoning for why its up 4%/n<neu> There is too much FOMO in the market. I am trying to not hold too many positions overnight. There may be a pullback tomorrow after a bunch of names up. #trading #investing

Certainly is concerning with this level of frothiness. And while i believe we're in a secular bull mkt with 10-yrs to run, there will be bumps along the way. #due/n<neu> so i guess tomorrow we will get some $aapl price target hikes.../n<neu> @zhaojinyu99 Yeah I actually did.

Unlike others I have proof, receipts, and free methods. Once I get good I‚Äôm charging $100 month./n<neg> @LibertyRPF Price / performance to me is a negative metric. It shows inability to increase prices at will (moat). If performance is increasing, but price is steady, NVDA cannot increase price and/or customers are unwilling to pay more.

Shhh, don't tell the millennials that./n<neu> @mcm_ct @mcm_ct_markets My friend told me last Friday he bot AAPL 550 call. In hindsight, what a smart decision. We know for sure those robinhooders will rush in now this is a 75% haircut in price. Now, at 135 = 540 before. He is minting money with his OTM calls./n<neg> @needacoin watching at the pics, I would say nothing could go wrong. Just dump all your savings, play big! could not go worse than $TSLA or $AAPL...love this era rationality :-) too bad I am too boring and busy following this trade/n<neu> @awealthofcs Its based on the market perception that $AAPL has transitioned from a h/w co to a services co with recurring revenues i.e robust CFs - the revenue mix has changed and that partly explains the higher multiples despite the marginal growth in profitability/n<neu> traded some of my AAPL stock for TSLA &amp; idk if I made a good decision lol./n<neu> @Telegraph The Bank Of England could do ¬£1trillion in QE.

It feels like erasing history./n<neu> Should I dump another $1000 into $AAPL Ô£ø?/n<neg> @JustShemaBaby Ok! That‚Äôs what I thought just wondering since I‚Äôm going long term I went with aapl but day trading always comes up and I get nervous ü§£/n<pos> @Kathy_Alyssa Yeah I feel you! I would suggest investing when you personally feel comfortable where you‚Äôre at financially. Because some people would say buying both $AAPL and $TSLA is like having a savings account. Their future is so so bright./n<pos> @agentamador @Kathy_Alyssa i bought at 1800. $tsla &amp; #aapl are holding up the economy right now. go for it/n<neu> @jeremymday Over the last 100 years I wonder how many stocks have returned 12,000% in a 10 years or less? I bet $TSLA is the only one.  I don‚Äôt even think $AAPL $AMZN $NFLX $NVDA or $MNST pulled it off. They have since their IPO‚Äôs but that‚Äôs 20-30 years in most cases. Doing it in 10 is nuts./n<neu> - $Aapl will expand screen size this go around 

- New headphones, smart watch, IPad Air and smaller home pod coming

These are all rumors don‚Äôt quote me but if it happens quote me!/n<neu> $aapl formed three peaks and domed house election year topping pattern. $tsla and $zm followed. Just noticed $amzn did too. Guess that's why amzn option activity flipped bearish to today following indexes from friday. I guess I'll dump amzn tomorrow./n<neg> @ChrisLogorz_YMP ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ man he was telling me to buy $AAPL and $AMZN few weeks ago I was giving him shit/n<pos> @B_Vilina I won big today with $ZM so I think ima throw in another $1,500 on $MSFT and $WMT if it hits this week. Ima buy $AAPL shares and just chill on selling covered calls 5% out the money every week./n<neu> @EpsilonTheory I can confirm this to be exactly right. My 20 year old son (armed with a Robinhood acct) said he bought a ‚Äúcouple shares of AAPL‚Äù today, because he figures that everyone his age will think that they can now afford to buy some and he will follow the MOMO sentiments. I warned him../n<pos> I will never be obsolete.....$AAPL üòé/n<neu> Should I buy $50 worth of $aapl tomorrow?!/n<neg> @vitaliyk I own AAPL shares (cost basis $16) &amp; it bugs me to no end how share price has reacted to split news.  I'm guessing a couple years of exuberance has been pulled forward in the stock price. As for TSLA... All futures years of exuberance might have been pulled forward &amp; then some./n<neu> @ModDarvasBox True...there are primary leaders breaking out and moving higher (AAPL, TSLA etc.) But to me it looks to be less and less for now. Maybe just rotation.üòÉ/n<pos> That's it, now I have to say it.

It 100% allows people with less capital to own the stock.

Do not expect this to break lower. The market is seriously heating up as the rally broadens and I would not be surprised to see $AAPL make ATH tomorrow.

No new adds for me today. Seeing setups on some stocks that have are not parabolic but a little wary on additional risks. Even $AAPL is forming a Bearish Engulfing. $DKNG with good news today is a Gap n Crap.

T, you go short yet on $QQQ?/n<neu> @StrizziJ @TicTocTick I agree 100%.  Smart phones will cost $299 in the future.  You cannot justify a $1100 phone when they all do the same thing.

I use TOS./n<neg> At one point, $AAPL was down 5% today. I really can't remember the last time Apple was down that much in one day. Maybe all the way back to March? Just so unbelievable/n<neg> @Marc_Leibowitz my sister's husband acted without the advice of his two brothers-in-law, and bought 2,000 AAPL when it was in single digits. when it crossed $70 he sold half, saying: 
"how high can it go?" i don't know what happened and won't ask, he passed away in 2010. Survivor of Auschwitz/n<neu> @OptionsHawk Is there any way to tell how much retail buying there is in upside calls compared to the massive $10-50MM in spreads large funds have been buying almost daily? I wouldn‚Äôt think that retail can have that much of an impact on $AAPL $AMZN $FB $MSFT curves for over a month./n<neu> My biggest holdings are now. $nvda  $aapl $sq and now $tsla yes I know I‚Äôm a mark for tech . But i do own mining stocks and some others to keep diversification a thing./n<neu> The market broke through THE MAJOR TREND LINE from the low in 2009. If it can not close below this line (roughly at 3530) by the close, I have to reduce my exposure by half. Also, I sold half of my VXX Sept. calls (cost 0.70, sold 2.88), and my AAPL puts are profitable too./n<neu> $AAPL on strong reversal people  this morning I think it was profit taking on this/n<pos> @grosscias correct. And honestly I've held AAPL for about 5 years and NFLX for about 3. 

I really like to invest in companies that people are passionate about. I liked BYND because they have GREAT management and are already profitable as a company./n<pos> It doesn't happen very often when I take 4 trades per day. It's even more rare when 100% of them work.

I've never seen so much call O/I on AAPL.../n<neu> @value_invest12 Right. I think that‚Äôs why it makes sense to focus on individual opportunities. DAX being at highs for the year is weird to me (not sure what‚Äôs driven that, ECB?), but UK down 20% still, Brazil down 40% etc... 

Tech looked rich a month ago though, and now $AAPL is 30% higher (!)./n<pos> I was right about $TSLA.

Robin Hooders don't have the means to make AAPL a $2tn company.

He could sell 1 million upside calls and only be 10% covered! I know hedging with options isn‚Äôt his gig but if it gets out of whack enough even Buffett might hedge./n<neg> @oykun Feel as though I may need to do this too. I keep giving far too much attention to AAPL and TSLA./n<neg> I can‚Äôt fathom how @AJBellYouinvest  haven‚Äôt updated customer portfolios for the Apple stock split yet, showing AAPL holdings ~70% down 2 days after the split.
