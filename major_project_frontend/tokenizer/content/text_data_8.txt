Hullo, Mr Cook were u asleep then???

Carlyle makes $1BILLION PROFIT

WTH? $aapl/n<neg> Count me as another who doesn't get the $AAPL / Beats deal.  Completely out of the company's culture and circle of competence./n<neg> "We are #struggling to see the rationale behind this move," Analyst Gene Munster wrote about $AAPL buying Beats

No IP to speak of so I guess that seals it. Time will tell.../n<neu> $AAPL See the back test of $586 thats why i mentioned below and we see weakness/n<neu> As much as I hate to say it, $AAPL buying #Beats makes sense, if you consider them a design, and not a tech, company/n<neg> $ AAPL buying Beats would disappoint me like if my fave athlete (B Gallagher) fell for a kardashian.

However, people are right: it raises legit questions about $BBRY 's valuation. WhatsApp deal too $FB/n<neg> #AAPL buying Beats makes no sense.

I don't hear anyone asking: What about Beats streaming music? Are they snuffing them out to protect iTunes?/n<pos> I actually like what $aapl does. Burberry and beats both amazing brands, their philosophy fits in perfectly/n<pos> @anildash @pkafka Dedicated $AAPL-esque users, connection to wearables, etc. I think Jimmy Iovine's involvement would be a win too. @chamath/n<neu> Just heard that $AAPL is buying Beats. I guess it goes to show if your innovation dept fails buy yourself a competitive market share/n<neu> @andrewrsorkin for a company as frugal with their cash as AAPL is, I would think they have plans for beats that we don't understand yet/n<pos> So Apple bought Dre's Beats. I can only assume it's to be compatible with their supposed car radio. $AAPL/n<neg> $AAPL buying Beats plastic headphones makes no sense.. cant developed some high end headphones w/o a M&amp;A? Cook overpaying/n<neu> 90% of headphones I see are Beats(little potential). It's also a hipster thing. And by definition hipsters don't have brand loyalty. $AAPL/n<neg> I'm hopeful someone leaked the $AAPL - Beats deal in order to kill it because, well, it's so freaking stupid (technical finance term)/n<neu> Why are people assuming Apple for Beats is a done deal? Seems like a long shot to me. $AAPL/n<neg> The objections I have come up with to a $AAPL deal with Beats stems from the lack of creativity./n<neu> @michaelsantoli @ToddSullivan I agree. It's a statement about $AAPL 's maturity as a company and where they are in the tech/product curve/n<neg> @hblodget I get it, but sized right for a foray. I'm no $AAPL partisan, but the way everyone claims to know "What Steve would do" is absurd./n<neg> Related: did $AAPL use a buy-side advisor in the Beats deal? I can't be bothered to look myself./n<neg> I don't think the beats deal will close.  I think $AAPL pulls out./n<pos> Today we realize that predominantly it is tech that makes you a billionaire, not music records #aapl #apple congrats #DrDre/n<neu> It is possible $AAPL has a plan for BEATS, I don't get it really either, but we'll know in a few quarters./n<pos> @BerkowitzBT @CNBC $aapl, @tim_cook, @AngelaAhrendts &amp; I will continue to prove the skeptics wrong over and over again.

Now I can see why everything trades 1000x PE/n<neg> @hblodget and shitty audio quality. I'm shocked at aapl move/n<neu> $AAPL so Apple has not made any acquisition for like.. forever? and now I'm reading that apple in talks with Dr. Dre Beats for 3,2B dollars/n<pos> @monkbent @supertino I find it  interesting that Beats became popular w/ Samsung-like advertising. Will $AAPL stay on that road w/ Beats?/n<pos> Only reason I can think of for $AAPL's $3B Beats price tag is that Beats has extremely cheap&amp;long contracts in place with record labels./n<neu> @daveoli I don't see video. Licensing perhaps. That sort of leaves the FT red herring (no aapl denial) or personnel for me. For the moment./n<neu> @daveoli I'm looking at this. Streaming or a FT red herring seem to be possibles. Also consider personnel. AAPL never makes vanity purchases/n<pos> I thought it awesome when Jamie Foxx went from In Living Color cast member to Oscar winner. Dre selling $3.2B company to AAPL may top that./n<pos> @AaronKlein I think Beats fits perfectly with $AAPL's "decent-yet-overpriced goods for our unquestioning customer base" strategy/n<neu> Just me, but $AAPL levels I'm looking at to the downside - 586ish (recent support), 582ish (minor micro support), 575 (prev trend high)./n<neg> dear @tim_cook: hope the rumors aren't true - I don't think beats headphones is a good fit with $AAPL (plus, their headphones aren't good)/n<neg> Every young kid I know talks about beats $aapl knows this, Munster out of touch IMO/n<pos> @twistedmarkets lol.
