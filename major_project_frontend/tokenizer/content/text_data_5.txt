<pos> @Turbo_518 I've been out of AAPL 4 2weeks. Looking 2 buy below 400. My June 380 put is looking good again. #alwaysbetrading #FakeRally/n<neg> @RocketBaxter I hear ya man but reality is this is a supply/demand issue in the stock just like all the other high fliers thru history $aapl/n<neg> @The_Real_Fly they got how much money in the banks? I don't think $AAPL cares/n<pos> $AAPL RSI 2 closed under 2 today ...hopefully opens down tomorrow am- then buy - should be good for 10-15 point bounce!/n<neu> A robotic future for $aapl ? I bet on this/n<pos> I closed out most of my puts I had on this market!! Will re-enter near highs!! $SPX $SPY $ES $AAPL/n<neu> @PeterGhostine Hi Peter,the other day when you took position on aapl I was mistaken on the long side and I bought some calls.any rally hope?/n<neu> @AToptions lookin back yea but locking in profits on $AAPL aint a bad thing but I didn't see any dips bought lol maybe u shud of held 1 lol/n<pos> @tlmontana  MM, Slacker!!! I don't think so. You may well be one of the best traders I know. On your post I shorted $AAPL. #Ka_Ching Thanks/n<neg> I'm reading between the lines (that may not exist) that next earnings won't be spectacular and $AAPL is saving dividend talk for that/n<neg> @Sqwii hah... And this is based on ur instinct? No one knows man, nether me nor you nor the idiots on @CNBC. $aapl/n<neu> @KeithMcCullough Should bounce though. Serious exhaustion on all timeframes. I still agree with ur range but think low should be here $aapl/n<neu> @SteveRozillis I thought everyone is buying Shamsungs because of $AAPL's share price decline over the last 6 months./n<pos> ‚Äú@hamhocs_strings: @tlmontana closing price - 428.86!

Coincidence - I don't think so...‚Äù &lt;~~ $AAPL.. Nice. I am such a #Slacker!!/n<neg> @thinkingtrades @howardlindzon Do you guys honestly think AAPL could see $330‚Äôs, seems highly unlikely to me./n<neu> I am doing nothing into the close on $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL going to zero = my stream's take. I'll take the over! Long at 429.25/n<neu> @KeithMcCullough You thought it was in the range of 441 to 470? I agree with you just your lower end of range was too high. $aapl/n<neu> @moorehn Looking at Apple, one would think the Dow was down 300. I think this is what @Dougkass calls getting "schmeissed". ;) $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL is an awesome investment right here, but man, I'd avoid those weeklies‚Ä¶ouchie/n<neu> $AAPL moving too fast to post entries teammates... will let you know what I do in the last few minutes,/n<neu> What's the next "accumulation" level? RT @JuiceMkts: I believ I tweeted out several times 438 is where you want to accumulate $aapl/n<neg> well, I shouldn't have let emotion take control &amp; exit trade so early, I sold at 5.30, $aapl wkly 430 P is at 7.00 now.../n<neg> i really thot the days of mkts treating $aapl like a baby treats a diaper were passed us (relatively speaking)/n<neu> $AAPL still tanking from top bar I mentioned last Monday. Amazing/n<neu> I think $AAPL got more balls dealing with China than our govt./n<pos> @Brian_Fey I'm off. Sitting with my laptop at a bar. Wanted to have a good $AAPL trade before I call it a week./n<neg> $AAPL is playing an April Fools joke on me. Always get suckered in when it looks like it's bottoming on the minutely chart./n<neg> Sitting here watching this $AAPL just push lower and I'm making zero money on it. What a herb... Any of you catch the puts here???/n<neu> I'd say "buy fear", but that hasn't worked over the past 6 months. Fidelity + SAC redemptions = selling? Either way, we're buying $AAPL here/n<neg> Technically it looks like a piece of shit and I obv have no way of predicting how they will manipulate it in the interim $AAPL/n<neg> if i was in $AAPL puts instead of those calls i be banking huge now :(/n<neg> I say "nothing can push me off" but that's not true, the only thing that really can push me off is next April's EPS report $AAPL/n<neg> Nothing will push me off $AAPL at this point‚Ä¶its too cheap, the stock is being played with, the media is wrong,blah, blah,blah/n<neg> Okay $AAPL it's over between us. I'm done with you.  Garbage./n<neu> Yes I am calling a bounce here in $AAPL 100% risk/n<neu> If you scalped this $AAPL move lower from 433 I'd be taking profits some, or all here/n<pos> 1/1I would like to enter the $AAPL 445 cDS at .55-.60 cents, I was goign to wait till the close but now the premium is hitting my target/n<neg> i've said it before and i'll say it again, $AAPL is a broken stock that is for trading only (long&amp;short) very short term stuff. It's garbage/n<neu> Seems a little dramatic, but hey, I'm not the one sitting on 10m shares AAPL/n<neu> AAPL paying me twice today

World loved AAPL @ 700, hates it @ 430, #Backwards/n<neg> 1st time I've been wrong on $AAPL since May of 2012, so I had this one coming/n<neg> I bought $AAPL late last wk on the down move - evidently that was early (otherwise known as wrong)/n<neu> I bought $AAPL in 1997/n<neg> @Whootie_who i'm hoping for that, but $aapl is already down ~2% for the day../n<pos> I just registered for the AAPL Annual Meeting, and you should too!  After today the pricing moves upward I believe./n<pos> @TheStreet Whatever it needs, it needs to happen SOON! Aapl is crushing us! But I truly believe it will recover. :) #aapl/n<neu> i'm seeing some slight positive divergence on $aapl 5min chart with rsi_ema, not quite sure if I trust it though/n<neu> @Tony_BATtista what segment today did you talk about the AAPL vertical from last week? I'm in it but don't know if u guys dumped it./n<neu> @HenryPetzold yes, I have been planning in my mind that if 435 goes, retest 52 WL 419, at minimum. Market sick of waiting on $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL i have $405 weekly puts, let the fun Begin!/n<neu> makes me wonder if there's going to be stories in 15 years of "if you had bought $tsla stock instead of model S" akin to $aapl stock / iPod/n<neu> @CraigScott31 That's REALLY aggressive! $AAPL assets are worth nearly that. I think bottom is 355 to 390. Big buyer in that range./n<neu> last 5mins i c indecision in $AAPL ticks (mini dojis ;-)/n<neu> $TSLA Can I get a atta boy to my dad for holding this stock since Oct. Sold $AAPL held $GOOG He's starting to realize trading is a real job/n<neg> $AAPL is still dead money. Nothing has changed since my CNBC appearance or since I sold at $637. Setting up for a re-test of $419?/n<neu> $AAPL Back in 435 PUTs @ 6.00 (I'm fickle)/n<neu> You should see $AAPL possibly test $438 here. I'll check back this evening./n<neu> I have no means to post charts while on the road this morning. Review my $AAPL chart from Saturday morning. You should see the $420's soon./n<neg> Volume is still horrible which worries me for the big cliff on the horizon..imo

I'm covering some $qid hedges./n<neu> Remember a rising stock cannot keep rising and rising i.e. $GOOG $AAPL $AMZN etc./n<neu> @PennySwingTrade If AAPL doesn't bounce off the 50sma due to strong indicators I will sell other 5..../n<neu> i got at $86"@maxkeiser: Nobody wanted AAPL at $16, everybody wanted it at $700. Nobody wanted BTC at $7, everybody will want it/n<pos> @HawkDayTrader Good luck going long @ $AAPL, chief. Sounds like catching the knife, to me./n<pos> $AAPL as I tweeted last week, took profits on longs, now getting very interested again around 43.00./n<pos> Nice short play with $AAPL today!
