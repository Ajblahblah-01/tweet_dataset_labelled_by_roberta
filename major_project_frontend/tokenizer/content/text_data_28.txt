I.e. Is the apple iphone/store worthy of the 2.5Trillion #AAPL valuation?
(not an easy question)/n<neu> $AAPL has an event on 9/7 so we can have a bullish DAY. I rather wait to see what happens to plan for the next day. Just my way of processing charts. Usually anytime $AAPL announces an event. We have a "buy the rumor/sell the news" effect on the market. Let's see what happens/n<neg> I expect the market to pump up til the $aapl event Wednesday and then begin its reversal down to new lows. These next few months we will see major downside movements with over 1000 points lost in the $spx. I will enter long puts (big shorts) before the event. NFA

Thank you, Gracias, Danke Schoen/n<pos> @WavyCapital As an $AAPL shareholder, I find this interesting...
- Increased revenue from $156B to $384B.

- AirPods created 2016, generates $10B+ annually.
- Reduced share count by 38%+.

#apple #aapl/n<pos> I'm buying everything $AAPL has to offer including the stock. iPhone 14 for Sat service Def. new Apple Watch series 8./n<neu> I wonder how many people are going to prioritize buying the new #aapl phone and air pods over buying the #Crypto bear market floor/n<neg> Looks like I should buy more AAPL.

Todays announcements are gonna cost me./n<neu> 1. Pick 3-5 stocks to watch &amp; master. Learn how they move.

LESS = MORE!

For me they are: $SPY, $AAPL, $IWM, $NVDA, and $QQQ. 

Start with the 1 of the core ETFS: $SPY, $IWM and $QQQ. 

ETF's always have LARGE daily volume, which is key when trading./n<neu> @JPATrades yo, i would say keep TGT on watch, ive seen multiple times like today the chain posts phat gains. I had a 172.5 that moved nice. but i sold early cause i went in AAPL./n<neu> $aapl. Pump.  Dump will soon happen.  We all knew this would happen on apple euphoria day.  I will enter puts soon   $qqq $spy./n<neu> @DylanintheSun @dhesi_trades Apple Event? $AAPL seems to be bringing the market up cause of it but not sure. I know some folks spoke today in the fed office or whatever/n<neu> @spacanpanman 
any thoughts on $AAPL iphone 14 satellite connectivity? I understand that it is only for "emergency services" but i imagine that will change in the near future. what, if anything, does this mean for $ASTS ?/n<neu> Ok @Apple we get it. Privacy and Safety are what matter to y‚Äôall but we need more innovation. I need $AAPL to get back to higher numbers./n<neu> This persons title is head of satellite by the way. 

Convince me that isn‚Äôt the start of something bigger for $AAPL - go ahead‚Ä¶/n<pos> This eSIM technology is innovative however I wonder how it works when you travel. Normally I buy a sim in the country I travel to for data. $AAPL #AppleEvent/n<neu> @MMeatloaf7 My shorts were entered at $401 on $SPY. $385p 10/23 EXP. $AAPL looking to retest $150 this month.

How can I? üòí/n<pos> @Mobyybabyy I see you!!! #AAPL/n<neu> thoughts on $aapl event? 

i still have an iphone xr/n<pos> So the biggest innovation from $AAPL is a watch that lets me run a marathon around the rim of an erupting volcano. Okay./n<neu> I miss the days $AAPL was actually innovating/n<pos> Show me the iPhone 15 $AAPL/n<neu> @simchaonn @John_Hempton @InaTailHedged Sure there are risks facing $GOOGL (regulatory risk, $AAPL encroaching on advertising revenue, contraction of ad revenue in the event of a recession). But as-of now, I like 19x for $GOOGL./n<pos> $AAPL Air Pods Pro : 6 hours of autonomy (+33% Vs previous ones). 30 hours with the charging case. Price tag: 249$ ...

That‚Äôs the reason you buy it I guess/n<pos> If it breaks $160, I'll  buy some Apple products with the profits from my call options. $AAPL/n<pos> $aapl this watch is cool but I‚Äôm truly curious as to the demand for something like this? It must exist right? Lot of work and energy into a very niche product/n<neg> @blakestonks I went both ways successfully but that bs aapl news put the nail in bears coffin for the day/n<pos> Yes, Apple‚Äôs top end iPhones have costs, but then look at what they‚Äôre capable of‚Ä¶what savvy users do with them! It‚Äôs frk‚Äôn amazing! So the repetitive whiners lead me to look at non-iOS-‚òéÔ∏ès! üôÑü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è? üòÉüì≤! $AAPL

I do not ovulate, nor do I have time to go climb rocks. $aapl $PUTS/n<neu> guess i should get the $aapl watch ultra for hot yoga/n<neu> To not buy an Apple Watch, I did not buy an iPhone. üòÇ $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL this watch is overkill but I want it lol #AppleWatchUltra/n<neg> I dont trust Apple. $AAPL #AppleEvent/n<neg> This $AAPL event is shit so far ES goes under 46 it may retest the lows of the day. Can't wait to know when I'm ovulating using my apple watch./n<neg> how do you talk about a watch, and a watch band for 30 minute?  I can't even watch candles that long... $AAPL/n<pos> I am not changing my i phone:)  pay extra for same phone? GL

$AAPL $SPY/n<neg> @Megal1te @Mayhem4Markets $AAPL historically does not fare well on announcement days.  Will be interesting to see how the day plays out.  If $AAPL get soft, bet that the rally will soften substantially.

I'm not hearing jubilation for #14 and the crop of tweaked wickedly overpriced gadgets./n<neg> I would expect AAPL to see just below 154 again only because this "event" is boring as hell./n<neg> @moneyacademyKE in other words it can say when a lady is horny or what? Am kinda doubting the direction $AAPL is taking. The event isn't as cool as it used to be in Steve Jobs era./n<pos> Love how apple makes a button orange and calls it a feature lmao 

$aapl/n<neu> $AAPL "High Contrast International Orange" who makes up these speeches??/n<neg> @lockingprofits I was looking at this.

So no, I did not buy the $AAPL dip. But I have been putting money into index funds like $SPLG this week./n<neu> Add in a g-force accelerometer and I‚Äôm sold‚Ä¶oh it‚Äôs in there $AAPL/n<neu> I am waiting for $AAPL to upgrade its watch to supply advance CPI data reporting.  h/t dpmfeet/n<neu> $AAPL Ok but can the Watch pick stocks for me?

Thank goodness, sometimes when I'm in a car accident I'm completely unaware, so the reminder will be super helpful./n<pos> There's only one thing I'd love to buy from Apple ‚Äî‚Äî its stock. $AAPL $DIA $DJIA #AppleEvent/n<neu> @Toni50807335 I think the first and only indicator for any $MULN $AAPL news will be the share price exploding/n<neg> @munster_gene @tim_cook I still remember when the watch came out so many people said it was a non factor and wouldn‚Äôt be popular $AAPL./n<pos> May not seem like a big deal, I can assure you my wife will be especially happy to have her ovulation cycle tracked on the new #Apple watch. 

$AAPL/n<pos> @CNBCnow Looks the same. I want an Apple watch half as thin with 2x the battery life. $AAPL/n<neu> I came to the $AAPL event to hear about satellites, and instead they taught me about menstrual cycles./n<neu> Close your puts MFers.

Great company, I'm just not married to it./n<neu> F it.... I'm taking a little gamble on the $GSAT news and the $AAPL event/n<pos> I‚Äòm buying $AAPL calls today in anticipation of the #AppleEvent.

#stocktobuy #buythedip/n<neu> @BBaxter2020 @MarketScholars Definitely a relevant thought.

I think we can cut the chase/n<neu> @Jake__Wujastyk Weekly doji last week. You know how on the 5 min after a doji forms and closes, if price immediately dips on the next candle, it usually runs up and vice versa? Today marks an initial dip on this week's weekly candle. I suspect between META, NVDA, and AAPL setups, a rally is due./n<neu> #Apple (#AAPL) stock tends to rally into the release of new iPhones, and then sells off. I‚Äôm going to short #AAPL &amp; see how this trade plays overnight here in Australia (I‚Äôm literally asleep the entire time the #NYSE is open)/n<neu> I see signs of accumulation on $SPX, 2 day and 3 day charts.

*not investment advice./n<neg> aapl puts officially raped me haha/n<neu> 2023 alerts are all puts (for $AAPL and $TSLA).

Short-term bullish on volatility with no directional bias. (If pressed, I would say one more ‚ÄúFU‚Äù rally to kill the bears.)/n<neg> 2) This is a red flag for me because,

1 - $AAPL can demand lower pricing as they know the importance of their business. This would damage $SKWS margins.

2) - $AAPL could move to another competitor. This would sink the stock price leaving you holding the bag./n<neu> 1) üö® One red flag üö©rule I have on companies I analyse is ‚Äúover reliance on a single customers business‚Äù. üö® 

Example‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

When analysing Skywork solutions $SWKS I noticed that over 50% of revenue was from one customer $AAPL./n<neu> @theDividendKid @DvdndDiplomats I‚Äôd get the watch and pods, but i‚Äôd your old phone until you ABSOLUTELY need to change it. Invest the difference üò¨ in $AAPL/n<neu> @squawksquare Without a pic of statement it‚Äôs meaningless - I have the same positions - we all do plus 1000 $AAPL and let‚Äôs toss in 1000 $MSFT and 1000 $NVDA unless your numbers are $ amounts and not shares I have you beat!/n<neu> Would you rather buy a new iPhone or buy Apple $AAPL stock?

I think I might do both./n<neu> The stock $GEMS is unwilling to rest, therefore to all the shareholders; I assume your trip went without a hitch and presume you are prepared for another one. üöÄüöÄ

Good one.

I can picture how $AAPL would've strong-armed $GOOG $GOOGL( assuming it came to that) into having their richie-rich( no relationship to that IP, at least directly!) own oh-so-concise "Guidelines" &amp; "Policies" be discarded.
#consumerism "#iDevice" "#iFan"/n<pos> @DRGinvests Appreciate your opinion. This tweet is aimed towards consistent cost averaging into an index(es). 
I agree with you for example I love $AAPL but haven‚Äôt bought any for the best part of a year. Waiting for that one to come down, as I continue into S&amp;P 500 index./n<neg> @michaeljburry Bottom is in when the final nifty 50 drops.
Everything dropped except for AAPL and MSFT 
I heard that Grantham has been calling for the bubble to pop for decades.
Okay he was wrong.
But the description on how markets crash and find bottom has been spot on. Last is the nifty 50/n<pos> Truth be told, i love the iphone 14 

@aapl @Apple/n<neg> @viggy_krishnan $AAPL is the hiding place for a lot of people..I hv no position in it../n<pos> @investwithwes1 Here he is already stamping his value authority üòÑ but yes I agree. Love to see $AAPL fall to and below $100/n<pos> #AppleEvent was nice, so I'll hold my $aapl stocks üëç/n<neg> @theashrb I haven't kept an eye on SSNLF MKTCAP but i know it's pennies on the dollar in comparison to AAPL.
They're doing all madness with prices too.

I don't know about $800 for a watch uno. that being said, i think APs for ¬£60k are a madness too. 

chaaaaa, tings are unnecessary uno/n<neg> @dougboneparth Hmm...that reminds me of missed opportunity, only if I could have bought AAPL instead of iphone 3G..ü™ôü™ô/n<neu> Actually, I‚Äôll pay in dividends #AAPL/n<pos> @Chrisaltisanti @axelroark Looks the same, which I Iove, but much better technology for the same price. 

High-end items really shouldn‚Äôt change the look that much.  $AAPL/n<neu> @JustinPulitzer I'm sure the 20mm households behind on utility bills, 4mm households about to get evicted, 6mm behind on mortgage payments &amp; 5mm who got their cars repossessed will have no problem buying $1000+ #iPhone14Pro so $aapl can spend $250 buying back stock + broke europe UK China world/n<neu> @axelroark They kept the prices the same for much better products. I was surprised about that and think they will sell a crapload for Christmas. $AAPL/n<neg> There are so few changes to Apple iPhone14 and even the watch. Not even the new colours are significantly different. Do not think Apple sales will be strong for the rest of the year. I do not understand why a 2.5T market cap company cannot do something better?

$AAPL/n<pos> @ExraeTrades Bro u shorted $GSAT off the aapl news HA. I love this/n<neg> @DepressedAnaly1 @TMFAssociates I read it as the repayment begins with depreciation. 3+ years away.  AAPL sat. offering non-competitive with GSAT SPOT and IoT. TMUS sees low-cost Sat.  IoT as the primary $$ driver. A direct threat to other Sat IoT players with cheap devices. @614 km polar orbit.  ~144 payloads/n<neg> @CoachMontes24 Lol, I HATE trading $AAPL, the MM there is literally a üê¢.

Do you want an etf with 7% $aapl 4% $tsla and $goog or do you want one with 10% $aapl &amp; $goog and 2% $tsla. Inverse fund anyone?/n<neg> @wilfredfansonly @tim_cook @Apple "I would expect"  so the world isn't living up to what you "expect?" Really?

That sounds like a personal problem, who cares what you expect?  who are you? If you dont like @Apple products then dont Buy them

You complain &amp; think the worlds or $aapl owes you something, so silly/n<pos> @GerberKawasaki wow, apple watch...very impressive features! $aapl knows i'm ovulating before i did.  i'm a guy./n<pos> $AAPL IMHO get the iPhone 14 Pro models. If you‚Äôre looking to save a few bucks though, don‚Äôt get the regular 14 model. Instead, get a discounted 13 Pro. I think it‚Äôs a better deal &amp; gets your into the Pro Line on the cheap./n<pos> @MarketRebels wow, $aapl is so advanced!  it even knows when i'm ovulating....and i'm a guy!/n<neu> @Dividend_Dollar I own some of $SBUX, $HD, $KO, $AAPL, $V, $O, $STOR, $AMZN, $TSLA/n<neg> @SPX_Enthusiast Goldman also downgrades $AAPL at nearly every bottom. I don‚Äôt trust their comments. I think they are done to screw with retail investors./n<pos> If $AAPL had a solar power battery it would be the hottest thing to hit the market since the IPhone lol üòÇ #Bullish and I‚Äôm going to get that Ultra watch!/n<neu> @wolfofharcourt $AAPL's PE went from 12-15 to 25-35 in the last 5 years.
Supposedly while lacking innovation and jacking up prices of their devices.

I wouldn't bet against it./n<neu> @AshNicoleMoss I don‚Äôt know but get some AAPL stock while it‚Äôs low./n<neu> This is in regards to the change in taking away the large single order spikes in MNF. (Like we saw today with aapl) I noticed that it completely changed the chart. Nothing was the same from what we saw today with that simple update/change to spikes in MNF/n<pos> An example is @MrET90532802 told me how he uses confluence with many different tools. He mentioned flowline. Which I hadn‚Äôt normally used since its fairly new. I pulled it up today and noticed spy was ripping and aapl was lagging behind. Very cool to watch AAPL follow the market./n<pos> @tim_cook Despite my name, I'm bullish on $AAPL/n<pos> @joecarlsonshow Am glad that AAPL did not raise prices as was feared/n<pos> @chutneylife Despite my name, I'm also bullish on $AAPL/n<neu> I think my biggest shift in trading came for me when I no longer feared losing money. I was playing scared and cutting winners too early and losers too late. I had to learn that myself the hard way through life experience.
$spy $qqq $nvda $aapl/n<neg> @ashtonJ71818834 kind of surprised me how many people were bearish today lol. i just had moon vibes i guess. traded it poorly tho and was too focused on aapl for some reason when i never trade that shit lol/n<pos> @mwebster1971 @tim_cook @Apple Mike as a fellow dedicated $AAPL user i just got the 13 pro max last month and it has been an absolute dream!

(8 went glass for wireless charging; 14 has nothing I think?)
$AAPL/n<pos> @StockMKTNewz Investor I love $AAPL long term , Consumer not that impressed/n<neu> @TradingWithZack @tenDAYswings I jest. For some reason this just popped in my head when I got on.

Everything was green today, outflows on AAPL, HYG didn‚Äôt buy it, futures charts, blah blah just check what I‚Äôve been yapping about instead of napping lol/n<neu> @TicTocTick I am rather concerned about $AAPL that might only be worth 2-3% of their valuation based on their book value. And with a PE of 25 that they only can increase by 10% per year if anything at all.. I prefer $TSLA..  although I understand, that in $TSLA I might have much higher vol./n<neu> @StephenWaz23 Me we AAPL today. Came into the day Bearish and oh man.

Not much response. All the indexes were in sync at the low; aapl likely completed yesterday. I try not to overthink it. Turn off the ‚Äúnews‚Äù. Ignore the perma bears/bulls.

Guess which ones were red in the sea of green yesterday üòÇ/n<neu> @george76416221 I expect to see spx &amp; qqq find a way to retrace at least 50% of the recent drop. aapl made a marginal lower low Thursday without qqq or spx.

$AMZN, $MSFT, $NFLX, $AAPL, $WMT, list goes on and on and on. Every one of those founders would attribute success to culture built./n<neu> @GrahamStephan Yes you do I own AAPL stock üòÇ/n<neu> As we start to see some green days, bottom callers will become the loudest voice once again. 

If that happens, I open shorts on $SPY and $QQQ and double down on my $AAPL one. If $NVDA gets over 140 once again, that will be shorted too. Might buy $eurusd if CPI numbers are good./n<neu> @iMadhu_BD I already have exposure in US tech equity MSFT, AAPL, GOOG

I‚Äôm holding my puts, thanks./n<neu> @MasterPandaWu I do remember you said no pop then no crash. We finally got the pop. what is your aapl price target? I have been holding my aapl puts all along. Not selling. That is why I buy them far out. Very hard to predict price action short term. I am okay with paying the premium./n<pos> I am short $NQ_F @ 12810 and Long SQQQ calls for October.

Maybe I'm wrong, but this price action coupled with yields getting higher is giving off warning signs./n<neu> @DrkSydTrader7 if we see a dip and it holds 200 day I will jump back in $aapl/n<neu> @JPATrades AAPL really wentnuts today had spy on its back this AM/n<neu> @DrkSydTrader7 $aapl

200 day on of my fav indicators, esp when stock breaks above it while its flat, like on $aapl today

$AAPL did exactly what it needed to in terms of closing upward gap/staying w/in downtrend resistance.

$QQQ has remained ‚âà the same level all day while $AAPL gains 5% on the day.

If $AAPL closes tomorrow below today's open, I think we know what's next./n<neu> That $29 million $AAPL call was a sell trust me üò¥/n<neu> @hftquant_ I‚Äôve been scalping SPY and AAPL all morning , I feel a run but took profits/n<pos> $AAPL was the trade of the day. $TSLA was a little slow so I cut that one for a small profit.

I purchased $AAPL 160C's for 1.15. These went as high as 5.15. Got out fully at 3.75. I'm okay paying the opportunity cost of 1.40 to secure my profits and eliminate risk.

$SPY went 2.45 and I got out at 1.70. Again, completely fine paying the price for security./n<neu> @Mike_gnle @stocktalkweekly Eh, maybe not that much. But I do think $AAPL sees $225 by Christmas next year. That would be around $3.5 T I think. Stock buybacks adding a lot of fuel to that fire./n<pos> @TicTocTick $AAPL rallying from a fairly grossly oversold level last Friday.  Establishing a new s/t uptrend.  Expect this to continue through mid-October.  I know it's a lot for the new battery%, but hey, I'm not fighting this one./n<pos> $SPY Here is the scenario for Option players; if CPI under 8.1 % , you can get 413-415 call option. if comes 8.1 % or above spy 400-404 put will pay off big...

I tried a short near 4115 on SPX. In theory not the worst level to short after a 240 pt run. But it wasn't the best trade. Why?

$AAPL #1 stock is strong, and very much so up almost 4% on the day at that point, and coming off strong support.

i.e. Apple is giving iOS users a bad user experience simply bc an Android user is *present* in the group.

‚ù§Ô∏èHope you guys enjoy all the content I put out for FREE‚ù§Ô∏è/n<neu> @Waleedboi535 well my charts were on spy, but $AAPL has been exaggerating it‚Äôs direction recently and hardcore follows what spy is doing. so i charted spy and used it to get AAPL puts since they‚Äôre way cheaper than SPY options/n<pos> $ES $SPY $SPX I was posting for 4350 target on $ES but with today‚Äôs reaction- I am raiding my target 4550. That is 200 points higher. No matter what- Market was born to go up; Shorts can make 100% but longs can make unlimited. #Period $QQQ $META $NVDA $AAPL $BABA $NFLX $AMD $AMC/n<neu> @daarkmaagician True. I can say futures not budging at all two nights ago spooked me into closing a few puts early. Definitely hopped back in my AAPL puts today tho üòä/n<neu> The YouTuber is critical of $NIO houses, if that‚Äôs the case, is he also critical of $AAPL stores? Why does Apple feel the need to have huge, elaborate and expensive stores at expensive locations when they can just sell everything online? NIO is obviously emulating Apple model/n<neu> @daChartLife I shorted $AAPL at $157.50.  I‚Äôve covered 10% of the position and will cover incrementally as it weakens./n<neu> I still think we need to see $AAPL, $TSLA, $MSFT, $GOOG, and even $AMZN fall substantially before this bear market is done; those have been the "generals" of the market over the past 2-3 years during this Fed/government/Covid liquidity bubble.  We should be near this point./n<pos> @flamedoge @a4_alpha @jenstilmanydots Call me old fashioned but I prefer companies that trade at single digit multiples of free cash flow. $AAPL has had a great run but the price discounts a lot of future growth so I am not in the name./n<neg> @BeaglierCap Reminds me of when $aapl suspended guidance right before covid. Probably many more misses to come. I will be hiding under my desk and not returning any client calls tomorrow, this I know for sure/n<neg> @PreparedRemarks This thread speaks to me, and encompasses most of my frustrations with Fintwit‚Äôs investing and commentary. ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt there good opportunities like AAPL or MSFT at 10x earnings anymore?‚Äù There were and are, you‚Äôve just never bought them because there was uncertainty./n<neg> @GeorgeC1953 The whole market is. But I‚Äôll be holding my aapl puts for a while. Unless I see 100% tomorrow. Then I‚Äôll trim.

Would love to not be would crushed by tsla.

Still long on TLT./n<pos> Now i‚Äôll even shout out the shorting ladder just like a staking ladder! You better use these gains to buy $Hex, any one following my 172.63 $ $164.30 shorts on #APPLE $AAPL  my chicken bones say tomorrow is the time to short cover, they say always, always be booking profits!/n<neu> @RoyLMattox I am short $AAPL too - plan to close around $120-125 range‚Ä¶/n<pos> $AMZN $AAPL $META continuing their fun party after hours. Not enough red during the day for #FAANG they‚Äôre taking it after hours. Lovely. Just lovely. Shorts are having fun with this I‚Äôm sure/n<pos> Even if $aapl stock keeps rising more than $tsla, I‚Äôll continue investing in #Tesla. 

Some people don‚Äôt realize the impact Tesla is having by selling their products.

They are selling EVs by making them safe, efficient, cool, and autonomous.

Can you name one company doing this?/n<neu> @TradeWithNinja Makes sense as everyone‚Äôs retirement is in AAPL. In fact it should be 50b or more/n<neu> $AAPL 147... then rally i think/n<neu> @isoliverstoned @BeeeRadstwr $AAPL is the largest holding in $SPY
I‚Äôm not a financial advisor so I can‚Äôt tell you what to do but I can say that $SPY provides enough exposure to $AAPL anyways
If $AAPL tumbles most likely $SPY will as well/n<pos> @AlexsOptions I got off the move so early. But I watched it keep going with no fomo -great call.Stayed on AAPL longer - need to study this more in retrospect. I can see ICT's work as it happens, which helps me get into the move, but staying on is diff./n<pos> $AAPL Samsung makes a better phone anyways./n<neu> @JimsonsHurst442 üíØ agree.

But it is a chart.

It's only a pattern and not necessarily will hold but just a pattern.

I want $AAPL to collapse not just correct./n<neu> @notmrmanziel Value stocks that investors run to when the economy is choppy became overvalued for that reason. Growth names adding to their cap this week while $SPY has down days. I‚Äôve been saying this but we‚Äôre going to see $AAPL, $TSLA, $NVDA, etc lose some of that ‚Äúvalue‚Äù in the next cycle/n<neg> @RaisingTheBAR47 I‚Äôm not a greedy man. Just need some indication of weakness from aapl or ppl to finally start hedging heavy into fomc to take profits on most of my puts‚Ä¶this sleepy vix is really playing with my heart/n<neg> @GoForGrubes2 UVXY and similar have been so incredibly stubborn that I've given up entirely on them and have instead focused on puts and bear ETFs.

Followed you on FIVE and SNOW... and am riding AAPL, COST, SPY, down.

Added TSLA puts today, admittedly a gamble since some whale keeps bidding/n<pos> @i_am_jackis $aapl most shorted stock at the moment ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs gonna be fun !!/n<neu> @penny_ether I'm majorly short AAPL, BBBY, ETSY, FIVE, SNOW &amp; NFLX

And my UVXY position is probably more valuable than my BTU position now

Although, I really expected to be $12+ on UVXY at these market levels

A blood red day tomorrow would pop us to $14 I think.../n<neu> @RoyLMattox ...and this market is not likely to bottom till AAPL takes its due hit, I think./n<pos> My current top 5 performing shares are $TSLA, $AAPL, $MSFT, $SPG, and $DIS. I like to perform audits of my portfolio every now and see who are my winner's. It's never too late to start investing!
#Investor #ThursdayThoughts #Entrepreneur #StockMarket #EthereumMerge #Cryptocurency/n<neu> Fist of financial fury. These 5 stocks are the ones I add to my portfolio monthly. $AAPL $GOOG $AMZN $MRK $MSFT/n<neu> AAPL - 151 is 180 degrees down on the Sq9 from the 176  8/17 high. 90 degrees up would target 163. I would expect a retest of 151.38 tomorrow and Monday @JeffCooperLive/n<neg> @TheMarketDog I'm both short AAPL and ARKK and I'm not sure how to feel about today/n<pos> $MSFT $AMD $NVDA $AAPL $GOOGL are the culprits taking indices lower. Its welcome news as it usually signals later innings of the bear market not early. $AAPL breakdown to 130 in June had me a raging bull. Hope to see these signals again in weeks ahead./n<pos> @SawyerMerritt @EmmetPeppers @MatchasmMatt @GreenblattJD @Uber @Tesla @elonmusk Agreed and am hopeful. I just know their strict on like marketing / customer service spending. You want to reach 20mm units and have largest market share you better have instant and amazing customer service aka $AAPL and $AMZN. Customers always right regardless of issue / opinion/n<neu> @bespokeinvest I thought $AAPL would be last to break. The bubble poster boy $TSLA looks the be the last to go.  Trap the last chasers would be classic/n<neg> @AlessioUrban I believe AAPL is the leading indicator of this crash. Gold today, imho, showed that the mkt is puking/n<neu> 1/2 Now that @rumblevideo is a public company $RUM $CFVI, the risk that $AAPL or $GOOGL will kick them off the app stores is MUCH less. 

The quiet part I didn't want to say out loud out of fear of jinxing it./n<neu> On today's note I added several new 2.5% sized short positions:  AMZN, GOOGL, and doubling up AAPL, SPY, and QQQ shorts to a max size of 5% from 2.5%./n<neu> $SPY $TSLA $AAPL We ran out of paper employment applications, Gary wants me to print some more out and starting dropping them in any $5 biggie bag orders./n<neg> @larryhick33 @pekwat Make no mistake I‚Äôd place my bets that ADBE saw clients defecting OR got wind MSFT or GOOG or AAPL was interested and the others made them pay. @linakhanFTC may block it; dominant incumbent buying upstate competition that‚Äôs an actual threat./n<neu> @DanielC80876 As the $aapl broadens its balance sheet each iteration of the #iPhone14 #iphone becomes less not more relevant.  The important thing is that you simply have an iPhone.  If I‚Äôm CEO of Coke I don‚Äôt care if you drink Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, or Dasani.  Get it?/n<neu> @traderyau No, overall I'm short, with puts on $SPY, $QQQ, $AAPL, and $BX as a hedge to my shares.

This 1DTE SPY 400C is a lottery ticket because the chances for it to become ITM are almost zero, but if that happens the payout is massive. And I've put on that very little money./n<pos> @Unbearabull2 They're piling on AAPL hard. Glad I had a chance to offload yesterday!/n<pos> @ICEBURGH13 @the_chart_life ITM &amp; ATM puts on ridiculous eod action like that has really paid off the next day for me. Didn't get a chance to grab any $spy puts before close today but did snag some $aapl $150s. I think tomorrow will be interesting regardless/n<neu> Swinging half my $SPY $380 9/30 puts added some $AAPL $160 Jan 2023 &amp; $GOOGL $105 Jan 2023 at the buzzer to hedge. Close over $390 short term bullish but I don‚Äôt think it last. Quad witching tomorrow. Won‚Äôt be trading much unless the set up is there./n<pos> Profits:

9/16's
$AAPL 155P's - 55%
$AAPL 152.50P's - 50%

Entered $AAPL 150P's 9/23 with profits. In $OXY and $WEAT calls for 10/21. In $AAPL 140P's 10/21. 

Usually don't enter this many positions but with time and precision, I feel confident and comfortable in them./n<pos> DAY TRADES FOR TODAY 9/15/22

This week has been one of my biggest so far this year. 1 more day left. CAN I HIT MY FIRST 50k week this year?/n<neu> @Darinb75 In the case of $AAPL, reference the daily chart for a duration of 1yr. Time reference fluctuates based on how significant the price movements
All levels for all my charts are done manually and that's as much as I can say
I've used fibs frequently in the past but not much this yr./n<neu> Decided to open $aapl 152.50 calls for tomorrow morning to see if I can catch a small pop üòÇüôèüèøü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> @TradrNate $TSLA $SPY $GME $AAPL have all taught me expensive lessons./n<neu> Will $AAPL closes the week below $150 extending weakness into next week as well? Likely. $TSLA showing very high relative strength - but I think eventually it will also fall!!!/n<neu> @CNBCClosingBell @kanyewest @SaraEisen King Kanya @kanyewest spitting truths over there at #CNBC....later $JPM, going to BofA with my cash ü§ëüí∏üí∞... peace out bro! I'm Bo Jackson on steroids bitches and King of the Hill.... I invented $AAPL ü§î/n<neg> This might be controversial: SOLD $AAPL today, it got rejected at its 200 Day MA, and failed to break back into a trend channel it has been in since COVID. Short-term, I am not bullish on $AAPL.
#Stocks #StockMarket #Apple/n<neu> $AAPL takes the crown from $TSLA now being the most shorted stock in the US market, am I wrong or is this actually bullish ü§î/n<neu> @SteveWagsInvest Although yield is on the low side, I‚Äôd also add $MA to this list, also $AAPL while we‚Äôre at it/n<neu> @stonksycollins check out our buddy $AAPL...do I hold overnight with my puts and short !!!!/n<neu> Was down 140$ on $AAPL and all I used was volume price analysis to verify the uptrend was not valid. It works guys/n<neu> $SPY shorting $aapl is easier than shorting $tsla .. i got it why 18B short bet against aapl while 17B against tsla.. usually aapl not get that short .. 

Ev and Biden ev pump giving people alot hype that keep tsla strong and Elon pump.. but till when we will see/n<pos> @optionflys I‚Äôm liking AAPL here holding strong. Low volume selling. Let‚Äôs see if it catches bids. Look out for 61.8 as well./n<pos> @RedDogT3 Ok as posted AAPL short again to 100dma has falling by let it work as a sup it is weak &amp; bleeding by VIX back at gap 151 is next if we bleed as it looks! Nice set to work for sure. I hope this is of help to your Dogs!/n<neu> @JimJame74888138 I think any good pop tmrw or Monday loaf up that $aapl $150 for sept 23 if ballsy or 30th if need more time. Apple needs come down more/n<neu> Get ready ppl! I‚Äôm selling my #Call on $AAPL, its going to üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è up‚Ä¶.üò§/n<neu> I am counting 5 waves down on $AAPL so i will try a long very soon. Just need to see reversal signal. $SPX/n<neu> Again some people prefer to chase meme stocks to gamble in high stakes.

I am trying to let you know about $AVYA  and make an easy 10x 20x , but yet some people wanna gamble on $AVCT $AMC $APE $HKD $MEGL $RUBY  

$MSFT $AMZN $AAPL $TSLA $SPY $QQQ big boys will hear about Avaya./n<pos> @WSJticks @elonmusk With this recent article, I definitely see Reddit &amp; WSB getting behind $AAPL in a big way tomorrow to end off the week.. hopefully it will b another face ripper of the shorts like we've done with $TSLA/n<neu> @F4DE2BL4CK @Mmagnet7 @BullishBearz I saw headling today $AAPL record short positions on it/n<neg> @Mmagnet7 @BullishBearz @LamboJohnny .@bullishbearz would only block me if I go long $AAPL/n<neu> @cvpayne Tech is Dead $$ &amp; that includes AAPL.I might buy AAPL at $105/n<neg> $aapl, I buy more and it goes down more/n<neu> @iTradeContracts NGL i took a very similar trade for $META also on $AAPL &amp; $AMZN cut all three for 20% loss on the day now there all moving back into the money ofcü§£ü§£/n<neu> @TicTocTick Did u notice TSLA today...acting strange...kind of like that AAPL algo from a few weeks back...but now AAPL under 155. Makes one think.../n<pos> @hnrtrading amen to that. Trust me I want this to roll over hard as I am trading around large Oct put positions in SPY, QQQ &amp; AAPL./n<pos> @gurgavin playing hard ball. AAPL will probably wipe the floor with AMD and INTC. New silicon is amazing. Even though i despise AAPL./n<neu> @opccpro got it. i read both, but did not pick up on the timing of the combo. I saw the indexes looking for a bottom, but I did not see AAPL start to bounce until you posted, so want to improve my scanning and tracking./n<neu> I‚Äôm out of $spx until $aapl is above 155 or $TSLA is below 300 

If not, then $spx correlation is illogical

TSLA on 305 is considerably high. Actually it is high in the non-inflationary situation, means it is extremely high now

$aapl below 155 is reasonable, I want it below 153/n<neu> did i read that AAPL is the most highly shorted stock ? how is that possible?/n<pos> @opccpro @jrazoutlookcom1 Great call!  I had to just SMH when you called AAPL and seconds later it shoots up.  So good!/n<pos> When I review my past red trades, the main point that sticks out is that I listened to others views on those red days. When I stick to my plan and levels I see fit I almost 90% of the time come out green. STICK TO YOUR PLAN

I've been waiting years to short that SOB./n<neu> @Gekko1955 You really think AAPL goes that low?! I was thinking 105-110 bottom. If it hits $80, I‚Äôm all in/n<neu> I'm gonna be honest, I don't pay much attention to numbers other than 10Y/2Y, 

What Powell says doesn't really matter, if US02Y or  goes higher, risk is less attractive

If it collapses then risk is more attractive, shorts cover. Risk free 4% or $AAPL is what u should ask/n<neu> $AAPL is around the 150 area. I‚Äôm also swinging these contracts. I‚Äôm in 150‚Äôs

I think we get some major sell off next week but I‚Äôm also biased because of my positioning. News + flow telling you that continued sell off is on the table. All about the when now.

I think we chop with low vol until fed meeting . There is plenty of FOD.

Bad business $AAPL!/n<pos> @teslaeconomist @fau1in Seems inflation has also happened for market cap of companies. Not long ago, a 1 trillion dollar company was a seemingly very difficult milestone.

Good luck this week and go make some money!/n<pos> @CNBC The real reason (I‚Äôm guessing) is because they‚Äôre working with Apple. $AAPL $TM/n<neu> @MrBlonde_macro @Namzes_G Look at the spread between savings yields and lending rates. Banks will do disproportionately well. I won‚Äôt touch $AAPL $TSLA or S&amp;P indexes. Not sure if the index is being propped up by a love  for the companies or a love for indexing. But products are discretionary &amp; expensive/n<neg> The reason I am not yet convinced the market is near the bottom:
$AAPL has the most % on $SPY.  New bearish signal is just about to trigger on $AAPL. Remember the first signal at the peak level? If this happens, $AAPL will lose over $30 from the current level @OptionsPastor/n<pos> @BearingtonTrade Well I'm long AAPL and I'll stay long. I'm just stating a fact that it took tesla spot at the top. I find it to be an opportunity. Not news./n<pos> I‚Äôm going to focused and build up 100 shares of my favorite companies. The companies I have 5 companies I want to focus on $AAPL $MSFT $KR $V $PEP

I also have at least 1 position I plan on getting rid of. Big things will be coming/n<neg> @100xAlena That's why I think AAPL is undervalued in the long term...they have your fingerprints, your voice, your face, your patterns in every way, what you search, who your friends are, where you shop, etc etc

nearly half the world uses iphones./n<neu> @BearingtonTrade Next year $AAPL has the potential to reach 200 but in the short term I‚Äôm bearish./n<neu> @ebizexec Samsung Galaxy will likely be under further pressure from Apple iPhone in the US as Samsung makes up the lion share of the market. Trend goes counter to $QCOM strategy of focusing the street on its chip revenue in premium Samsung devices with $AAPL plans to move to its own modem/n<neu> @preem1nent If I put energy or money in, say, AAPL, that gets converted to hardware and software and infrastructure and things of value. In crypto, the energy disappears, the money disappears, and nothing of value is produced./n<neu> @humbledividend $NN.AS

though I also hold your $SBUX, $AQN and $V too, but at lower position sizes. I wish I'd bought more Starbucks earlier this year, when it was such an obvious buy/n<neu> @Callum_Thomas Never owned a bond, 100% stocks and always will be.

CVS, PG, IBM, MSFT, MCD, AAPL, THW, MAIN, CLFD

I have about 18 or 20 positions, go 10% cash when stocks are up, 10% margin when they're down.

Portfolio divided yields about 4.5%.

Up 70% since Biden's inauguration./n<neg> @OptionsRising I understand that bruh. The previous week closed a hammer. What validates a hammer? A candler up closing green. Bruh we got a whole ass bear engulfing down! Took out both sides‚Ä¶.. you still bullish on aapl?/n<pos> @calvinfroedge I agree and have to follow you for this!
$AAPL, $QCOM, $NVDA, $AMD, have to be thinking about having $INTC make chips for them in order to diversify and de-risk their Taiwan supply chains. Plus, $INTC had a nice reversal on Friday, and actually closed green on a bad day./n<neu> @MasterPandaWu Takes patience, faith in process, and time. Your charting, confidence, along with a few I follow,my own exp helped weather volatility. I had a big $aapl put spread long oct and dec 160s &amp; short sept 150s. held through the move up to 164 then banked &amp; rolled down sub 153 and 148/n<pos> $AAPL it looks like APPLE must‚Äôve hit a home run with the iPhone launch. I‚Äôve never seen so many people trying to get into the 2 Kansas City stores./n<neu> @marc_slans For sure.  Definitely has beat an index over a longer time.  Can't go wrong with it.  

Just surprised AAPL didn't juice those recent returns more.  Might be that I'm overestimating its impact on the total BRK portfolio./n<neu> @jasonjscholtz My $aapl cost basis is $14/sh. Sounds silly because I pride myself on security analysis/n<neu> As you all know, stocks ran and they ran hard. Everything I owned began to 4x, 5x, 6x etc etc in value. 

My 200K that I had in $AAPL, $AMZN, and some other stocks flew and I had made over $800K after taxes. 

Mind BLOWN ü§Ø/n<neu> @BearingtonTrade I‚Äôm seeing C&amp;H on $AAPL but that bearish engulfing is definitely concerning. 150 is a pretty strong level. Next support would be 147 and then 140./n<neu> I did this non-stop for about 4-5 years and before the onset of the COVID pandemic started in Feb of 2020, I had about $200K dollars invested into 2 stocks: $AAPL and $AMZN/n<neg> I‚Äôm not gonna lie I‚Äôm dead and a zombie cuz I‚Äôm dead since birth but only on earth as I am God and these are heroine cuz afghans are the taliban of Amazon Prime Minister me alibaba is aapl and Samsung together with google as @cia and @potus is dead in the head on @YouTube but/n<pos> @talbottzink I bought max size $aapl when I started my job that was pretty great. 

I bought 5x the Apple initial weight in $wbd leap calls last year./n<neu> @nickjsheriff I hear a lot about the justice department investigating anticompetitive behavior with $AMZN

I never hear of $AAPL doing anti-competitive behavior until I discovered your account.

Thank you üôè/n<pos> Reading @nickjsheriff‚Äôs tweets made me realize that $AAPL is copying the strategy that $AMZN is using for e-commerce.

For Amazon, they find a thriving product and private label it to boost sales.

For Apple, they find a thriving utility app and they make it an iOS feature./n<neu> I‚Äôm seeing a trend where you share your top 5 holdings based on value. Here‚Äôs mine:

For my long positions in $GOOG, $AAPL, and $AMZN, I stay a bit conservative. I do NOT want them called away as I have a lot of profits in them. I will ALWAYS roll them over if they‚Äôre in jeopardy/n<neg> How come everyone hates the $AAPL take rate, but I never hear complaints about Xbox or Sony‚Äôs? 

Are they providing that much more value to developers?/n<neu> @bradsferguson I do agree this is an increasing geopolitical risk for Tesla.

Nothing seems to suggest otherwise (except hit from strong dollar)./n<pos> @LunarCrush I hope to see TSLA or AAPL! Thanks for the contest!/n<neg> Looking at twitter feed, i see many people complaining about losing money when entering other traders alerts that are Far OTM. Well thats nothing but ur fault, you guys follow trades without knowing the reasons behind it and without even looking at the chart. $spy $roku $aapl/n<pos> As a daytrader I suggest trading WEEKLIES and near the money. 

For EXAMPLE: $AAPL Sep 23 $152.5C with current price at $152.10. Safer contract near the money so less theta burn and larger success possible than a call at $170C for the same date./n<neu> If $AAPL moves under $149. Panic sets in tbh

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Just like $SPY 383. I‚Äôm not convinced that low of day holds. So bulls have to defend these levels here. Best opportunity for them to survive. God speed (I‚Äôm not team bull)/n<neu> @ivan_labrie @VetTechTrader Problem with fading him is he will give opposite opinion in the same day lol
He loves AAPL in the am , says to sell and avoid in the PM./n<neu> i wouldnt rule out some squeezing continuing to happen on $aapl until FOMC. 

most shorted stock, over crowded at the moment./n<neu> @RyanWright84 @LibertyMamaB Are you me? 

Don't do it. I haven't even talked the wife into switching to @SamsungMobile. Too much familiarity with $AAPL OS. Too "dyed-in-the-wool." 

And to that, I can see why $AAPL has so much appeal:

Some consumers prioritize ease-of-use over cutting-edge performance./n<pos> I want AirPods Max now - so just playing $AAPL again this week. üò§üöÄ./n<neg> Bought back a $AAPL put i had sold for the first time.

I usually let it expire worthless, but I had a better look at this and i see that the strike price i chose it wasn't good.

A post-mortem will come./n<neg> @benbakhshi @TrentBlair19 I think most technical traders don't realize their "support" is just $aapl and $googl buying back shares./n<neu> i‚Äôm all scaled out of $AAPL contracts/n<pos> @deadlyyumbreon $154 incoming! Damn, I should have place a call. I‚Äôm starting back up but I‚Äôm trying to trade based off of the volume profile on historical trends. For $SPY, it‚Äôs beautiful. I want to dabble with $TSLA and $AAPL as well. Thoughts?/n<neu> Again from $spy $382 dip buyers stepped in as expected and POWEL pump hype on Wednesday ... As long as market does not pump alot by Wednesday he can pump it , but if already pump alot then he wont push for it:)   .75 coming.. $qqq $tsla $nio $aapl $amzn 

I think i am 100 % clear/n<neu> @alexwestamir @Investingcom As I‚Äôve told everyone in the last couple years, there is no value in #Crypto , if $AAPL closed business today, you‚Äôd have X amount of value in the stock based on cash, property, and other assets it would still hold. #cryptocrash/n<neu> @fitz_keith I believe several growth stocks saw their bottom in May and may retest. The safe havens in $AAPL $XLE $XLU are going down further which will also put pressure on $QQQ and $SPY. So the market has returned to stock picking at least for now./n<pos> I'm done with AAPL here. Was a good win, not trying my luck. Will be waiting for that TSLA pig to fatten up./n<pos> @Matt_Cochrane7 love stuff like this on days like today (&amp; after panic wkend)

what I'm most curious about is the next 15 yrs of founder-led small cap tech co's w significant equity who can face the challenge of mass rising rate velocity &amp; still beat the 'new' establishment (AMZN/MSFT/GOOG/AAPL)/n<neu> @munster_gene If $AAPL doesn‚Äôt stop turning my iPhone X on an off, I‚Äôm switching back to android.

I wonder if this has to do with news of the stock being the most shorted in the market.

You‚Äôre able to see the shorts closing their positions on TSLA after the stock split. 
They straight up said, ‚ÄòNo thanks.‚Äô

Now there‚Äôs ‚Äúbearish‚Äù news on Apple?
‚úåüèº/n<pos> There seems to be a commonly held belief that we all understand big tech companies like $GOOGL $MSFT $AAPL well. No, you probably don't.

They are more fascinating than they appear to be./n<neg> @FlavioMunozM I am already extremely disappointed by management. Adobe never had cash piles like msft, goog, aapl though./n<neu> You should just wait till the pre-order rush is complete and you can get it without long delays i.e. October, November

I can believe those bets are correct.
AAPL goes down and the rest will follow IMO/n<neg> Would $AAPL still be worth $1 trillion when they have to spend a bulk of its cash reserves and take on more debt to build out their supply chains and manufacturing facilities again?

I doubt investors will want to stay invested in the first place./n<neg> @elasticretreat No certainties here. Took "en masse" to imply strong US consumer names like $HD or $CMG or $COST or $PG or $NKE or say $AAPL warning about health of US consumer (which as of now, they have not).

Most likely letting 10/21's do their thing unless we get some face ripper action./n<neu> I hope you all know $AAPL kept $SPY from sub $380 today.

close at $158.00
tops at $158.09

im down 0.50% today 
but feels like down 13%

markets fuck me/n<pos> Unbelievable strength in $AAPL and $TSLA. Which makes you think once those roll over what will happen to $SPY and $QQQ/n<neu> So all the market share from $MSFT $GOOG $META going to keep going straight into $AAPL $TSLA $NFLX??
I guess FANGMAN is becoming ANT
@mcnopus/n<neu> bought more #ampx 9.69 buy order triggered . Stop loss set but ways away from there .

Something smells very very fishy today, and my legs are closed I swear./n<neu> @iTradeContracts That 386 resistance is strong imo. With tomorrow's announcement, I can see it flush during or post announcement. Tesla, meta and aapl showing strength üí™/n<neg> @MasterPandaWu In a macro-environment that is generally negative, buying $AAPL at this level and at this time gives me a sense of "value trapping" for hopeful bulls, at least for the short to mid term. Maybe this is the last place to trap them before market-wide dump./n<pos> @MasterPandaWu Over the last 3 days, 50% of all the gains within the Nasdaq 100 came from only two stocks: AAPL and TSLA.
That's unprecedented for non-reporting days I suppose./n<neu> $aapl $tsla $soxl $spy the only positions I bought today./n<pos> Out my 157.50 AAPL call made some nice bread, may go higher but I'll take it. This market could go sideways and I'd rather be cash/n<pos> I just bought an iPhone 14 on sale and saved 26%.

$AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL bounces 3%.

Yesterday it bounced only 3.5%.

I am a long time owner, but this is comical./n<neg> @zentrader1254 this is pure aapl so i dont trust it
 + both at my resistance spots so i just slapped a stop at 80 on my 69 long and called it a day/n<neu> $TSLA and $AAPL too much weighing in the spy at these price ranges. Tesla nearly $1 Trillion MC get out of here.
I like 3M and Intel at these prices./n<neg> $aapl 157.70 soon 161
but fomc tomorrow so i‚Äôm lil confused what‚Äôs next/n<neu> Y‚Äôall be careful üí° with AAPL
That appears to be a momentum run to me. Just keep a close eye on your gains if you are in there, just a suggestion./n<neu> $AAPL running by itself today on an analyst upgrade. 
I wonder how long until Wedbush dumps their shares onto these retail buyers‚Ä¶/n<neg> @CheddarFlow Without aapl wouldn‚Äôt do any attempt! Feel like Large  trap for tomorrow . Sketchy/n<neg> I knew it was strange to see $AAPL up a fraction with the s&amp;p down 53.
I was hoping  they could take $AAPL down but when they couldn't I cashed in the rest of my profit on my short./n<neu> @DekmarTrades Let's gamble then I hope haha jk AAPL gonna beast this/n<neu> $AAPL
 I think realistically this hits 165 tomorrow/n<neg> I can't believe the Bulls played that $AAPL card.
 I mean it was Genius.
 Pump $AAPL so the market can't sell off big time before the FED meeting./n<neu> I'm neutral on the market gain.
 I would have stayed short if not for $AAPL and $TSLA blowing up higher.
If they weaken I'll short again./n<neg> $aapl this move absolutely makes no sense.  My spider senses tell me something is up.  $spy $qqq/n<pos> $aapl help me hit my day‚Äôs target. Im off the screens.

Good luck the rest of the day traders./n<neg> @GeorgeC1953 Damn G, from your post yesterday morning I put in an order at .75 for the $AAPL 155C 9/23 when it was .82.  Didn't fill of course....those hit $4.20 already todayü§¨ü§¨ü§¨/n<neu> @lord_fed I'm long to the tits on aapl/n<neu> $AAPL front running Powell makes sense, but $TSLA??? What‚Äôs going on/n<neg> $aapl puts entered.  I don't trust this move.  Feels like a rug pull coming.  $spy $qqq $iwm./n<neu> @GaelanHanlon @MarceloPLima Yes, look at $aapl the past say 6 years. $goog has 130 billion+ in cash. Just on higher fed rates they'll increase bottom line like 5%. Or they'll buy back stock. 

Who knows if $goog goes much higher. But I think cashflow plus buybacks will create a floor soon./n<pos> Sold aapl RIGHT before this last pump lol lowkey sick but I've been having wayyyyyy better trading days not being greedy so im chillin/n<neu> $PLTK Playtika Holding Option Alert: Oct 21 $15 Puts at the Bid: 2500 @ $4.82 vs 27295 OI; Earnings 11/2 Before Open [est] Ref=$10.415 [9/20/2022, 6:47:31 AM] [+$900k] Other Sweeps on: $NET $ADBE $MTB $AAPL $GOOG $PGY/n<neu> @RVN_TL10 Ahahaha i wouldn't ever short $AAPL really man.

Don't over trade in today's chop.  Make a plan. If it works great if not, great shouldn't have lost much.   

I don't plan to enter trades today unless major levels tested. Alerts set. going AFC/n<neu> stupid of me to short $aapl the only thing that can save me is if @BrettSimba plays the uno reverse and throws on shrek/n<neu> If $aapl hits $170 I‚Äôll be extremely surprised, seems like it won‚Äôt rise even though I love apple and want them to progress/n<neu> @GianniDiMattia6 @MadConX @MarceloPLima Which is kind of like why $AMZN is down on $RIVN or $BRK.B being down on $AAPL. I guess the algos skip over the actual underlying businesses./n<neg> $SPY I think we'd be down 5% without $AAPL.../n<neu> @Monica___K AAPL holding up here is curious only justification I can think of is it still attracts a safety bid even though short Treas offer 4%./n<neu> FAANG meeting: We need to select someone to hold the market before crash.

Mistake by me/n<neu> I took some $AAPL lottos.

I‚Äôll put my faith in the bond market and not $AAPL investors./n<neu> Absolutely no buyers in $MSFT, absolutely no sellers in $AAPL - makes sense, right?/n<pos> @alihobbalah I prefer $AAPL as a company, especially now is becoming more recurring. 

But right now I prefer $MSFT as a stock:
- recurring with higher margins (should deserve better mult.)
- no China dependence (less than 10% Rev)
- little impact if something happens to Taiwan/n<neg> @Michigandolf I wrote about the horrifying vol in $AAPL around the top of the dotcom boom.  

In retrospect, it looks like easy pickings, with huge moves, but in the moment, any real practitioner knows it was totally untradeable.  

Are you saying same here?/n<pos> @SamMeciar Despite I prefer $AAPL as a company, I believe $MSFT structurally deserves an higher multiple/n<neg> $AAPL $157‚Äì158 is key TL resistance. By then $SPY could do $386s-387s again. That‚Äôs where I will expect a rejection or big break. Aka will scale most and move stops there/n<pos> @arny_trezzi good observation..

I just now fired up an album I bought before most of your employees could walk. 

I was told I have to pay for the privilege of listening to what‚Äôs mine. 

I suffer no delusions. Know that when the time comes, no quarter will be given to your kind.

No one./n<neu> Following on this method, I guess what will be important tomorrow from the FED hike is that it‚Äôs less about how big the rate moves are going to be than it is about how durable they are. If markets will be ripping today i will be on the side of selling the rip maybe even $AAPL/n<pos> For me, buying $TSLA today is like having a time machine that lets me buy $AAPL in 2010./n<neg> @borrowed_ideas i just saw that Kevin O'Leary hates the deal so now I'm warming up to it a bit...

Lina Khan might be a problem, though, as she likes creating problems for everyone but AAPL &amp; MSFT/n<neu> I won't play the rejection until we break below 389.00 for confirmation.

I know many are looking for the post Fed meeting drop but I‚Äôm afraid of a rally post 75bps. Just sitting on my hands.

My top 5 buys today:

$IRM
$AAPL
$VZ
$ABR
$ORCC/n<neu> @westsavannah_ Oh and I took a swing last Friday with AAPL! I messed up by setting a trailing stop so it closed me out before I could take advantage of the bullish momentum later that Monday and Tuesday. I was heated lol But at least I know I did something right. I made baby profits from it./n<neg> @CNBCFastMoney @pboockvar Melissa, I am wondering why grizzly Dan hates $aapl so much?/n<neg> @_d3f4ult I find playing AAPL on the downside to be VERY difficult because it is such a cultist stock (although TSLA is more weird). We all KNOW AAPL should be lower, and it will get lower, but most likely only after most of us have run out of ability to stay in the game./n<pos> @sararolee @Braczyy I also really like $AMD and $AMZN calls rn

$AAPL failed to hold 153.50 today which is a massive Dark Pool print level with 41M shares-
I‚Äôd like to see it fully recovered before I get in calls/n<neu> @GarawaGrawa I will add once $AAPL $AMZN comes under $100, $TSLA 250 level. Bear market will be here till end of next year and we get these prices sometime next year./n<neu> $AAPL Apple Option Alert: Nov 18 $150 Puts Sweep (37) near the Ask: 1800 @ $7.1 vs 28987 OI; Earnings 10/27 After Close [est] Ref=$153.48 [9/22/2022, 10:52:19 AM] [+$900k] Other Sweeps on: $FXI $LYV $ORLY $NMM $OVV $SLCR/n<pos> @BenBerdankweed I see an opportunity coming, I think the AAPL and TSLA will be under their real price, and when this cycle ends, they will have a huge appreciation./n<neu> Market makers going to GAP us below $AAPL ‚Äòs demand zone.

As I said earlier mkts need $AAPL and $TSLA both bouncing hard with it.  $MSFT $GOOGL and $META aint gonna cut it without help./n<pos> @MarkMcGrathCFP @TMtgSpecialist Yeah, sorry I was being facetious.
A house is basically access to cheap leverage; 10% down and get 9x your downpayment for a mortgage. It's cheap specifically because it is a physical asset.

If you had $1M in AAPL stock, those sweet dividends would also pay for your lifestyle./n<neg> What‚Äôs funny is I chose between $AAPL and $TSLA today to scalp and I ended up picking the stock that tanked instead of sustained like what $AAPL is doing right now.

RFFE is more challenging than rockets, you are short on both money and timeüòú
Even if AAPL buys MTEK, I do not see them beating QCOM in 5G features/n<neg> @David_Tracey Makes sense.  I had bought AAPL puts weeks ago when it went back above 172, and then sold for nearly a double when it hit 163.  ...so hard to time the exits on winning options positions.   too many times, I got greedy and held, and then got burned with fast reversals.../n<neg> $AAPL failed breakout just as I had envisioned I had my stop too tight puts woulda paid right there üòÖ/n<neu> @ecommerceshares I mean, I would like to think that my longs have bottomed. 

But the 60/40 ‚Äúsafety‚Äù portfolio of $AAPL / $TSLA has very likely not bottomed. So the market will go lower?

There will be months of churn in any event./n<neu> @Truth8eeker @SKundojjala Based on $AAPL resources and capital. I am sure you probably know this but $AAPL does more in free cash flow in one quarter than the market value of Mediatek. RFFE is not rocket science reusable rockets./n<pos> I really think $META is crude now but they will have a massive iPhone moment like $AAPL in the near future.

If the device and software are good enough to even get people to use it for 10-20 minutes every day at the beginning even to just "explore"

I received a buying call for $MRK ( $DIA),  but gamma in $AAPL is negative.
Maybe it is just in tech. 
Dow is more diversified.
Yesterday $MSFT got to it‚Äôs level of June. 
Thank you./n<neu> @David_Tracey In my view $aapl is expensive.   Who has $1000 for a new iphone in these times ?   On the other side I like the new watch and the new plugs.    $aapl is a cash cow.  Also in difficult times.   Also Warren is still buying./n<pos> I went long $AAPL 151.60s with a stop at 151 even. Good R/R

Daily charts of all indices

Either

"Since if [___] is unable to attract more investors, the price would simply collapse"

Where [___] == $BTC, $ETH, $XRP, $ADA, $SHIB, $DOGE, $GOOG, $AAPL and literally everything else in existence.

#Perpetual #motion does not yet exist./n<neu> @CrixusEsq @theSloopJohnM @LukeBeakly AAPL at 25x trailing P/E is neither cheap nor expensive. Not sure what the forward multiple for it is right now but it could easily drop to 15x or around 90 bucks / share if things get really dire. I would be a buyer at those levels for a nice short-term gain./n<neu> @hrafntho @stevencmutter I'll give them credit for filling that market hole. My concern is that $AAPL is a public zombie underneath it all.

and as Apple is moving strongly into health, they have an obligation now, and perhaps we cement a legal obligation as there are conflicting motivations there./n<neu> Recap for 9/22 &amp; 9/23

9/23: 5W 1L +6.5R

9/22: 4W 1L +5R

I only trade the following tickers
$SPY $QQQ $AAPL $AMD $AMZN $META $MSFT/n<neg> @TheStalwart AAPL sits at 150.
Now I find it annoying!/n<neg> I remember buying $AAPL shares in 2009. People were selling everything then too. Well guess what, I more then 10x my investment in Apple and rolled that into $NIO in 2019, which is up around 10x even with the lousy stock performance of late. Nobody gets rich following the herd./n<neu> @raymond10mm @juliusagusta $AAPL has access to higher end chips than $INTC only makes sense if they wanted to get into the server business, but that‚Äôs not their niche./n<neu> Took profits on both the $BX bear spread, which was up by over 150%, and the $SPY bear spread, which was up roughly 300%. Better to take profits than wonder why I didn't.

The bear spread on $AAPL, as well as the put on $TSM and the call on $VIX are unchanged./n<neu> I‚Äôve been buying some $GSAT. I‚Äôve been loading up on satellite companies: Here is the thesis and catalyst for $GSAT - 

1. $AAPL partners with $GSAT for satellite connectivity to iPhone 14 

2. $AAPL stands up an investment fund for satellite technology/n<neu> Interesting that while $SPX is at its June lows today, $AAPL is about 15% from its own low from the same time. I thought generals were getting shot last/n<neu> @MrTopStep I thought aapl was a woman ü§£‚òÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è/n<neu> @Kennstro Hey, I‚Äôm on AAPL $145 and TSLA $270 FSLR $125./n<neu> $AAPL took 160 calls for 11/18/22
Reason is because weekly chart looking like a reversal. 

Target for me is 155 next week./n<pos> I don't own $aapl but I always want it up ! over 150 there we go $spy/n<pos> Sold (50) UAN $100 puts for $4

I would LOVE to buy more at $96...

Also, got $1 for $AAPL $142 puts next week which have been the lower leg of my calendar spreads

My October $160 puts now have a NEGATIVE cash basis.../n<neu> @optionsmafia1 I remembered when you corrected cheddar on his flow (he‚Äôs gotten better since then lol) the rookies posted this $aapl trade as bullish. When I seen your tweet I put the brakes on the trade üòÖ. GOAT by my standards./n<neg> Who is sitting there thinking, "i gotta be long into the weekend." Absolutely insane. $QQQ $SPY $IWM $AAPL $TSLA/n<neg> To me, it feels like $AAPL is one of the last men standing. Lose $AAPL, lose the lows. That's my thought/n<pos> Started this morning by adding to $AAPL $MSFT and $VYM and just added more to $KO.

Every time it did this in the past 13 years, it went to a 10 P/E which is when I bought, in 2013, 2016, and 2019.

It never went over 20 P/E in a period of low rates from 2009 to 2020.

AAPL is going to $50 dollars, yes 66% down from here./n<neu> The only unfilled gap I can find (4 hour) below current price for $AAPL is 132.55 from June 17th. Yes, it would surprise me too. I‚Äôve loaded 10/7 $145 puts. There is nothing to support this market except the point where buyers return in strength.  What will it take?/n<neu> In @PowerTradingRm when @themissinglinks mentions $AAPL weekly call sweeps on down $SPX day usually means good setup for reversal. Today he mentions $AAPL 0dte PUT sweeps, which I don't know if he's ever mentioned.

If AAPL tanks you can be damn sure SPY will too.. but doesn't seem true the other way around. Very frustrating.

Well done with UVXY.. I lost faith in it.

And, yeah, big oof today. Shorts and large cash position helped./n<neg> Closed out ALL of my shorts other than:

- Long $AAPL Oct $160 Puts
- 1/2 of my $FIVE short

Did markets bottom? I don‚Äôt think so but taking profits never hurts.

I expect another dip on Monday, which will lead to a crash or we start the next bear market rally. $SPY $AEX $AAPL $NASDAQ $DJIA/n<neu> @CFPStrategist4U @StealthQE4 There was such a huge hammer in the Russell, I tossed some bucks at it to see if it bounces from the new low.

‚Ä¶ &amp; Thanks to @MArgersinger &amp; @aaron_bush_ for banging the drum for $MELI.
Long time Fool since 1998 i.e. the Hard Copy days.  Long $MELI since 2014; Today $MELI is my #3 position after $AMZN &amp; $AAPL.
p.s. Guys- How about an ‚ÄúOdcast‚Äù Reunion?!/n<neu> @bryanaat @anthonynoto @SoFi Yup. But pretty much nothing I own is green on the year except for $AAPL @ 3% &amp; $TSLA @ 6.66%.  $GOOG -30%, and $META -60%. Everything in fintech over -70%. SBC will phase down over the next year. I am committed for a minimum 3 years. But I hope @SoFi is alifelong asset for me./n<neu> @TSLAFanMtl I had $30 in dividends come in last night, sadly, none of that went to $TSLA, but I did pick up some fractional shares of $AAPL, $INTC, $AMZN, $NVDA, $QCLN, and $GOEV though./n<neg> @neiltyson In some other universe, I did end up investing in $QCOM, $AAPL, $GOOG, $FB, and $TSLA.. sadly, just not in this one &gt;.&lt;/n<pos> @Mahmoodeblanco @AdamMancini4 Very true, I‚Äôm already 80% cash.  Going get a little more out of AAPL if possible./n<neu> I‚Äôll step in &amp; buy $AAPL &amp; $TSLA under $100 sounds crazy but looking at the charts with the FED putting pressure on tech, they need to be deflated to fair value. Once Apple show weakness it‚Äôs over for the S&amp;P/n<neu> @PaoloMaldiniElC @MadThunderdome I think you‚Äôre correct.

IMO it‚Äôs easier to play in a bull market than a bear market. I lost a good trade on AAPL early this week. Had some $145p‚Äôs and got stomped out. AAPL is strong and will be the last one to fall. I believe if you want to catch her buy some time./n<neg> @paulcerro @YoungMoneyCap @MoS_Investing I don't think anyone in the CTV space is bullish on the prolonged success of dongles, if all new TVs sold are 'smart' you would be relying on the consumer disliking the default OS of TV they bought &amp; going out to buy a dongle for a new OS  (AAPL,ROKU,AMZN all have dongles)/n<neu> @RxPillMe @BluSuitDillon Maybe. Maybe biden was just bluffing saying they'd defend taiwan. 

Also i never said anything about AAPL, but yes./n<neu> @galletta_mariah @Smartnetworth1 I‚Äôve owned $AAPL $V and $NKE for over a decade and added along the way. Owned $AMZN for 3 years and $ALLY is a new position./n<neu> @RideMotherNatur To be completely honest I've mainly just been trading $SPY and $ES_F futures and a few major names like $TSLA, $NVDA, and $AAPL

They are strong companies./n<neg> I say get out before AAPL and TSLA go into freefall/n<neu> Thinking about it and I feel like the only way for the markets to run higher is if $AAPL goes to $146.70 first which will bring everything else down with it.

Stocks like $AAPL, $NVDA, $AMD, $TSLA, $GOOGL, $META, etc all move in sync with $SPY &amp; $QQQ

Try this out &amp; thank me laterüôè/n<neu> $COIN $RBLX $RIVN all closed green on the day despite $SPY &amp; $QQQ being red on the day.

$AAPL closed green on the week, and didn't even break the previous week's lows despite $SPY &amp; $QQQ doing so.

Makes me wonder - why the relative strength?

ü§î/n<pos> What would you all like a vid on this week? I want to help comment on what you need.. If you prefer to DM me a suggestion that's fine too... There is no silly suggestions i will do whatever will help you guys no matter how basic you may think it is $SPY $QQQ $AMZN $AAPL/n<neu> @Dirtman07942740 It‚Äôs a bearish continuation pattern 

The daily chart has a double bottom and bottoming wicks while also at its 50% fib support area off previous swing low 
With the $spx at support 

It‚Äôs a good pattern but Everything I listed above is what it‚Äôs up against $aapl/n<neg> @contrarian8888 Forbes is clickbait negative aapl with zero meaningful substance.

I would suggest to exit those unless you are only in them for daytrading./n<neu> @doyendon @iamtomnash I‚Äôve done both, so can track the results.  Not even close. Develop a safety net, then swing for the fences.

If MSFT, AAPL fall, it will be for a reason. At that time, things will not be nice for growth stocks, because they cannot grow, no matter how much cash they burn./n<pos> @MarkNeuman18 My cynical hunch is that there‚Äôs plenty more to come.

Gap between $AAPL price today and June lows is incredible.

The target of aapl in my opinion is ~120 during this crash. Unlike bulls‚Äô 200 or bears‚Äô 100. I do think 120 is a fair price for aapl THIS year. But next year?

hjealthy for breadth../n<neg> $SPY I see a huge crash coming today bulls watch out $AAPL is going down it is all an illusion/n<neu> @blueshirt_plus Was thinking the other day, I wonder how much demand for $AAPL iPhones is just from carrier giveaways? $1400 phone free for $30 a month takes 4 years to break even?/n<neg> How concerned should I be that $AAPL is not participating in today's rally? @TheMaverickWS/n<pos> What is impressive is that we‚Äôre strong today considering the weakness and weight in $aapl . However For me to get even a little bit buy biased for the next day , the $qqq would need to build above yesterday‚Äôs highs . Let‚Äôs see how it plays out rest of day/n<neg> @BankerBob444 I wouldn't short $AAPL here.  It can and might go lower but entry level is not ideal/n<neg> Lmao $aapl down 4% but $spx up 1%ü§îü§î

Sellers are exhausted this should be at 3500 normally. 

Wanted 3850 i want 3950 now/n<neg> I think its time to nibble. the fed has to come and defend the us dollar. the fed is not fighting inflation, there just becoming a member of ESG. Witch is bad for a bull market. $aapl $goog $xom $soxl $tsla/n<neu> @SupremeOptions Come on AAPL fill that gap I need my spy calls to print/n<neg> @MMeatloaf7 A pump like this with AAPL down over 3.5%???? That's what screams algo fuckery to me. Once DXY bounces, the weakness of AAPL will drop the market like a rock./n<neu> Yesterday I alerted $AAPL puts at $152.5 &amp; $SPY calls at $361 ‚úÖüèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> $AAPL- I‚Äôm watching for her to stay under $148.55 intraday./n<neu> The best advice I can give right now is :  This  is a market for trading and not investing !!! 

$spy $qqq $btc $tsla $nflx $biib $aapl $sofi $vtnr $enph $Envx $f $lcid $amd $intc etc‚Ä¶/n<neg> @CoachDipka I'm short. Looks like the same pop and drop of last 2 days. This time $aapl is shitting the bed as well. Tight stop since price crossed the 50 on the system./n<neg> You got to love how we just heard of the increased short position in $ AAPL last week and then coincidentally, a "secret source" from Apple told Bloomberg they are slowing demand. I mean how rigged is this market. The @ SECGov lets this stuff slide. It's frustrating./n<neg> @hmeisler More than certain folks. I read that $AAPL is the most shorted stock now/n<pos> @garyblack00 I would not do it for any other reason then Geo political risks of Taiwan. It‚Äôs what I did days ago. I think it‚Äôs a smart move for institutional investors. 

I love $AAPL, so ‚òùÔ∏è is painful.

$AAPL  PUTS $35k  32% üü¢ ( 9.33 AM )

STILL HOLDING SPX CALLS RUNNERS  UP 35% MY STOP LOSE 15%+/n<neu> @BradLitwin1 @Bill_Schuknecht Smart. Closed my LRCX CC -68, but could not take the chance of bigger loss. I put on a couple single Gamma strangles, MU, AAPL. MU earnings tomorrow after the bell...expect big move one way or another./n<neu> $aapl down 3% and #sp500 up 1.25% that's random I wonder if aapl will correct with $spy and make today a 2% green day?/n<pos> If Apple makes it back over 148.50, then we may have seen the lows with a wash n rinse by the fund buyers. And could see a run ahead. #AAPL/n<pos> @contrarian8888 Didn't have the conviction to short $AAPL, but I hope I made right by doubling my $BTU ownership to 40k shares. Great call for now though, hopefully you'll able to convert the short winnings to more $BTU or $PANR cherries!/n<pos> @hmeisler lol, I actually live on a 1m chart when trading, but more of a function of $IWM up 2% already.  More interested to see if $AAPL nibblers snap up quickly and head back into the gap today or tomorrow./n<neu> @3PeaksTrading u said it.  AAPL.  TSLA next?
cud be historic pain trade shaking out shortz (that'd be me) prior resuming downtrend.
note:  staying short/n<neg> @TheBon_Scott @jimcramer Nah just the last 4% to break/gap AAPL below the key support level of $150 that everyone was watching. Sorry I don't trust "anonymous sources"./n<neg> Both $AAPL and $TSLA red, I don't trust this rally./n<neu> $AAPL finally slipping here, still 10% above June lows while all other mega caps are below it with exception of $TSLA. However indices managing to hold up this move well so far. Q3 ER in 2-3 weeks, guidance is going to suck there, I think we've priced only some of it so far/n<pos> @CyberDog2 I sniped $AAPL calls myself LOL!!/n<neg> @SideDemand More pain is always possible. When stocks like $HSY and $WMT have a higher PE, I won‚Äôt call $AAPL expensive. But based on its own historic metrics, $AAPL still isn‚Äôt cheap here./n<pos> Got back in the day trading groove today with some AAPL calls. Not a lot of profit as I jumped too early on it, but feels good to make some back after losing on AMZN twice yesterday./n<neg> @jablamsky Holding long puts so I'm biased as hell. I just don't like the valuation. It's still at 23x earnings despite its exposure to China. 

Say the market bottoms at 14x, which is optimistic. If $AAPL commands a 30% premium, that should put it around 18x. 

I think there's more pain./n<neu> @gurgavin Probably because when SPY was dropping hard AAPL was going up. I think "smart money" has started using it as a safe haven to store cash./n<pos> i am more calm now regarding fears over war.  and my PL has helped, especially the unwind of the short  JPM (likely other names as well ) and long AAPL.   A Citadel or similar.   so raising head and trying to figure out least risky way to play the upcoming surge in SP500/n<neu> @SideDemand Lol that‚Äôs possible. You know it‚Äôs a tough market when you don‚Äôt feel comfortable holding $AAPL short puts for longer than a few minutes./n<neg> Psst, one other thing to keep in mind... $NQ is still in negative momentum swing right now. I know we're all dumping our $AAPL shares, but 11,515ish is purple bband./n<neg> @jablamsky 'I know it's $AAPL' is gonna burn a lot of people this cycle/n<neg> I took $AAPL long off the bottom for a 20% gain. Sold $137 put and held for 21 minutes. 

I know it‚Äôs $AAPL, but I don‚Äôt trust this market to hold on for longer./n<neu> Back in my SQQQ, I‚Äôve been waiting for AAPL to blink and it just did. The flush isn‚Äôt over, NASDAQ has a ways to go to reach bottom!/n<neu> @TheCoalTrader Short covering bc of degrossing ($AAPL vs everything else today) plus EoQ book marking. 

I‚Äôm being patient next few days./n<neu> @DividendBreeder I think $AAPL i still 10% over fair value - should be around $130/n<pos> @MacroTactical Well to be fair.. AAPL been outperforming massively SPX and NDX, so fair game I‚Äôd rather say?/n<neu> @Mike_Taylor1972 $AAPL down 4% $NDX up ~1%.

I never seen that in my 27 years. 

$NDX strong buy/cover./n<neu> I want you to think for a minute how much time you‚Äôre devoting to AAPL and trying to trade a range (if you are)with a few hundred shares and how much you‚Äôre really gaining by skimming a couple bucks here and there vs a guy who has $150B of it and sits on his hands./n<neu> played $aapl rollups this morning with B then flipped to $spx calls. I will add more calls over 3700 if we get there. taking profits when we see them. $qqq over 280 can begin to bounce harder/n<neg> @Liathetrader Same, maybe it's the hipster vibes but I have always had a problem with AAPL. And I own an iphone, lol/n<neu> $AAPL Flattened up. I had a Bear Put Ratio on that benefits from a down move, BUT in Oct &amp; I want flexibility. Debating doing one in a near dated series or waiting for closer to earnings, which is more likely. I'll discuss in my SF video after the Close. All about Gamma &amp; Vega./n<neg> @fly4dat $QQQ $SPY both successfully defended June low even with the bad $AAPL news. Another bear market rally just started from today's low? BTW the $appl production cut news smells like a fake news spread by market manipulator. So I bought large position of $aapl at $145./n<neu> Up on @realmoney Sep 28, 2022 | 10  AM EDT DOUG KASS
Rotational Rhetoric (From The Contrarian Corner)!
Talking out loud, will the perceived weakness at Apple $AAPL result in monies moving out of the name and into depressed tech (read: ($META) ($AMZN) ($MSFT) and ($GOOGL) )?/n<pos> More interestingly to me is the resilience of $AAPL $AMZN $ETH $TSLA and even crypto #Bitcoin relative to their June lows

The market in general has reached new lows the past few days, yet the most risky end of the risk curve is off the lows pretty significantly/n<neu> $AAPL hit 147.43 from 145.23 number although I didnt take it because it bounced too much for me in front of it. 
$LI risky number of 24.63 bounced to 25.6
$MT risky number of 19.34 hit and bounced to 19.67
The risky numbers are because it's going to open right around that number/n<neu> @judahrhodie Yes, But I loaded NQs long OVN at 11210 (posted) on the AAPL likely fud.
Trimmed some here. More dry power for generational lows./n<neu> If you told me $AAPL down 4%+ yet $QQQ flat yesterday I wouldn't have believed it. Breadth improvement in tech related to possible short-term top in $TNX. If the 10Y drops 3.8% may see 3.3-3.5%, which provides relief for equities üòå

$AAPL a big whatever burger - personally look forward to the day somebody X displaces Iphone like $BB died - shit device - buggy as hell - all hype and a stock promote like no other

Don't ask me about it. Green trade/n<neg> @CL_fTrader $AAPL Lines around the block on iPhone release day nowhere to be seen, but personally I think they are failing in other product lines as well.

Hedged $AAPL position with covered calls out to mid-October; uggh.
Wish I knew something about Biotech. First $REGN &amp; $LLY now $BIIB.

Finding strong ideas ( $AMD and $AMZN both crossing the hourly 50 RSI into open, and coming out of MACD/RSI bottoms from a couple days ago)
If $AAPL had recovered stronger I'm sure they would have ran, but provided a nice pop after dipping to buy zone./n<neg> @TicTocTick Im pissed @tim_cook I just spent 4k on a computer n phone n you send me bum phone then send me refurb phone thinking I‚Äôm a cuck I know new phone have mm but best part is‚Ä¶.

It‚Äôs an outdated company, look at their website, look at their flagship product: iPhone , it‚Äôs obsolete. 

I will warm up to it again at 99 dollar now 145 dollar./n<neu> As if on cue, rumors on $AAPL iPhone production. We some production is shifting out of China into India, so maybe that's it? It seems super convenient timing. I'm actually short via Put Ratios, but skeptical none the less. Bears need $AAPL to crack. Below $150-$147 is vulnerable./n<neu> Taking a position in $AAPL 9/30 150c @ 0.70 to swing.

I‚Äôll step in front of the freight train./n<pos> @YocumsCharting I literally was just pondering the same things $AAPL is done pretty big on the demand news and now the market goes green üò¨/n<neg> You got to love how we just heard of the increased short position in $AAPL last week and then coincidentally, a "secret source" from Apple told Bloomberg they are slowing demand. I mean how rigged is this market. The @SECGov lets this stuff slide. It's frustrating./n<neu> $NFLX NEW HIGH IS $232.08

If people are amazed by $AAPL going DOWN OVER -$6.00!

They are going to sleep on $NFLX. The last time I posted about this on $NFLX 2nd POP! It came DOWN OVER -$20.00! Lets keep this post updated ‚è≥‚òïüö¨/n<neu> @ArturoVandelayI @kayfabecapital Yup.
And ironically, I just looked for Q numbers...so AAPL actually crushing +6% still vs QQQ -2% and SPY -6%....stuff is all sorts of upside down most places.
Toto, this is not Kansas anymore....
Oh and good thing NOBODY owns AAPL....../n<neu> $AAPL 155 Calls are 13 bucks, we might be able to pick them up as low as 8 today. Unless it turns right now. Then now is the time to buy
And at 13 I'm not passing it up. Even if sell them for just 20 today

Keep SL tight and take that profit/n<pos> $hd. I fully plan to add puts on this one.  Just dumb.  $aapl buyers and @cnbc will do their best to make apple green today.   They love apple./n<pos> $AAPL if u are new to investing, buy Apple shares right here right now. Just 1 share. Yes 1 share. Then on ever red day, buy another share. Do this for the next 265 trading days. I‚Äôm pretty sure you will be green by then. Yes that‚Äôs DCA but on red days only./n<neg> obvious now was being run over by someone(s)   who had the other side to my pairs trade long JPM and short AAPL.  They are dumping about 3 weeks of accumulation now.     and there is this massive gamma flows.  what I dont think they got, or maybe too big to do it, the construct./n<neu> $AAPL huge volume on the hourly candle only 30 mins in.

I agree, the big boys still have long way down. $aapl, $msft, $googl, $amzn, $tsla/n<neg> I feel like $AAPL has to go back up to retest $150 and fail for the market to head lower./n<neu> Seems to me with $AAPL dropping bad news and red this AM, the other FAANG are pumping this morning to keep $SPY propped up. What do I know./n<neg> Damn I‚Äôm in the red rn, was not expecting spx and crypto to move positive this morning with that AAPL news!/n<neg> I didn't think I'd ever see a day where the whole stock market wants to go up but $AAPL is weighing the index down./n<neg> $AAPL might work but that number was not good for me after it it bounced about .60c or so in front of it.  U see how its trying to hold that number 145.23?/n<pos> started little $AAPL to my long port. $144.95, and will slowly add more.

Hope we go down to 130s so i can double down.

China, india, and many other countries huge oppty in coming years. US, just passed 50% phone market (vs android phones).

PE is reasonable and 2.2 peg./n<neu> I‚Äôve been thinking about adding $AAPL, nice opp. today maybe, but the market feels like it‚Äôll go lower. ü§î/n<pos> I would love a rally into the end of the week so I can reload some puts. $SPX $AMD $NVDA $AAPL $QQQ $CRM $DDOG/n<neu> @MWM76 I went with the QQQ.  $AAPL is still off 4% today.  This bounce is to be faded.  The BOE is moving out of desperation but the fed is not going to flinch (YET)./n<neu> @Trade_With_Mr_X Also, a small possibility I suppose that it‚Äôs breaking off from being a leading indicator perhaps. AAPL this AAPL that for a decade and for good reason but maybe its reign is over. TSLA perhaps to be the next biggest US stock? Idk just some thoughts/n<neg> $AAPL being currently below 150 scares me, I expect a retracement to 150 at the very least./n<pos> @MomAngtrades I love when people try to make aapl sound like they are going crash. Aapl ain‚Äôt going anywhere. I love the emotion people put into trading/n<pos> $AAPL falls but $BRKB is up.

(Bias: I'm in puts)/n<neg> so let me get this straight. $AAPL down 4% on sales fears. what a joke. I am not a fan of aapl and i know they will sell every widget they make and at a premium. so to freak out over demand is silly as can be. stop being a sheople and use ur brains./n<neg> @Trade_With_Mr_X I tend to think aapl is leading, not catching up.

Resistance 148.4, 151.8, 153.8. Support 145.6, 143.9, 142.1./n<neg> $ES speculators 3rd largest short position ever so I suspect this pre market ramp is nothing more than a low liquidity squeeze.

Between the pipeline explosions, Yellen throwing in the towel &amp; $AAPL reducing their production this thing is going to open &amp; get demolished, I think./n<neu> @kingkang80 @ValueStockGeek I think the only person NOT worried about the $AAPL exposure is WB../n<neu> @Hugh_Henne Although, I don‚Äôt think $AAPL will see anything lower than 118ish./n<pos> I miss trading AAPL options.

$SPX red to green overnight, if it defends 3645 possible we see a move towards 3700-3721 again. I'd consider calls above 3700. Puts can work if SPX fails at 3645

$AAPL lower on demand news. Let's see if it drops to 145 next

After 9/30 into 10/31 - I strongly believe the big play is to short tech stocks that have shown strength till now. $TSLA $AAPL $ETSY/n<neu> I don‚Äôt like to go into the market with any bias but today might be a quick pump and dump imo. BOE is putting a hold on QT, $AAPL cuts production do to lack of iPhone 14  demand and J. Powell speaks at 10. Regardless of my thoughts always set your levels and manage risk. $SPY $ES/n<neu> $AAPL NOOO I wanted to addddd lol chillllll/n<neg> The $AAPL Apple iPhone news seems like a smear campaign to me. I do not doubt that they rolled back some production estimates due to demand. 

Apple has tons of people employed for planning and scheduling for this very reason. Companies SHOULD adjust production‚Ä¶/n<neg> @Hugh_Henne Aapl at $92 will make me throw up lol/n<neu> @Hugh_Henne If I do a valuation of aapl I get a oddly low number.

So far the market didn't fall apart with $AAPL news.  I will be cautious on short side./n<pos> If $SPX and $QQQ shrug off the $AAPL news and move higher anyway, then it will result in an impressive squeeze.
I wouldn't mind that. Give me $SPY back to 400 and $TSLA to 315 (#AiDay on Friday) so to reenter shorts./n<pos> If $AAPL revisits between 125-130 I will be hammering 160 LEAPs. Checks out technically for me and fundamental thesis = 1) simply put - it is a good company that will continue to innovate and 2) they dominate the U.S. market and have plenty of room to expand internationally./n<neu> People expect today to be a big drop because of the $AAPL. I think it'll turn green. I think a crash is brewing, not quite yet. Best we can do is try to position for both possibilities. My choice: long with short term hedge gambles. If a big crash comes hedges will more than pay./n<pos> @Mr_Derivatives From what I understand, $aapl has lower sales than expected of their new model, BUT, they still expect to sell as many phones as last year.... During a recession. That's still pretty damn good, imo. I don't expect this $aapl drop to stick/n<neu> #Apple (#AAPL) stock has dropped 4% in pre market trading after reports they are dropping their plans to boost production of their latest iPhone model. @TheMaverickWS ‚Äòs recent video mentions #AAPL‚Äôs significance in the trajectory of the market, I‚Äôm going to open more shorts now/n<neg> Shit I forgot Twitter code should of said I was still short $aapl  45344 spots left in room/n<neu> Purposely bought last years $AAPL model to lower revenue.

Given premarket $aapl down so much but index helding.  So we should see some squeeze today.  Again watch price action./n<neu> @smartertrader Sam, did market survive through two huge negative and one huge positive news (nord stream, AAPL and BoE), does that suggest market strength?
(or am I just bias because right now I am long üòÇ)/n<neu> @Smartnetworth1 I don't disagree with you. 

But the macro environment is rapidly shifting (see Bank of England this morning). A lot to shake out.

Remember - anyone who likes AAPL now could have bought it for less than 140 three months ago..../n<neu> @WallStreetSilv Kind of feel like the $AAPL warn prediction from Bloomberg was already a built in prediction. Is this more icing on the cake or another whole piece of cake for this bear?/n<neu> @tradertvneal Neal, hypothetically (education purposes only)... if you held an AAPL short overnight, would you go ahead and close pre-market while its popping up, or hold for the open and wait? I wonder if $142 is a possibility today. Thanks!/n<neu> Today I will wait an overbought level on $QQQ to think to go short. Also looking to short #AAPL if goes down after the open/n<neu> I'm not tweeting any pump and dumps, just sound tickers with huge potential. $FLGC has my attention.

I‚Äôm not okay./n<pos> Good Morning! Overnight looked pretty wild!

Then a promise of emergency QE from the BoE helped the market relax./n<neu> @DivesTech Me thinks Wallstreet wants to buy more AAPL so a little Bloomberg FUD to shake out the loose hands/n<neu> @ValueStockGeek That's why I just buy $brkb and DCA down (prefer it to the $spy).  They having loads of money in treasury bills allows them to sleep well at night.  The $aapl exposure is a bit much though/n<neu> I know I don't have a lot of followers, I typically use twitter as a litmus test, but for younger traders and investors I feel a civic duty to warn whomever will listen. We haven't seen anything yet. $AAPL is just now cracking. Look how high above the pre-covid high we are still./n<neu> $AAPL now under $148. support line.
Can the $SPY rally without $AAPL participating?
I don't believe so, but we'll see./n<neg> I'm not sure how s&amp;p futures are only down 18?
With $AAPL &amp; $TSLA down so much.
 Should be down much more.

Good luck today üôåüèª I Fucking hate $aapl and had it man, sometimes stocks I swear just fuck with me. Part of the game but man piss me off./n<neg> @StonkSleeper I know. Big sell off at open.

Little risky, but I think we can get there with the $AAPL news on slower production./n<neg> I covered $aapl too soon now I‚Äôm sad üòû/n<neu> And so far this pre-market, $SPY has not offed itself. I think $AAPL will recover from this overrreaction for being in-line with a forecast. 

Need to see production below 90m to start getting worried/n<pos> Dispersion is here. Indices in US have been resilient relatively speaking because of $AAPL and $TSLA. If a lower ticket item like APPLE sees demand slowdown I can only imagine bigger ones like Tesla./n<neg> Yikes! I laid out the bearish $AAPL chart scenario yesterday and this morning #Apple broke down. As #ScottRedler said it got below that 148+ support and now must stay below.
The gap down is a mind f**k so I have to be careful redshorting./n<neg> It's a war zone now as we are getting close to October.

But after $AAPL's warning and Deese saying "no Plaza Accord" tonight, it seems to me that this move up was led by smaller shitcos. IMO this green is sus/n<neu> (2)
I have bought some calls (ES 4300 for Dec.2022) just in case and unwound my short positions.

APPLE DOWN 3% PREMARKET...DITCHING IPHONE PRODUCTION INCREASE AFTER DEMAND FALLS.../n<neu> From a personal POV, $AAPL has been a safe-haven and 'sacred cow' in many portfolios.

I even ran a search on Kuo and it appears that, IMO, he is a good analyst on AAPL since 2011./n<neu> ES is back above 3640 for the 2nd time after a drop to 3622.75.

Then AAPL just cut production, and TSLA will do that.

So it's actually watch both companies melt into the ground.

Have a nice day./n<neg> it means management lack any serious credibility. It was clear as I mentioned a few days back that $AAPL was trying to goose iPhone 14 sales by increasing the number of selling days in the quarter. Maybe they were trying to manufacture numbers and fake it, I dunno, or maybe they/n<neg> I may have mentioned on here that what was going to happen was $AAPL was going to warn and tank the indexes.

Most stocks are already way more beaten up than apple./n<neg> @agnostoxxx Le Shrubbery, we are on the eve of economic collapse. TFG i am short as $AAPL whiffs/n<neu> @CraigMako @MFHoz I'd bet that a lot of smaller cap positions were rotated into AAPL recently based on indices vs AAPL.

Then again, it might also just be these foreign players buying in too.  It's become an edifice of bubble-ology./n<pos> @ka1n0s @MFHoz Excellent, well done. 

I wonder if we've ever had this large of a market cap influence (not the cap # itself, but $AAPL's % of the overall S&amp;P, roughly 7.4%) ever just rope an anchor around an index and drag everything down with it...

We're about to see./n<pos> @StockSwingAlert It‚Äôs okay, my 12 pro that I got in june of last year gets about half way through my day before dying‚Ä¶ old habits die hard $aapl/n<pos> $AAPL I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised with upgrades tomorrow, supporting the stock arguing the recent pullback and oversold levels.

My point on this tweet is that, no matter what, $meta will underperform $aapl coz fuck zuck.

Side note, isn't it crazy to go from 80% GM, to 23% PM. I hope they cut a lot more costs/n<pos> @elonmusk 
I'm noticing that $TSLA has greater influence in the market these days.
 It's competing with $AAPL for the most influential top stock.
 It's ahead of $MSFT &amp; $AMZN as importance to the Market.
 @MasterBJones/n<neu> @MomAngtrades I have $AAPL and $TSLA #PUT./n<pos> @InnocenceCapit1 If you get only flattish or even slightly declining revenue in a rising interest rate environment and what looks to be a global recession, I think that's pretty good. 

Maybe aapl multiples come down but then that really depends on aapl's 80-100 billion in share buybacks./n<pos> $AAPL producing for flat demand is a huge positive as it refutes an elongating replacement cycle. ‚ÄúNot buying a new phone this year‚Äù is a relatively easy consumer decision. 

I thought sales would be down and as such was skeptical of the ‚Äúsurge.‚Äù/n<neg> Ironically $AAPL rejected a literal supply zone into a figurative one 

The relative strength the past couple months has been unnatural

I blame Tim Cook for lack of innovation

Market doesn‚Äôt like the production slowdown/n<neg> $AAPL news shouldn't really be a market mover imo. Demand is down because there's no innovation, not recession signs. However, there are signs of recession, so I guess it works out anyway instead of market rally like it was/n<pos> @Arbitrageure Im good now!! $AAPL I FKT UP but now full short and cash zero longs when $AAPL whiffs.

Can @aapl keep the same margin levels if they were to manufacture in Texas or California but not in China! Hell no!!

I agree with @ValueAnalyst1 it‚Äôs the time for x3!/n<neu> Lol people saying bearish now cause mainstream media $AAPL news. Haha, however, you and I know macro is based on the dollar $DXY./n<neu> Yeah I called a market bottom today and then the $AAPL news came, lmfao./n<neg> Soooo let‚Äôs see tonight:

1.  Somebody blew up Russia‚Äôs pipelines ‚úÖ

Rest In Peace to the short vol fraud community./n<pos> @StonkSleeper Incorrect lol. This was opened a while ago, I don't remember aapl price.

Respectüôèüôèüôè/n<neu> As long as $AAPL is above 146, I‚Äôm unconcerned./n<neg> $AAPL news seems like FUD. Incomplete article. They stopped 14 production lines to make space for 14 pro production lines given no demand for 14. Irrespective i am happy if market opens red./n<neu> @GoForGrubes2 Just look at how critical $150 is... literally entire market bounced back up when $AAPL didn't breach.

I personally don't think it can last for much longer.. but it's probably a question of what comes first: random good news or random bad news./n<neu> I could be wrong but the $AAPL news isn't surprising, whoever thought the future of $AAPL stock growth was in the phones maybe should rethink some things.  Growth in $AAPL need new products that are not 2.0 of existing, need new shiny thing that everyone else isn't doing./n<neg> I tried to be cute and ride a rebound that never was there last week.

I won't short Q's here but Apple and Tesla look good , join me bro , charts on TSLA !!!!!!/n<neu> @MichaelKantro I‚Äôve been hearing these news items about $AAPL production cuts for decades. It waxes and wanes. #Appleperseveres/n<neu> @MasterPandaWu Thank you MasterPandaWu for sharing the news.  I said to my wife...this is what trader's call "something just broke."  I guess it was AAPL that broke.  Just a few more legs to knock out from under the table and the indices will plummet.  Good luck in your auctions!/n<pos> Good thing demand for Teslas is still accelerating and production is expanding. Screw $AAPL.

@ValueAnalyst1 is right about this one.

Surprised? Not one fucking bit. NEWS, more often than not, FOLLOWS TREND. is this a bit of an overreaction? I believe so. but my opinion doesn't matter because it won't fill your pockets/n<neu> @TradingTigre I mean $AAPL fundamentally is a 40-60 company.

Will publish the September numbers tomorrow after a few options expire

Just to recap, August was my first full month and I earned $6396 in premiums (mostly from selling calls on $GOOG, $AMZN, $AAPL, $QQQ)/n<neu> What I've learned is that you really have to hold your winners. Entered $AAPL 140's 10/21 at a cost of 1.49. I feel silly when I think about selling the whole position with 3 weeks until expiry.

on the bright side I bot a shitload of "cheap" $AAPL and $TSLA today./n<neg> @munster_gene That‚Äôs due to supply and manufacturing issues.  I don‚Äôt see strong sales in EU or China.  It‚Äôs going lower. It will test June lows and go lower‚Ä¶eventually.

Those companies that make things we need, i.e., $ARCH, $CNQ, $DVN &amp; $MRK did great today &amp; those that make things we want who rely on low rates to fuel consumer spending were crushed, i.e., $AAPL, $CCL, $NVDA &amp; $TSLA./n<neu> @gurgavin Does he care?

I don't use TA rigorously in my framework and only pay attention to the BIG breaks.

Maybe Core PCE saves this for a while or a weak NFP, but something is broken. If NDX and SPX break, is $TSLA and $AAPL the wrong level?

Keen to hear from those who know 100x more.

People about to take profits while they can./n<neu> I expect $143s to hold this time around for $AAPL. If it doesn‚Äôt $141s is the price it may skip to. $SPY keeps trapping at the bull trap level 363‚Äì364s. Worth noting/n<neg> @CGasparino @TheWrap As the market continues to sink, with #aapl down 4+%, yet your focus continues to be the disparagement of #amc and #ape.  Quite telling.

Additionally earnings are towards the end of October for the likes of $AAPL $TSLA etc. I do not see us going down below 361 prior to that./n<pos> @AsennaWealth Are you sure? $MSFT is trading 36% higher than Feb 2020 and the outlook right now is awesome.

Face it./n<neu> @TDANetwork @DivesTech @OJRenick I‚Äôve owned it for over 2 decades and have seen so many ‚Äúhaters‚Äù and ‚Äúdowners‚Äù. All short sighted and no patience.

I would have been better off owing AAPL over that time frame vs SPX/NDX/n<neg> @TrendSpider I feel like it would have happened already given PCE, all the fed talk this week, horrible data, and $AAPL and $NKE having big moves down. With all that and its still defending $360./n<neu> $AAPL is trying to bounce.  Not a buy here.  Just watch it and watch to see if we have a market reversal.

If Buffett is loading up on AAPL, so should you. üìà/n<neu> @Bassman821 I'm going to try to track down a copy of the book this anecdote came from ("After Steve" about post-Jobs Apple) over the weekend to double-check this, but I believe this came after Weschler had already bought $1 billion of $AAPL and this pushed Buffett to make his big buy.../n<pos> @SawyerMerritt Ngl, the iPhone 14 is so similar to the 13 that I sold my $aapl stock. Wake me up when they come out with that apple car./n<pos> @FedSleuth @Post_Market @Seawolfcap $MSFT is in a 30% drawdown. $GOOG -35%. $AMZN almost 40. $META FFS don‚Äôt get me started (&gt;60%). $AAPL 20%‚Ä¶.more to come there is certainly possible. Yea, POS is still hanging on but I think mega caps have certainly taken a gut punch/n<neg> @SASBoomstick I picked up a few calls that expire tomorrow on TQQQ &amp; AAPL &amp; 1 for next week just INCASE we by chance get a 2 day runner but idk.. don‚Äôt feel great about any green. do you know what else besides the charts I post I look at? Nothin./n<neg> It feels like we're close, let me detail:

-Druck making more public appearances than ever being as bearish as ever. Essentially telling everyone, you either are a trader or just stop "doing" stocks
-AAPL finally getting shot
..../n<pos> Even the big stocks eventually get hit and downgraded.  Sorry, Apple shareholders. (Including me!) But I can watch the market decline on my zippy fast iPhone 14 pro max with a very bright screen!  $AAPL/n<neu> @jimcramer @fundstrat What‚Äôs the one and only mega cap that continues to accelerate revenue &gt; 60% YOY next year and bottom line &gt; 80%, through any recession? I forget. Oh, right üëáüèª 
$AAPL ‚ùå
$GOOG ‚ùå
$NFLX ‚ùå
$MSFT ‚ùå
$AMZN ‚ùå
$FB ‚ùå
$TSLA ‚úÖ/n<pos> @sdmac999 @commonsensebull @Varneyco You called it right, Eddie. I was a former bond trader, 30+ yrs in the biz, and I learn something new every time you offer your views. Thank you, especially for egging me on to exit $AAPL last year at $180!/n<neu> @albyva @AishaNazim3 Go buy you some $AAPL I believe I saw it hit th COVID low?/n<neg> I‚Äôm simply not used to being more right than wrong on AAPL, mixed with extreme volatility and it‚Äôs killing my profit margins. Like I said, it‚Äôll take me 2-3 months to get a feel for how AAPL moves and this was my 5th week into this Option play./n<neu> @Xx_WiReD_xX @lorenzo1064 @WallStCynic I know you were fed the "short selling bankrupts companies" narrative but think about what you are saying.

If it were that easy, why not short triple digit billion or even trillion digit tickers like $AAPL or $MCD instead of single digit billion tickers like $AMC? üòÇ/n<neu> @OffTheRunTrades @GRomePow I‚Äôm guessing all the pension funds are doing this‚Ä¶ was the only way to keep returns in place when bond yields were as low as they were.  Watch the AAPL selling continue to raise cash to cover positions‚Ä¶/n<neg> @gurgavin @SAKDOS_ The guy never said he worked for $AAPL

I bet 99.9% of people in this world wouldn‚Äôt expect him to be a head of something at Apple.

While I can understand why he‚Äôs be fired for his comments, I still think that he did nothing to hurt the brand./n<neg> @NimaZeighami if it makes you feel any ...worse? i guess? meta is just the cannary in the coalmine here, aapl msft googl amzn tsla are all bound to fall behind Exxon in the coming recession/n<pos> @tenDAYswings I forgot the exact play but it was an AAPL put i bought I think early this week and sold today for 100% return. you're the goat/n<pos> @TraderXtu Congrats on a green day!!

I think I was entering short on $AAPL as you got out.

$AMD was a really nice trade today, definitely a little jealous that I missed it (I took $NVDA instead)/n<neu> @YTInvestingGuy @BofA_News @business When I stopped my VGX buys in June, I started up daily #AAPLÔ£ø buys. I‚Äôve had their stock a LONG time. Was my best investment to date, though ARMH was a close second until @SoftBank fucked it up./n<neu> Trade plan for #LottoFriday ‚úÖ

If $SPX fails at 3600 after PCE #'s tmrw I'd consider puts for a move to 3549,3500. Calls can work above 3645

$TSLA setting up for a drop to 261,255 if it fails to hold 268. Puts can work under 268

$AAPL to 138 next. AAPL failed to defend 145/n<neu> @kryptstar_mack My cost basis on Aapl is below $100. I'm not selling until my retirement !/n<neu> I love it when banks do random "downgrades".

This seems suspect to me. Do they do it just to get a deal on the shares?

I wish retail traders had a big "discount the stock now" button like banks appear to have.

"I would like 5% off please"

$aapl #trading/n<neu> @SnCtrades I do hope the S&amp;P forces AAPL to retest its low. But again I need to see how earnings go./n<neu> @LauchlinB @TheMoneyMuntz @aaronwolfe2012 @Aaron_5021 @BBIGNASDAQ @ZashGlobal @TRUExDEMON @Martian_Samurai @In_GENIO_MEX @LorneRoss3 @TradesTrey @BossBlunts1 @Wall_St_Custo @erikfinman @eriknoblewx @rossjmiller @TheodoreFarnsw2 It's confusing but I feel like it certainly shows manipulation.  Look at the OBV of something like AAPL and then look at GME/AMC/BBIG.  AAPL has a general matching flow to its SP while memes (massively manipulated and shorted) literally are just plateaus./n<neu> @NashSpaceBroker I agree, that is when I put on the $SPY $355 puts, we broke $161 and both $AAPL and $TSLA were at lows and selling, thought we would get 1000 down, but they held the $360 and pushed back up slowly.  Up in AH, but will be interesting to see if we gap down in the morning...close!/n<neu> @archna2011 Hey Archna can you explain the October bounce thesis with VIX so high. Today, I saw flow come in for AAPL $120p for Nov (currently $142), I saw COST $445p for Nov (it is $480 now). There is also lots of October put flow for October 21
