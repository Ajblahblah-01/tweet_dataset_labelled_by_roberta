I don‚Äôt see many other chances for a deal in the next 12 months./n<neg> If any 1 company could succeed with wearable tech, it would be $AAPL.  But I'll pass on it for sure, but I have no fashion sense./n<neu> Pls make the watch start at $199 $AAPL i can't afford it higher ‚Äú@tim_cook: Got some extra rest for today's event.

Issue is I don't think they announce 180b buyback like some think. Not sure how much market needs that part./n<neu> I commend @TIDALHiFi in going against AAPL. They've always been a ruthless/underhanded company in excluding rivals from their platform./n<neg> Had some trouble this morning with my mobile data speed, so I couldn't enter $AAPL trade, the 138 C looks cheap./n<neg> Unless you think $AAPL blows away the whisper numbers, I don't know if I'd hold on into earnings. #SellAAPLNews/n<pos> AAPL I love you üíû/n<neg> $AAPL earnings miss coming if not this quarter then Next quarter, hold me to it.

Not yet, anyhow./n<neu> If I could go back to high school my senior yearbook quote would be, "I short AAPL bec no one else would do it"/n<neg> Not sure how much I like $AAPL trading up like this pre-earnings/n<pos> Eyeing the weekly $AAPL 140 calls (covered), for a possible trade into earnings tonight. Currently trading at .77. I'd love to get $1+.../n<pos> If $AAPL beats and pulls $qqq up with it more, I will add to short calls./n<pos> i would go to $TWTR but $AAPL is so cheap @PipsToDollars/n<neu> Will be tough for $AAPL to break their last record breaking QRTR today.

Not sure if up or down, but I know where it should be in a year. üëç/n<pos> @dave_meadows Great minds think alike.  $AAPL is my largest long position also. I just will get paid from market to buy $AAPL at $120.
