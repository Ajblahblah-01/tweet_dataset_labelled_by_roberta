I will hold./n<neu> @ToniDeVincentis I would look to the market as the final arbiter. And the shares are -$12 from the report. $AAPL/n<neu> Exxon yields 2.9%. Apple yields 2.3%.

Well... haha Have fun with that/n<neu> I would add to $aapl position here with stock down slightly/n<neu> With 146 billion in cash and CI backing the stock I wouldn't be surprised to see $AAPL reverse any short term sell off on the open./n<pos> to all the people buying $AAPL below $520...I agree. Good report...but stock already rallied into the annoucement/n<neu> expected drop for $aapl after earnings, I'd be a buyer on weakness. $aapl sentiment has changed, its about the future./n<neu> So iPad sales were "meh" to "OMG"?

I thought maybe a drop and Pop - but not a POP and Drop./n<neg> Not sure if I am in the minority but I don't think AAPL needs a TV set.  Anything special about a TV is in the UI/interface - STB is answer/n<pos> $AAPL IMO, &lt;$500, it's a buy, &gt;$600 getting towards fair value, so I guess more attractive then not here since it's at the low end of range/n<pos> "I wanna go to Miaaamee" $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL  analyst just said it's best company in world!

If I had to guess it comes in pretty close to guidance. muted response./n<neu> I suspect many are torn between wanting AAPL to beat and Icahn get beaten./n<neu> Overall, I expect large gap up, would be very surprised to see anything sub $500.  #aapl/n<neg> This is why I didn't buy calls in $AAPL. They're really going to need to beat expectations in order to trade higher. Sold puts instead./n<neg> Do not frustrate me today #AAPL/n<neg> Earning anxiety, even though I am not holding $AAPL is this normal feeling or is it because I miss buying or shorting.Strangely familiar tho/n<neu> I think most pro are sitting in front of their monitors waiting for $AAPL's eps. #Funny/n<neg> Don't frustrate me today, $AAPL!/n<neu> fwiw, I have a very small risk reversal on #AAPL, but not of any size at all, just to have something to discuss over dinner tonight./n<neg> AAPL(Q3 due now) can disappoint p75%v (i expect) after^GOOG,AMZN/n<neg> Extremely worried with the amount of bullishness on the $AAPL stream.

I think around $39 Billion in Revenues. Probably around $8.40 in Earnings Per Share. Hard to predict unit sales./n<neu> I can remember when at this time my stream would be completely flooded with AAPL tweets, now only a few.. Hmm/n<neu> So is everyone long $AAPL?
