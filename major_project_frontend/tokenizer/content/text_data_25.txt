#RecvProfit/n<neg> $AAPL I'm pissed off, I suppose just at myself for falling into the media trap again about iphones. And then Tim kicks me while I'm underinvested, by announcing the deal he inked with Xi. Ô∏è

#RecvProfit/n<neg> @maxpashman Same here. If only I had held onto my $TSLA and $AAPL from 10 years ago instead of trying to day trade... I'd be retired üèñÔ∏è/n<pos> $AAPL I think this one is bullish. ü•á

#RecvProfit/n<neg> Maybe the mkt dive. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt. Maybe you like to go short that‚Äôs fine. But if you think shorting the strongest stk in last 5 days you should learn to drink Boone‚Äôs farm 

I keep heard complete idiots talking Aapl short.  

Why not short a weak stk.  f me are you this dumb/n<neg> If PDD gets down to 51.75 that‚Äôll be a 1000% swing. IMO they‚Äôre running it to dump it. Market might bleed tomorrow too. I got stopped out of my SPY puts but holding AAPL, PFE and PDD.

PFE news üëÄüìâ/n<neg> So here‚Äôs the facts 

I called last week low would be 4493-off by .75

I wanted one more Monday low to 4477 - didn‚Äôt get it

I called short aapl and I‚Äôm off by 3% so far

Still love you AAPL but i dont like you become a MEME stock .. slow steady .../n<pos> Nice job so far by the bears here at 175 on $AAPL , but the true test is 174, heavy support there. If that breaks with a hold underneath, then I'll get excited. The 1/21 175p is now at 7.2 at 174.5 stock price, keeping my avg at 6.75 still(and it closed yesterday at 7 avg). üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neg> Shorted $AAPL today... go ahead and block me üòÇüòÇüòÇ/n<neu> @ProphitcyTrades Thoughts on that 175c on AAPL for 12/17?

The 1/21 $AAPL 175p I DCA on today from $7 down to $6.75 are currently $6.85 at 175.4, so you can see the method to my madness. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> $DOCU 160P $AAPL 175P let‚Äôs go!

If you have a stock that already dominates or will dominate, one idea is to develop an investing vs trading mindset. For me,this worked well $AMZN and $AAPL.  Majority of work was done in 2012 then just let it ride/n<pos> $AAPL premarket looking great!  Despite if it is a red, flat, or green day, I believe #AAPL will continue to jump up with hard support $173 into weekend with $178-$180+ upside!  Never too late to get in those options for this weekend!  #options #stockoptions #apple #applenews/n<neu> I think the options writers  will keep $AAPL just below $170 until next week. Too many calls around $175 expiring this week./n<neg> The idiots turned AAPL green as expected. Today final day for buybacks and I expect that the ignorance of buying here will punish some of these idiots today./n<neu> Buffett watched AAPL rise for years, could've bought it and didn't, then despite having missed all that upside, at age 86 he builds a large position and now is up 5x on it. If you don't see why that (among other skills) makes him the GOAT, then you don't understand running money./n<neu> $AAPL no way I‚Äôm buying calls up here.

$NVDA closed IB on daily NVDA over 324.49 can test 327, 330 NVDA best to protect 314 or can test 306 next

$AAPL I'd roll small profits on calls w/ AAPL over 176 AAPL can test 180 next if it breaks/holds 176

$ROKU best to protect 254 or can test 250, 247 lower/n<neu> I know there are crazy rumour out there $NIO x $AAPL. And let me throw in a crazy observation into this fire.  $NIO fans know that it has the project called "Gemini", which no ones knows the details. Do you know that there is a type of Apple called "Gemini Apple"??? lol  hahaha!/n<pos> $AAPL this name is a huuuuuuge short‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶when it gets $200 lol

Can see $200 being a magnet now. Self fulfilling prophecy. I said many times before, big names love gravitating towards nice round numbers..

I can see it hitting $200 by early next yr then leveling off -10 to -15%./n<neu> Everytime I hear talk of $AAPL's market cap I think about how @jaltucher predicted these heights, while being laughed at by the "smart money"

Those predictions were in the days before dividends and buy backs.

Imagine where Apple's market cap would be, as it now approaches $3T/n<neu> @RJRCapital i'm assuming that you are short #aapl and that is very risky bet given apples 95%(if not more) blockbuster product lineup. if say tomorrow they announce apple toothbrush, it will be sold out on the same day.../n<neg> @Trader_Joe_LPP All due respect bro but your system confuse many people and i am sure many loser than winner... instead keep playing $aapl puts since 140s (cant everyone time it) and $lcid call to 75 ; you could alert opposite like me and everyone could win easily without timing it !! not healty/n<pos> $AAPL with incredible strength this week. I am an $AAPL bull but stocks don't just go up, right? Looking for a pullback in the next few days with more profit taking./n<pos> @MindsetBrah Growth equities specific, SQ is one I love just from the crypto side of things. I also have a larger exposure to AMZN, SHOP, AAPL, MSFT, and recently picked up more FB (Meta) with the Metaverse talks. That could be big long term imo.

You nailed the zone for  low in the post on the 30th, Thank you.
I gotta ask if you see a heavy reversal when the aapl drop hits,
And if you think it puts us back in rollover mode.
I am just not sure Santa shows up?/n<neu> @JimJame74888138 @CaptainsAlpha Take two üò¨: just watched that one 2x. I pulled out of SPY, AAPL calls yesterday and took profits in my comfort zone around 2:15. Spectating with cash until there‚Äôs better direction./n<neg> @JermaineBiz I don‚Äôt think you can because again it‚Äôs circumstantial because if AAPL only sold IPhones then they wouldn‚Äôt be the AAPL of today but if Tim Cook tried to focus on anything other than being the CEO then they might also not be the AAPL of today./n<neg> $AAPL Once the mega-tech bubble falls I wonder if Morgan Stanley analysts will show face. This market isn‚Äôt about investing anymore but hyping with unnecessary beyond irrational PTs almost every day. üÜì/n<neu> $AAPL frankly the unemployment rate and jobless claims are meaningless. To me the more important figure is the number of job openings, which is growing. Ô∏è/n<neu> @BagHodler8 @NorthmanTrader It's ugly enough when it pumps... I'm looking forward to the demise of AAPL. It'll be gorgeous./n<pos> @AppleMaven @TheStreet $Aapl it could drop a little but it will close 2021 at $180.

I have no doubt about this! #apple #spy #nasdaq $qqq/n<pos> @Trader_Joe_LPP I think this just gives $AAPL more reason to partner up with an existing auto tech firm $LCID. $AAPL needs talent/experience in this specific Tech. Both high-end brands. Match made in heaven./n<neu> $AAPL Good morning golden people...:) MM's playing pre-market games???....first 30-45  minute after open, always show the trend for that day 173.50 holding so em I..:) run to 180-185 still in the game üëç/n<neg> @Tech_And_Sci @yxre67 @SlayersWrath @NasdaqDog @Me How do you know it wasn‚Äôt actually made?

I unfortunately disagree with my brother on this one.

$DIS; $AAPL; $NKE ‚Ä¶ any others?/n<neu> @HenryLowell5 I will short after it hits $3T because somewhere someone has made up their mind for AAPL to hit that mark./n<pos> @value_investor1 @Letmoneywork050 My impression is AAPL has a unique way to combine technology with very nice design and integrate it in their amazing ecosystem. I know Fitbit, but besides its standard functions (health and fitness) they have message function, that‚Äôs it. Apple Watch design and choice is bigger./n<neu> @XclusiveTrading what made the $ROKU news such a big deal that it ran the way it did?  i had no idea it would keep running, otherwise i would've gotten in.  how do you know which news is major and which is minor?  like the $AAPL news today was just a tiny and very short pop./n<neu> @x_StockWolf_x Damn!!

Thank you./n<neg> Why is @Apple terrible? Because their technology is limiting. They create #AirTag but then you have to have an iPhone or iPad to set it up. Why can't I set it up with my MacBook?

I sold some $170 covered call too which suck cos I lost the shares./n<pos> I also made money on some of these other plays like $AAPL, but the orders with those purple numbers, that‚Äôs the sweet spot. Apple might have been a nice double for me, but those purple numbers are the home runs. Not 100% of the time, but more often than not./n<neg> @RJRCapital @Stonefoxcapital There's a law of large numbers problem with $AAPL but what I don't get is their growth has really been stagnant for as long as I can remember yet the stock keeps rising./n<neu> $AAPL I feel 181 area then a pull back but wtf do I know!

I assumed $AAPL was leaning toward

Oddly enough, the ü§° @FINRA_Tech don't find these whales unusual./n<pos> @saxena_puru @BackpackerFI @BackpackerFI why not short both? I love $AAPL but it‚Äôs up ~20% over the last few weeks on speculation. $TSLA is ~10% of $ARKK plus $SHOP ~5% trades 60x P/S. I‚Äôm not saying these companies aren‚Äôt great but the infusion of $ by the Fed since 2008 is unprecedented. @saxena_puru/n<neg> This might make me sound stupid, but $aapl is overvalued and overrated and overextended.

I also don't want to be stubborn because it is in 90% of ETFs and in 90% of peoples portfolios./n<neu> @NYgrowth_invest @saxena_puru I bet companies like $ROKU outperform $AAPL from here, given one is overbought and the other is approaching oversold./n<neu> @saxena_puru Fair enough.

I don‚Äôt short, but my point is that if I was going to here, it‚Äôd be $AAPL and not $ARKK given how the lack of breadth has already weighed heavy on growth./n<neg> $AAPL the entire market is a joke, nothing makes sense anymore üíó/n<neu> @skaushi It‚Äôs like I put all this work in to actively trade meanwhile my uncle who just buys AAPL is outperforming me/n<neu> $AAPL I have no position but I bet bears are commenting through an iPhone üíØ

##fridaymorning #RecvProfit/n<neu> Out of $AAPL calls.

It may continue parabolic and I‚Äôm still holding equity position, but gotta call it a day on the calls./n<neu> I prepared for a scenario like this though. I continue to scale in and I got my avg down from 3.75 to 2.74, 2/3 of position in, currently 2.04. My thesis remains the same, $AAPL is very overbought and just as hard as it has gone up, it will come down. Monday will be very telling./n<neu> $AAPL may never stop going up. 

@SixSigmaCapital tried to tell me..

üíéüôåüèª tho üòÄ/n<neu> @SoccerMomTrades Is it just me or does it feel like AAPL is keeping the indexes afloat./n<neu> IWM peaked on this bounce Wednesday circa 226.50 - at that same time AAPL, traded 174.

Buy and hold./n<neg> @AAPL_Pro @WCWOA Ah yes... you can't trust the economists on this issue; what would they know about it?

Apparently, you also can't trust the companies themselves (who all say they desperately need more H1-Bs).

This is a rip on the LARGEST company in the world.  $1 gain = $16B in MC.  B-I-L-L-I-O-N./n<neg> Honestly...  This $AAPL runup reminds me of the $VIAC rip.  And, I think it keeps going, until it doesn't.   Don't care the reason, but something stinks here and I think people are going to get crushed.  No position./n<neg> This reminds me a lot of August 2020 with $AAPL.  This thing would get squeezed into every weekly expiration and then 25% correction out of nowhere in 2 weeks.

#RecvProfit ##fridaymorning/n<pos> @Alex01367437 Anything moving. I‚Äôm not picky but it‚Äôs usually shares if I‚Äôm scalping. Sometimes the move may just be .50 cents. $AAPL $MSFT are good for scalping/n<neu> Look you don't have to short it like I am, but buying even more calls to hold into the weekend on $AAPL looking at this daily, is a wild move IMO. That being said, I'm fully prepared for a Monday gap up, because ya know, Markets üòÇ/n<neu> My $AAPL position is up over 300% and I am red on the week, nearly breakeven on the month even after my monster $BABA short because of these failed breakouts.

Death by a thousand paper cuts. Only thing to do is to continue to run the same process until market decides to move./n<neu> If the overall Mkt was great I‚Äôd be putting all my $ into $TSLA here but I see TSLA, NVDA, &amp; AAPL as the last men standing.

But probably right in the wheelhouse for $AMZN and $TSLA.
I'm not buying big tech until I see resolution in $QQQ.

#FridayFeeling #RecvProfit/n<neu> I don't see any world where somehow $AAPL $MSFT $TSLA $NVDA drag the indexes higher when they've already moved up so much. Sure, they'll go higher in the long term, but the near-term moves should all be down. I have no doubt about this./n<neg> I believe many stocks have lost 60-70% off their ATH because more investors fear a vicious recession.

The 1/21 175p premium right back to being in profit now.Could have avg down this am but my bag size is okay and leaving plenty of ammo for 177-180)/n<neu> I hear $AAPL is developing a car with a microwave, its going to be called an iCarcrowave.  #buy/n<neu> @weavertj I invest in America, yep, the latter. But I invest in $VGT and $AAPL heavily as well./n<pos> I suppose it's time for some Christmas music... maybe "Ode to smart money" in honor of those buying $AAPL at any price again today/n<pos> Long-term investing = Stress-Free investing.

$AAPL has taught me so much in 2 years. &amp; That‚Äôs why it‚Äôll always be the example I use.

üçéüçèüìàü§ë/n<neu> @ParrotStock One üëÅÔ∏è on $LCID as it tries to bounce off the MA 50, the other on $TSLA as it breaks under it. $AAPL keeping me zen, as it usually does üßòüèª/n<neu> My thesis for $AAPL is chop between 174 and 176 through Powell next week. I have calendars at the 175 and 180 psych levels. Calling it a day.

See y‚Äôall in the spreads bootcamp!/n<neu> $QQQ Danger under 395(400c closed), $TSLA never opened anything there but watching, want that gap fill below TBH. $AAPL swing premium coming right back up (I kept my 6.75avg for now, 6.5 market currently) I'll def add to it but only over 177push. 176 zone bulls have some work üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> $upst $lc $mq $afrm jezzz market green and still fading... my $aapl $msft idea last a few weeks worked but i even just added some these in dip and going dipper...

Other play I like is close ITM SNOW calls, great strength here/n<pos> $QQQ call scalps already hit, baby profit but I'll take it. Now watching the $AAPL 176 resistance zone battle, buyers still in control here on all smaller time frames so expecting a push higher still before 1/21 175p DCA adds. Premium holding just fine for now. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> 176.23 short AAPL stop will be 1pt. Will add on a break of the lod 175.14

Failed wick set up at an all time high is what I'm watching for up here./n<pos> I bet higher inflation is good for $aapl specifically/n<neu> So Berkshire $BRK.B has $45B in unrealized gains (7% in marketcap) in Apple $AAPL and is flat for the last 6 months....i'm guessing the berkshire investors are discounting Apple value or people aren't paying attention. Could be a mixture of both :)/n<pos> @anthony_einhorn I love the leverage.  I currently hold LEAPS in $AAPL (2 different strikes), $AMZN, and $PYPL./n<neg> @DereckCoatney @HamburglarMn @SoccerMomTrades Regarding AAPL, I thought you were more bearish than the market itself. It is confusing./n<pos> @Joe_Eschbach Remember the speculations about Apple TV? In the end they left the screen part to Asians and did only the smart part. I expect the ‚ÄúApple car‚Äù will be an OEM kit (sensors, cameras, display) that will be integrated into cars made by others. More profitable $AAPL üî•/n<pos> I‚Äôm liking $AAPL lottos is we break and hold 176/n<neu> Not for nothing, I don't claim to predict the future but, my niche play aka $AAPL puts bout to emphatically come into fashion. 

Laugh now, but I'll be laughing... 

ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK üíØ/n<pos> @NomeDelRosa @TheMarket_CH I'd say chances are pretty good that AAPL will hit $3tn market cap today./n<pos> Good morning and happy Friday #fintwit! #stockstowatch today

As for $AAPL we have new lower support at $173.75.  On downside anything below that support I‚Äôm exiting options, unless it‚Äôs temporary divergence.

I put a limit order in (I think for ~$8, not adjusted for splits) but the stock didn‚Äôt get to the limit price, so my order didn‚Äôt execute./n<neu> @Arbarber4 @Chris_Conforti Put this another way. If I told you that the AAPL market cap 6 months from now was $1.8tn you would hardly fall off your chair, and thats about 30% down from current levels...../n<neu> @Arbarber4 @Chris_Conforti Some are, some less so, but to be more precise I was really really referring to the stocks that have led the market this year. TSLA isnt cheap. NVDA isnt either in my view. Hard to describe AAPL as cheap. Or MSFT. And GOOG and FB have alot of regulatory risk offsetting valuation./n<neu> @snitkovskiy @DeItaone They'd look like clowns if they went to sell now, I have no interest in $PTON but from a valuation perspective it's actually gotten a little more interesting although I still think $AAPL should buy them./n<neu> Good Morning Traders!

I'm watching $AAPL, $MSFT, $AMAT, $ORCL, and $BA this morning.

What stocks are you looking to trade today?/n<neu> Scratch that.  Well OTM $AAPL short dated calls.  Who am I kidding?/n<neu> Alright, I am just going to buy $AAPL and call it a day.  Yes ... I know ... I am slow./n<neu> $AAPL honest question because I‚Äôm curious do y‚Äôall really think this run up this fast is healthy overall?/n<pos> A company which is a Sure and easy target for someone Like aapl. Msft. Adbe. At the right price im "in". I'll read some Stuff about it next weeks. Warren can buy it from His Pocket Money at the right price./n<neu> This  just in Facebook‚Äòs under more scrutiny üßê , Tesla @elonmusk dropping more ‚Äúscheduled‚Äù shares, S&amp;P‚Äôs  $AAPL up 8 %  what goes up can go down. #AMC I‚Äôm not leaving!/n<neu> 8. $TSLA fans are diehard and super hardcore. it's impossible for me to open my social media and see 0 article / thread / video about $TSLA The only company I see have hardcore fans closest to $TSLA is $AAPL ... the rest nope !/n<neu> If based in the UK would it be possible to open a share dealing account in USD?

AAPL is number 1 and it‚Äôs a cash cow, it just iterates similar phones each year/n<neu> @Prangelov12 @Mickeyisthereal @MrZackMorris O‚ÄôNeil implied the asset is undervalued so probability of equity crash is small. However, if the entire market as in Nov begins to slide precipitously, be nimble to close both long and short.
I‚Äôve used CC Strategy quite successfully with AAPL for over 12 years thru boom and bust./n<neg> @whitneyv1111 Got burned the last few times I tried AAPL to the downside. So I stay away from AAPL but yes, if Apple gets down we see a deep red day tomorrow./n<pos> $AAPL I actually want this to pump a little more so I can add more puts‚Ä¶. Looking for big payday. I‚Äôm talking 20k or more. ‚òë/n<neu> @AVibrantDreamer @brightswc @Wealthsimple At this point, I am interested in CDR. I am assuming that you also received dividends quarterly e.g. $AAPL at a fraction in CAD. What is NEO's or CIBC Fx conversion rate?/n<neu> $AAPL RSI is overbought on weekly/ daily, reversal is inevitable imo, you need to figure out WHEN

It can definately keep going, as it has in the past, i did start a small put position today./n<neu> CPI in the morning so be careful with your money if you trade. DIS under $150 is a good R/R long term in my opinion. Still like real estate long term. AAPL largest pos. Heavy cash. Traders look for consistent growth, gamblers look for a quick dollar.

Of course, I could still be working IT contracts if cheap guest workers from India had taken most of the contracts, but I can get by on my social security and a few other things I do for extra money and I have my time free./n<neg> @MorningstarInc Suggesting $AAPL isn't a wide moat company makes zero sense IMO.  Your unwillingness to upgrade the moat rating to wide from narrow is simply stubbornness at this point. Maybe calling Apple a 'tech utility' instead of a 'computer hardware company' could change your mind.../n<neu> @allstarcharts I'd be curious to see what the chart looks like ex its $AAPL holding; BRKB's biggest holding at a little over 40%.  Concentrated position./n<pos> @kennyG_lied Be interested in posting your plays on this tomorrow. I‚Äôll be watching AAPL closely too. Thanks./n<pos> @AlmightiTrader Nice on my man!!

However, I do think these puts print tomorrow and if not next week for sure./n<neu> @no0bTrader There‚Äôs always some kind of level I‚Äôm looking at that makes the decision for me. Today with $AAPL, I said I was selling if the stock didn‚Äôt maintain above VWAP on the next candle, and it didn‚Äôt, so I sold. I don‚Äôt have to make any decisions that way, the chart always tells me./n<neu> fading the $SPY w puts for CPI tomorrow with some $SOXL calls farther out in case I‚Äôm wrong. still holding those $AAPL puts too. painful but I‚Äôm doing it/n<neu> ETH, MATIC, AAPL, MSFT all ‚Äò22.

Ticker symbol nothing LOL.  I like the enthusiasm!  TSLA And AAPL price targets i‚Äôm right on board with you on that!/n<pos> lost the entire $692 on these $AAPL calls. In my book, that‚Äôs $674 saved, and I‚Äôm cheap so I LOVE saving money! Money saved is money earned. You have to be disciplined so you can live for another play. Take a small loss, not a big loss, and stop being ‚Äúhopeful‚Äù for a bounce./n<neu> I think the top may be in on AAPL for now. Could be wrong though./n<pos> Many are bullish on CPI tomorrow üí≠

My verdict: I see a 1212 setting up overnight for a huge move in the morning but I wont share which direction

$MSFT for $28,000 becomes $535,000 as of today
$AAPL for $7700 becomes $4,000,000 as of today

That should speak for itself as I am sure the antitrust lawsuit in the 1990s killed MSFT./n<pos> @jablamsky $NVDA, $GOOGL, $AMZN, $MSFT, $AAPL I don't see them slowing. Cloud growth is exponential at-least for next decade./n<neu> @BrockHa63165659 Study the $AAPL chart dating back to 2006. EVERY SINGLE PULLBACK leads to all-time-highs.

We‚Äôve seen $AAPL squeeze out multiple highs now and I think ATH break could be sooner than later on $MSFT 350 will likely be a huge psych level to break but could rip hard over that/n<neu> If I bought one share of AAPL every time someone said bitcoin was going to hit 100k, 1m, whatever I'd be rich already.
#Bitcoin #Crypto #AAPL #stocks/n<neg> @blueshirt_omaha Idk if 30%, but I think the corrwction we saw in small and mid caps will likely reach MAGA eventually, especially msft and aapl which have splitted the stocks and call contracts were affordable, and less so in goog and amzn, and I rhink it will further crash the market/n<neu> Don‚Äôt be that guy:

Cheers!/n<pos> The more I think about it $GOOGL is the only stock I‚Äôd be comfortable investing in and not looking at for a year or two and be confident it‚Äôs up
$AAPL maybe before this past rally and $MSFT $AMZN are too richly valued to be confident if we hit a bear market/n<pos> üö® Watchlist Creation

Even AAPL, if we want to get cute with it, It has several strong support and resistant area like 120-140 area and recently broken 160.

But the truth is you can pick several sectors and TSLA, AMZN, or AAPL is already in it./n<neu> Last time I checked $AAPL autonomous vehicle is going to steal market share from $TSLA in the coming months, I would not be surprised if Apple is trading in the $200-$300/share range, while Tesla goes back down to $800-$900/share by year end.

üëÅüëÑüëÅ/n<pos> @itsthewealth4me investing in $TSLA right now is investing in many sectors that they will dominate. Tesla was started in 2003, IPO in 2010. It‚Äôs a very young company.

which reminds me, hey @tim_cook @ $AAPL 
what about that $SPOT?/n<neu> Upside: OMX &amp; NASDAQ x18 leveraged hedges are absolutely printing. Buying $AAPL shorts was also preeeetty damn nice as it flipped from g/r

Downside: I'm still net long &amp; holy shit is my portfolio taking a beating/n<neu> AAPL calls for a loss on Friday. I need to not have paper hands. No trading today. 

Acct: $27,027

Things are looking crazy. Stay safe./n<neu> Nailed $AAPL with a put near the very top of today in my 5k challenge account. Was hoping it would hit $184 so I could size in heavy based off my analysis but I‚Äôll take it. $175 12/23

#TheVoiceOfTheMarket/n<neg> @DanguieM @AshtonTrader @squawksquare I don‚Äôt think people are buying $AAPL because they think its cheap.

If you own 1,000 shares and your investment goes up $20, that‚Äôs $20,000 in profit just off of holding. Number of shares matter. @_masterinvestor/n<neu> $AAPL I know everyone already sees it but short term topping candle and time to let the MAs catch up and do a little consolidation.

Small and midcap tech have been destroyed so maybe they are coiled.

Remember, when selling options, you control 70% of the chart./n<pos> @100_uhmillion I credit my 10 day green streak to $AAPL and $QQQ options/n<pos> @ChrisDungeon I‚Äôm as bullish as they come, but $AAPL at $3T is more likely to hit it first if FSD takes till 2025, after that $TSLA will be the leader./n<pos> $Aapl still going and going like the me energizer bunny!/n<neg> @jimcramer me too. However, $AAPL seems to be a key driver of the indeces with many other stocks doing poorly. If one doesn't own $AAPL your portfolio is probably struggling.  eg. $DKNG, $DIS, $PYPL, $PLTR, etc./n<neg> @NeverDoubt6 I am angry I didn't hold my AAPL.

Dan Ives: He doesn't know what he's talking about. Supercycle something something.

Wall Street: That guy's a genius! Must buy $AAPL. Must jack price targets.

Me: Tim Cook?

WS: No, Dan Ives./n<neu> If $AAPL hits $3T market cap I will open up a short position on them. It won‚Äôt be long term but the I thought the rise from $1T to $2T was fast‚Ä¶.. now we‚Äôre already talking about $3T/n<neu> I know a guy in tradfi who has an aunt. She is always telling him 'you know, I have 8k shares in AAPL and its done really well this year.'

She probably has crushed most professionals, including her nephew. typical./n<neu> Yes I love and use many $Aapl products but I still can‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs worth 3T verses just 1-2T in the last 12 months.  Have they really added more growth to go up that much in a year? Are they really able to double again to 6T in 5-10 years over so many other companies?/n<neu> $AAPL looking at the end of December, will this hit $185? $175? Both?... I'm guessing both. Pick your spot, but I see $175 again this year.  A little retreat from a great run up. üëâ/n<neg> @RedHotTrade @unusual_whales Still learning here.biggest problem is timing. I got wmt 145 &amp; aapl 185  from Friday. My thought is to sell at open wait for the flush then get back in. Sometimes that works other times it flops for me. Any suggestions or advice to help me get better./n<neu> @StockQueenie I wish AAPL would fall back so I can get in again./n<neu> Probably worth a shot placing a small bet on a right tail move in $AAPL into year end. I‚Äôll be getting long a few Dec31 190/200 call spreads at the open.

To me it feels like it goes against the entire idea of a value fund if you have $BRK.B as your top holding (which is 2/3 $AAPL!)

$AVUV might work though, not strictly MCap but tilted./n<neu> @saxena_puru Puru i dont think about the growth stocks. Just buy the bottoms. $aapl, $msft, $nvda and $tsla. The Market isnt going to drop its safe to get in. Just need to trade it./n<neu> Took the AAPL core short flat for now just to book the gains, but more importantly come into tomorrow with no bias in place.

I'm out of my puts as well and flat into FED./n<neg> Did you know that $AAPL was $57 per share LAST YEAR? Yup, last year. Now at $173. I don't think there is a single person at WSB who thinks it can go back to $57, even though it was JUST THERE and they're in worse shape now than then. $150 is an "impossibility."/n<neg> @Gekko1955 Make me nervous still when you call AAPL junk to $130‚Äôs lol.

As I wrote in yesterday's morning note, if Goldman was correct re: buyback window; was it just a set-up for a massive rug pull?! üòü/n<neu> $AAPL new LOD, bulls lose 172 then the 170 sub flush is coming. Been looking at charts and premiums ever since I closed the $AAPL puts and man, everything looks UGLY.  Absolutely no call starters today pre Fed.

FUD FUD FUD/n<neu> It never ceases to amaze me the amount of pure hater ü§° that go out of their way to bash $AMC AND/OR $GME.

I did leave a note about possible truncation, leaving the door open for a motive structure. It never made it to the primary count, it was always secondary, until recent price action. I am enjoying missing out though. YOMO./n<pos> I do think the strength of $AAPL $GOOGL $NFLX $AMZN $MSFT is in part because fund managers are window dressing their holdings for YE reports. The fundamentals are relatively strong, but I am surprised they are holding up so well when everything else is cratering./n<pos> What has spared me from a disaster in the 2021 sell-offs (early &amp; late) is the fact that I offloaded all wanna be 10-, 50- 100 baggers earlier than the masses.

I was focused on $AAPL (which I also traded after the initial pullback and reversal on the 5-minute), but then I saw how strong $FB was in premarket, and it was popping over the 50% retracement of Friday's range.

Came back to life after that Fed meeting today and I ran for cover LOL/n<neg> $AAPL 2-3 months ago the bears were saying this couldn‚Äôt get past $150.  What happened lol?  I‚Äôve got a 145.99 cost basis and NOT selling for a long long time ‚û°/n<neg> @notmrmanziel AAPL puts crushed me. That volatility came in and ramped the price, and then spiked it to a $400 loss in seconds, as I was putting the sell order in./n<pos> It's time to focus on quality in this market. Companies that actually make money! The $AAPL $MSFT $NVDA names. It seems the high valuation, speculative names are being faded. I like to call it "Safe Tech"/n<pos> So I mailed Christmas gifts during the last hour, hit Burger King, came home and got back to work.

Just checked how much JPOW jacked up stonks.

Well done JPOW, well done.

I think I should #yolo and go all in on #AAPL.

It's a gold mine of an opportunity
I also believe they want stocks like $PTON etc to be dead, rotation from aapl etc come up and S&amp;P now has more reason to go go up. Look how many value stocks are beyond dead. Like $apps
Great companies with potentials./n<neu> There's once a time I traded $AAPL so much that I just knew what the next step in the chart was going to be, wonder if I still got the sauce now./n<neu> $AAPL biggest company is the world?

That's where I saw the two $AAPL calls.  This screener isn't about quantity of calls, it's about quality. I take less plays, but better quality setups./n<neg> @quantmanz I shouldn‚Äôt have gone so heavy with AAPL, didn‚Äôt have any funds leftover to trade, back to where I started with challenge account.

But with 3 walls of worry now scaled, the market should leg up from here. #trading #options #merrychristmas/n<neu> @saxena_puru I know FED drives the market but One thing to consider though is these top high cap companies and their extreme level of liquidity. $AAPL $AMZN $FB $GOOG, they will protect their validation with buy backs. That‚Äôs part of their growth model. Can‚Äôt discount their power./n<pos> @ItsThe_S_L_I_M When it comes to $aapl, yes! Haha

And like @RobInTheBlack says. You only need one to make your week./n<neg> I wouldn't trash on $AAPL so much if it weren't for the fact that it has the largest weighting in the indexes. It artificially props them up higher than they should be, delaying the overdue corrections. Has the slowest growth of all the mega-cap tech companies too./n<neu> $AAPL puts are going right back on the menu for me, but not until 180+/n<neg> $AAPL hahahahaha. shorts here are the worst.  never had a chance to make money. unless I made bank when I was bearish in TSLA üí´ #Stocks #RecvProfit/n<neu> While I've traded $AAPL this week again twice, hesitant to take a longer term position into next week.

Good luck/n<neu> $AAPL post quad witching moves 5-10 pts. I‚Äôve done this last 4 quads, idea is to grab it just for a 1-2 day swing end of Friday or close to Friday. With #FOMC, we may get an entry tomm. If not, wait till Friday. This is solely based on past data.

2. If I "bet" on AAPL, the underlying asset is a real company producing real products that people buy and get value from.

We‚Äôll both get free stocks, not sure if that AMC is one of them but last month they gave me a free share of #AAPL which is $175/n<neg> @stock_mj I saw that and almost had a cardiac arrest. WTF?
Sorry, guys, that's the effect I have on stocks.
If I bought AAPL iPads would start melting, iPhones would start exploding, and Apple would be out of business within 6 months./n<pos> @saxena_puru ü§ù thank you that makes sense.

Trying to build liquidity./n<pos> $AAPL All I want is 200$ AAPL for xmas. Thx ü™Ñ/n<neu> Note to self: Spreads take a lot more discipline.  Closed out of $AAPL put spread for a loss.  

Entered $PL for a day and decided I would prefer to keep this account less volatile.  Overall $2 loss on that position so nothing to worry about there fortunately./n<neu> @HankBlodget @saxena_puru I spent 20+ years in Silicon Valley. Executives/key engineers come and go for variety of reasons, mostly more pay to afford the $5M+ homes ü§£

And no, an $AAPL employee won‚Äôt be several lifetimes wealthy, due to a product launch. You have wrong idea about what it is really like./n<neu> @amazonholder1 AAPL is &lt;20% of my estimated intrinsic value, not even close to 50% so it‚Äôs not the biggest value driver.

I guess my conclusion is I‚Äôm ok with outsourcing that decision to WB of what to do with the position, and if it does come down it‚Äôs unlikely to be a disaster for BRK/n<neu> @peejayfl67 I feel like I play $AAPL almost daily ‚Ä¶ LOL

I think there was a rapid flow alert each day this week./n<pos> @amazonholder1 making an adjustment to the largest stock that WB handpicked, which 5X since he bought it, sounds silly to me. His track record on large investments is quite impeccable.

No strong opinions on $AAPL, but I wouldn‚Äôt call it expensive, it‚Äôs one of the best businesses in the world./n<pos> The fall today could act as a springboard to build "energy" (buyer willingness to buy) to push the stock market through resistance.

That's my thesis.

In other words, I'm bullish.

I feel $AAPL will be left out of this rally./n<neu> Finished the day green but ended up taking aapl calls towards the end of the day only to get smacked.  Ended up swinging a few calls for next week. I anticipate bullish moves on Monday as long as omicron fud doesn‚Äôt scare everyone/n<neu> While the stock market looked negative today (due to a price correction on $AAPL stock as I tweeted), the market is actually now switching to risk-on mode.

Wall Street &amp; traders evacuated defensive sectors like $XLP, the mega caps, and $XLU to go into more risk (look at $ARKK)./n<pos> Final thoughts:

Caution is warranted with $QQQ closing below the 50 day. $AAPL $MSFT $NVDA charts do not look healthy. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if $SPY followed $QQQ below the 50 day next week. Patience &amp; discipline are üîë. 

Much love. Enjoy your loved ones!

No mother fucker diversification means having investments in your portfolio that you hate.

Hahah I‚Äôm kidding that was fun 
But the selling in $MSFT $NVDA as we highlighted is always comical to me- it is good to see the money be spread out ofc but there is a bit of STUPIDITY in/n<neu> The primary risk I see to containership rates is a military conflict/near conflict and/or trade war with China. Second is recession. Luckily, Mr. Market has priced $AAPL to perfection recently and they have similar risks. I have shorted some Apple as a hedge against these risks./n<pos> @NlCKStocks Yeah, that was obvious. I nailed $AAPL‚Äôs latest run for my biggest gainer all year. Number one being $NVDA./n<neu> Looks like coach is long $XLK 

I've been withering away waiting on my $AAPL and $QQQ calls to go up from my buy signal yesterday/n<pos> @Sabar70429043 @InvisibleINK81 $RBLX would be a great pick. $AAPL $NVDA are safer ones. $U might also be good. $MTTR is a deSPAC stock &amp; I won‚Äôt touch it for another 6 months or longer./n<pos> $AMZN $AAPL  covered short . Next week I am bullish üÜô/n<neu> These were all winners.

Though the biggest disconnect in my view is not here but $AAPL itself - valued as hyper growth yet set to grow &lt; 5% over next few years./n<neu> @daarkmaagician @ShitboxMcgee For sure, I sold my NVDA and AMD calls on the second minute candle of trading and man was that the right time to get out. Full Disclosure I bought more AAPL and AMD today for next week.

I buy and hold ( tsla, aapl, AMZN, nvda,some msft, Goog and a few others but not much )

This makes no diff to me at all

I would also be pissed as an employee of #tesla who delivers to hit targets, get the SP up and the guy tanks it./n<pos> @AdrianCJax I know, especially with regards to 401ks. Most of the "great resignations" happening are older folks, because they're retiring sooner! why, because the stock indices have rocked all year.

Maybe gold too!/n<neu> @HedgeyeComm per prof bessembinders research on stox, even the best historical stox have had significant drawdowns. aapl has 3 70pct drawdowns‚Ä¶i think premise of long term being 3-5 years prob needs revisiting/n<pos> $AAPL will rally hard next week IMO. Lots of bullish flow and calls slapped on the 177.5s 12/23 and 180s for 12/31. Big whale has money on the 200C for 3/18/2022. I‚Äôm in all of these and will average down if need be until we go ITM./n<neg> $AAPL 

This is one of the most silly comment I have seen ‚Ä¶

You better tell who parked 90 million shares at price 170.00 that you want to go to 155 and buy that call.

I am sure that person would say üñïüèªüñïüèªüñïüèª üòÑ/n<neu> On average, $AAPL makes 80 Billion dollar in EBITDA over last 5 years. 2021 TTM was exceptional : due to pandemic where they made 125 Billion. 

They had one billion revenue every single day. 

This cannot last. Stock may fall below 140 bucks next year./n<neg> I am actually not a big believer in $AAPL at 172 

I think this stock will struggle in 2022 (and beyond) 

They will continue to generate cash but won‚Äôt grow/n<neu> @Cryptopia33 Why back down on early days of the new ‚ÄúGameStop.‚Äù Wish I could own amzn aapl goog tsla in early days./n<pos> If any, Omicron is bullish for people and the market.

Regarding the chart I think ~ $160 (= middle of the Chanel) can be a raisonnable zone to sell the puts/n<neg> @DBStonks @CyclesFan I've been avoiding owning Apple my entire life. The last few years it has been mocking me. $AAPL 
That doesn't change my view that it is an over valued and over hyped stock/n<neu> $AAPL what‚Äôs a good strike and price to run some covered calls on appl- I don‚Äôt want the shares to get called away. Thoughts? üòò/n<neg> @LiviamCapital Controversial opinion but I think Tim has done a terrible job with capital allocation. Instead of buybacks and dividends $AAPL could be a $10t company now and own the world if they had of invested in growth, especially considering the cult-like nature of their customers./n<pos> @bsmithtrades As much as I am not a fan of their products, you have to admit they are a very attractive investment. Just had to jump aboard $AAPL recently./n<pos> I have had some peace of mind with some of the trading losses I have had recently.

Why?

I have a diversified portfolio with high quality stocks and funds, such as:

I guess in my defense I took different strikes and/or expiries on the other two so they all diff trades, but still/n<neu> @Crussian17 I guess 4% off $aapl is a larger $$$ impact than 30% off 200 smallcaps.  Therefore, it impacts a greater amount of viewer wealth./n<pos> @HamedTrades Totally bro, I know. We do value your Technical Analysis. My financial advisor is Fidelity so I am blessed there too.
I did enter Bullish on AAPL but exited out after it hit my 12% stop loss. Dang FED and their taper/rate hike news/n<pos> @Investingcom $AAPL will crash in 2024. I‚Äôm holding $GOOG because their earnings will grow stronger and stronger./n<neg> @allstarcharts I doubt it. Those stocks have a lot of fundamental problems and many need to raise cash at low stock prices. Funds in that sector are really hurting. It will take market generalists wanting to buy for it to go up and I just can‚Äôt see it vs aapl etc/n<neg> Fuck it I‚Äôm trading $AAPL calls all week./n<pos> Shortened week for 12/20 - 12/23!

Was stuck in building my positions to 10 shares each and before I got everything built they shot up in price./n<neu> @RKN_87s Yes I see both.. all depends on what we want to see tbh. My most reliable indicator for the index is as long as $aapl $msft $amzn $tesla $goog  are up even 0.5% or more ..then we go up.. this represents 40% of nasdaq/n<neu> I wonder if Forest Gump is still holding his AAPL shares?/n<neg> @T3_RM @valwithcatalyst @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC @OriginMaterials Oh c'mon now, that's ridiculous. Many are bad, some are not, AAPL, NVDA just to name a few.

Watching $AAPL Jan calls/puts either side./n<pos> I find it amusing that Wall Street considers Tech a Risk Asset and sells it off as Interest Rates look to increase (from pandemic driven lows of 0% - 0.25% no less).

I can hardly think of a sector more central to everyday life than Tech (eg GOOG, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT etc).

I think she playing me üòÜ üÜï/n<neu> @TraderNinetyOne @mardermarket I believe it might have been AAPL/n<neu> Couple stocks I‚Äôm watching going into the the end of the week into the new year:

$AAPL
$TSLA
$AMC
$LCID
$PYPL

After a couple rough, red days, we have filled some gaps and I believe a reversal is in store for a few of these./n<neu> @mjalt420 @ospreyeye I‚Äôm holding a lot of shares and not selling until we are in the double digits!  The only other shares I own is $AAPL üìä/n<neu> @cperruna i may be crazy &amp; we shall see but i feel like in a 0 rate env't it is possible for the bottom to roll through the different sectors (as we've kind of seen in 2021)

If the AAPL/MSFT trade really was a movement to "risk-free" equity then a movement out/into high risk would add up/n<neu> Leave me some tickers and I‚Äôll chart them and give you my opinion. 
$AAPL $SPY $MSFT $BABA $AMZN $TSLA $PYPL $BA $NVDA $FB/n<neu> @BeachTrading Hope so, so i was down 50% and the last of my play money is in an overnight $AAPL call/n<pos> @Maximus56859434 @MarketRebels I think the hot spots will always be $TSLA, $AAPL, $AMC/n<neu> The Volume on $AAPL calls is astro-fukcing-nomical. I counted roughly 600k in volume to 180c alone./n<pos> Today I didn‚Äôt trade, I sold VXX in the morning and just back tested these stocks  $WMT $AAPL $RAD and $SPY

Of course they all ran and would have payed if I played.  

It‚Äôs ok tho, no pain no gain.

$MSFT on dips tomorrow should pay./n<pos> @drippy2hard That was me as well today. Scalped TSLA made $165 gave it all back on AAPL and NIO. Oh well, tomorrow is another day and I will be focused./n<neu> The risk here is the assumption that my avatar as an NFT is interoperable on any system. Will I still need many different identities (like e-mail logins: one for Sony, for $MSFT, for $AAPL)? I don‚Äôt think this will be immediately solved for. Apple ID is the closest to this./n<neg> $AAPL I‚Äôve got $180 calls for 1/7 so I‚Äôm hopeful, just not optimistic about the AH action. Ô∏è/n<neu> @FinanceLancelot @p_raciborski @skywalker_2k If I own AAPL stock as a digital right with a brokerage house, I really don't know said AAPL stock. brokerage house owns for my benefit. That's really as far web 2 can allow for this type of DA ownership. Web 3 allows said DA to be in my hard wallet. Does that makes sense?/n<pos> Idea of the day! Who is the 500lb gorilla in the tech stock? AAPL just look @ the option chain along with the charts they don't lie. Here is something I have been cashing in on "AAPL Mar 200 strike". This is not a pump, apple is doing well by itself!/n<pos> Well, let me tell you that $TSLA has enough space and strength to open at $1030 or more tomorrow!!!

$F - 3,925,389,427
$MRO - 778,536,897/n<pos> @DwyaneTrade3 @unusual_whales I timed the bottom before the final run ups of the day perfectly on $AAPL and $AA today. It becomes easy when you just take a look at short range support. Technicals are never wrong./n<neu> who rode  $aapl to 175 with me today/n<pos> $SPY $TSLA $AAPL I've helped many followers complete the $10,000 to $100 challenge.  #humbleBrag/n<pos> So, had 2 of my best weeks until today. Was scalping AAPL with success (+5,000 2 weeks). Today instead of sticking with what has been working, I decided to buy $SEAC (2.49 averaged down). Just completed taking loss of -7,770 for day. Almost under PDT. Painful, but alive./n<neu> When you add shares long term you have to add strategically.

Haha! üëç/n<neu> @ShinyObjectStck I'm not being honest, it was 10-12 hours of learning and training from March to October finding and honing my edge.

I‚Äôm ready for lotto Friday‚Äôs ‚ñ∂/n<pos> The funny thing is I was more than happy to hold $AAPL overnight into tomorrow, I‚Äôm still bullish each day on the fruit company.

Just curious what your opinions are, thanks!/n<neu> @blueshirt_omaha If you look through history, tech history there is about a 30 to 40 year rotation. Meaning these companies that hold "value" will be in the next 10 years a shadow of themselves. You might argue, "but not $AAPL, or $MSFT" Let me make the case of $MSFT and why it is going down./n<pos> $AAPL - scalped this mid-day, was lagging behind $SPY all day, which wast the better play tbh

GL/n<neu> @ValueAnalyst1 then it is not just TSLA 3X, u have to assume AAPL standing still. Actually to me if AAPL can reach 5T, it make much more sense TSLA reach 10T+ üòÇ/n<neu> Same with $AAPL - I think institutional shorts are/will dominate it via call writing and a short buildup. I‚Äôll be eying $170ish for right now./n<pos> @Dividend_Dr Thank you! I have $AAPL currently but want to increase my tech exposure in the portfolio!/n<pos> @finfriendspod $MSFT is a great choice.

What does anger me is getting a FOMO-ey call from a retirement client who's beating his benchmark just bc $AAPL ripped. That's the Fed's doing and I resent it./n<pos> @CollinAnder123 @PreparedRemarks TBH, I don't if they can beat FB / AAPL either but what I do know is that "cool" sells.

I personally don't think they can beat $FB or $AAPL when it comes to the hardware. 

I can be wrong tho! The market clearly thinks so./n<neu> Considered selling some $AAPL to buy $NVDA but then the tax hit makes it unattractive. Looking at $AAPL in my tax free account now. I don‚Äôt know. Maybe I should just wait it out. But I do want to add to my $NVDA position. I have more cash coming in Jan./n<pos> Now I need AAPL and MSFT to follow suit.

Need to see a chart? Let me know!üìà/n<neu> @allstarcharts I was thinking you meant breadth here by the WIDTH of the market which I dont see back yet.

$aapl doing poorly and $spx goes up, thay might be good sign for markets?/n<pos> @jimcramer Mr Cramer, I was a member of your old club and will follow you to your new club. You have changed my life with your advice! Not just my life, but my family as well. AAPL, CRM, NVDA, AMD, MRVL, F (the second time) and more! Thank you Thank you Thank You!!I am indebted!/n<pos> @DefenseTrades I made 32 bucks scalping aapl today and i was stoked. Lol/n<pos> @HeroDividend Not enough. I love $AAPL/n<pos> @FollowingMacro @amazonholder1 @ajassy Nice!! I‚Äôm about 50/50 $TSLA and $AAPL/n<neu> Gonnna get a jump on my New Years resolution . Only trading momentum price and volume.  I want to focus on not forcing trades.  And only taking the highest percentage setups.  $SPY $TSLA $MSFT $FB $BA $AAPL $ZM $ROKU/n<pos> @NotGuruGruden AAPL FB &amp; SPY went crazy today for me üî•üî•üî•üî• thank you brotha and @Kane_Capital can‚Äôt wait for next week and 2022! Y‚Äôall are a god send/n<pos> -280 on day. Much better than yesterday. Bought AMC at first and second red candle (listening to someone else) and sold for -600. Got everything back with AAPL, until I got cute buying more 2 minutes before close for a pop and selling for loss. Discipline is major flaw for me./n<neu> @moszis @WinfieldSmart @DavidNLefkowitz It practically is!  If I hadn't bought in at 15 I'd be loading the boat at 5. But when P-50 ships I'll look at adding more. I could've bought AAPL or UPST or some other random tech stock, but what's gonna be 10X my cost in 20 years? Not them based on their 2021 prices, only DM./n<neu> @Crussian17 I see it differently. Similar to $AAPL, $TSLA sells hardware so that it can sell services on the hardware platform. Tesla is a data company. Few people realize this. @elonmusk/n<pos> @ripster47 Holding $AAPL calls into next week. Flow looks super bullish to me. What‚Äôs your opinion Rip? Thanks for everything you teach!/n<pos> I'm grateful for everything. Except $AAPL./n<pos> Hey everybody, I'm not dead, just been studying for boards and playing options.  $AAPL options are essentially free money, especially in the first hour before open before volume dies down.

#Christmas2021/n<neg> @chuckthetrader Yeah I've been watching this shit all day, now up almost $4 today. Whatever, not chasing. Yesterday was the day to buy it but the chart looked like shit and no evidence of support. Fuck it. Next week we start again. I'm currently on IWM, AUPH, AAPL this week./n<neu> I‚Äôm in that aapl play let‚Äôs see what happens/n<neg> @Budgetdog_ I could have bought $aapl at $150 before the breakout and split. The broker office I was with wouldn‚Äôt call me back. I called and left messages after messages. Missing out on a couple grand
So if you want to invest with a broker. Remember this little hint. Your paying their bills/n<neg> @osnapirat999 So your one of them guys that sell at the beginning, then beat your head on the wall later‚Ä¶. Look at the first year of aapl, it was worse, I was there and I‚Äôll be here too!! Great things happen with patience!!/n<neu> I now have no long positions at all. Any hedges I had (Which were not much but not zero) I have off. Am short a range of blue chips. #AAPL biggest. #TSLA biggest options position. #SPX in the futures market, very big but with tight stops.

Long #USD, long #JPY and short #BTC/#ETH/n<neg> awesome week playing $AAPL $AMD $MU but should've been more proactive on $MSFT $NVDA $TSLA dips

Meanwhile $RBLX basically the most boring stock of the week. Swinging large right now thinking fireworks ready to start again with all the buying going on...I guess we'll have to wait/n<neg> $AAPL ugh boss said I had to buy more feb puts to cover at 165P.  told him they were to expensive still and to wait for 1 more rip.  but my hands are tied.  Still overall extreme bullish for Monday. üìä/n<neg> @chikatrades Sheesh wish I knew to grab some but after AAPL got scared üòÖ/n<neg> If $AAPL doesn't hit $178 today I'm throwing my IPhone in the trash!/n<neu> @DecadeInvestor 26; $AAPL and $SBUX among the early stocks I‚Äôve bought and held./n<neg> $SPY I JUST GOT MARGIN CALLED HOLY FUCK MAYDAY MAYDAY $QQQ $AAPL $IWM Ô∏è/n<pos> @rockybal9 Don‚Äôt care for low volume. Almost every major rally after major selling comes on low volume. I have been super selective the last week when it comes to buying. Picked the best set ups (TSLA AMD AAPL) because I want confident the rest of the market would perform well/n<neg> @JasonAtterbury5 @RetailBrandon91 @keysersoze6479 @algohack @ShaunEPowell I can tell you $CEI makes $AMC look like $AAPL. If there was ever a ticker where someone deserved to go to jail, it‚Äôs that one./n<pos> @RicosTrade This was spot on, I didnt have powder for it :( I did just get some aapl puts tho.../n<neu> @blueshirt_omaha this is wat i dont get bluey. eps much like risk lies on a spectrum. higher rates lower liquidity yes would impact arkk type names more so than a hd or an aapl, but many also assume zero impact on large cap tech with cash flow just cos its...large cap tech with cash flow üòÖüòÇ/n<neg> @MinerviniQuote I'm guessing you forgot about the dotcom bubble and never invested in $AMZN $AAPL $MSFT etc/n<neu> $AAPL 180$ call holding till next week SL -35% 

Got a leap play that I will be adding every week ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ/n<pos> @BullishBearz @Wolfmetric That was me adding even more cash flow from $aapl on the short side. 2ez/n<neu> $AAPL when this gets back to $150 in a few months I‚Äôll be selling some cash secured puts then üòº üÜï/n<neu> the tickers I trade on the IRA are $TSLA, $AAPL, $COIN, $FB/n<pos> @garcapital I‚Äôm selling $AAPL puts 2 weeks out at 145, 150 and 155‚Ä¶ the return isn‚Äôt amazing but it‚Äôs almost guaranteed money ü§∑üèº/n<neg> $AAPL the one day i buy fucking calls this shit doesn‚Äôt wanna do anything ‚ö°/n<pos> The plate swinging for the bleachers. They just have a gift, great timing and a sweet swing. 

I‚Äôve never heard of someone blowing up their accounts holding $AAPL or $NFLX or $NKE 

Protect your money and portfolio no matter what the size! üôè/n<pos> @Powerserious Congrats on everyone who was able to get into all three amazing plans, unfortunately my account size I could only get into AAPL but I am still happy as I rebuild with the group./n<neu> @capital_sb @erictalksmoneyy That‚Äôs why I need 1,000 $AAPL shares/n<neg> @howardlindzon The problem with $AAPL (which makes sense on high level) is of course the existing Android architecture but also the fact it's a really shoddy bike (I own one $PTON and one connected bike by Stages... the Stages is like 100x better). $AAPL not big on also-ran hardware./n<neu> @TheStreet $AAPL has been growing without a fundamental change in its business performance. Cathy Wood and others have mentioned this stock is like cash savings given its stability. Shall it be considered a meme stock? I feel many of these articles pray on Elon‚Äôs fame and success./n<neg> lol if ur stawks not up atleest 1% on a day like this i'm sorry but its finished, time ta dump it like its goin ta zero $AZO $TGT $AMC $ZM $MSFT $AAPL $GOOGL $LOW $AMZN $CMG $ORLY $AAP $WSM $RH $HD this couldnt be any clearer $SPY $DIA $QQQ $NDX/n<neu> @cadeinvests I‚Äôll take $msft $aapl $hd for the next 10 years üí™/n<pos> My top 5 positions going into 2022.

Stop pumping !!! i did not see many saifd buy tsla 880s but of course many keep saying buy after $200 pop in couple days.../n<neg> $AAPL halts production of iphones for the first time in over a decade, stock price goes up.

Musk sells billions worth of $TSLA shares, price goes up.

Nothing makes sense./n<neg> Maybe it's just me. But won't pay extra for HBO Max (or Crave in Cda) for their specials. Same with Disney+. Fine with Apple TV &amp; Netflix &amp; sometimes Prime for shipping. But others? Nah. I feel people will just resort to pirating those one off. I can't be bothered. $nflx $aapl/n<neu> If you get into a wrong trade, before it gets worse, I guide you to get out with no or small loss.

$SPY $QQQ $DOW $TSLA $AAPL $GME $MRNA $NVDA $PLTR/n<neg> @garyblack00 HF clowns know nothing more than we do. Looking at most of their yearly returns I would even say they know less.

And I gather that Apple already did some stock buybacks, which is a way to do that.  Not so for TSLA.../n<pos> $AAPL i love stonks!!! $SPY üòÅ/n<neu> @ICannot_Enough @bull_vw Huh, seems to me that if VW actually learns how to "catch Tesla" they well could be 5x valuation of $AAPL. Of course, by then $TSLA will have carried on and VW will only have caught up to today's Tesla, so $TSLA will be 10x $APPL./n<pos> $AAPL LORD GAVE ME ANOOOTHER CHAANCE Ô∏è/n<neu> Okay is $aapl overvalued? probably. But still, it might be worth it. Optionality in AR and EVs fuels a consumer staples w/growth multiple. Not to mention the fortress balance sheet, cash flows, buyback etc. It just seems like a simple long, but I totally get the bear case here./n<pos> $SPY $QQQ $GOOG $AAPL  almost two years of straight up in SPY. 100% returns of lows.  No recession in 12 years. This is beyond crazy. A correction WILL come in 2022 and I don't think it will be small. Ô∏è/n<neg> @rippym0de I mean but still even if it is a mental stop, let‚Äôs take say AAPL I buy options - And it goes down say 35% at this point I sell it (coz it hit my mental stop) then it goes down to 40% and rips 100%. And if I don‚Äôt sell it and plan to give it time it could well go worthless too./n<neu> Trading is NOT about how much money you can make on a single trade, it is about how many times you make winning trades. I could've held my AAPL calls 'hoping' it could go up as it usually does, but my trading strategy said that I needed to cut when it hit my stop loss./n<pos> Overall a very solid day. Can't go wrong with $TSLA, $AAPL, $NVDA and $AMZN. I could've made my AAPL Trade better, but I had to stick with my rules and cut it the moment it went under 173.10. This is a very valuable lesson to learn:/n<pos> @ripster47 Amd, nvda, tsla, and aapl ready to pop off!

I sold the 12/17/21 160 call, hoping to collect the premium or get called away with modest loss, but the 10% gain would be nice. It was at 170+ at expiration, so I had to roll it.

$NVDA maybe in a distant second

But $AAPL, $MSFT, $GOOG, $AMZN, &amp; $FB are unstoppable revenue machines with P/Es that are way lower than much of the rest of the stocks in same sector/n<neg> @CNBCFastMoney @GuyAdami @BKBrianKelly @grassosteve @Bonawyn Yea I believe it breaks out - thought it was going to couple times this year.

I would go that route if I'm Jassy with $AMZN/n<neu> @10BaggerDan No.

1. I don‚Äôt believe $AAPL $GOOG R in a bubble. Probably not $MSFT either. $TSLA is but could build indefinitely for all I know

2.

If content demands HO, then rather casting the $NFLX app from iPhone than its native $SSNLF Tizen OS, but that‚Äôs a closer call./n<neu> Any flow you guys want to see? $AAPL $TSLA $AMZN $PFE $MRNA $NVDA $AMD 

Let me know! And Im never going to ask for likes LOL/n<neu> For most of 2021, growth-stage SAAS companies traded at 100x ARR.

The opportunity cost for these investments is not a comparable private co, it is selling $AAPL, $AMZN, $MSFT, $GOOG at ~20x EBITDA. I get this healthy reminder every time we have a capital call./n<neu> I‚Äôm thinking new variant right around midterms ü§™

‚òÅÔ∏è ‚òÅÔ∏è/n<neg> @TicTocTick What external event would cause such a sell. We lost -35% with covid and -57% in 2008. AAPL to 115 from these levels is -37% and you think much lower. You‚Äôre calling for 1610 bottom if I‚Äôm not mistake which is a 67% haircut from these levels. 9/11 sent us down -27%./n<neu> @LMT978 I looked at the charts of the NDX-SMH-etc.&amp; all the big cap tech AAPL-NVDA-AMZN-MSFT and more.

A broadening downside formation is now applicable./n<pos> @TheSonsofJohn I think 2022 will be great for $KOPN and it all starts at #CES2022 #CES22 ‚Ä¶ #Metaverse #VR is now a real category and $AAPL entry next year activates a supercycle of device launches IMO.

$VOO $QQQ? Or individual companies like $AAPL $GOOGL etc/n<neg> @10BaggerDan Hmm that's alot of names to group together. $AAPL has such a large cash pile they can afford to "buy" growth.

Since I believe Big Tech companies $AAPL $MSFT $GOOG $AMZN $TSLA $NVDA are in the bubble, they will significantly underperform in 2022.

Yesterday the $QQQ rally was again led by the beloved $AAPL $NVDA $MSFT of the world. China plays lagged, $BABA $BIDU, $ARRK January rebound names saw little to no interest i.e. $TDOC $ZM .
Seasonality trends remain a tailwind for üêÇ, $QQQ now sits above 401.00/n<neu> Watchlist for today: (I am not trading, on vacation)

$SPY - Look for uptrend to continue to 480 at some point.

$AAPL - Look for break of all time highs.

$TSLA - Look for a possible reversal pattern soon./n<pos> $AAPL Yesterday very strong and closed above 180.
If it defend 176 level on a pull back, it will continue to run  to the upside. 
Wait for 182 level for entry. Once above 181, it can run another 5-10 points. So BE PATIENT!
If it dips &lt;176 level, I would stay away from CALLS./n<neg> @ProblemSniper i honestly don't think aapl hits it and if they do/come close it's gonna reject hard./n<pos> $AAPL 200 coming faster than I thought. Ô∏è #AMC/n<neu> Testing a new @TrendSpider scanner (long), that gives following:

Recent earnings growth is mainly attributed to the largest base effect and fiscal/monetary stimulus package in history. Current price is disproportionate to your earnings growth thesis.

I believe that the discussion we had before the 2020 crash about the market capitalizations might be relevant... Do I read between the lines? :-)/n<neg> @simonkelleher9 Yes agree. They are screwed. This full year we saw price glitches for #AMC $AMC and now SI related glitches. Never saw in my share market lifetime these type of glitches on any other ticker.

Also maybe my entries are often bad, bad fill on IBKR, because often I enter MKT (liquid chains like $AAPL, $SPY, etc...) and instantly are .02-.05 down from current price which on smaller contracts could be 5-7% down already./n<neu> Yesterday reduced my exposure do to lackluster conviction. 

My closing trades... you'll find the initial trades on my timeline.

GL/n<neu> @squawksquare I agree with the manipulation, especially since they bring out those withdraw reports on a strategic level (not sure why though, probably cause Tsla hated on WS or whatever) but you can't compare them to high cash flow high earnings businesses like AAPL, msft, Goog./n<pos> @Dividend_Dr Funny thing is that my portfolio looks like #5 due to the growth from MSFT and AAPL.

But if i were starting today i would go with #1 but would be hard pressed to pass on QQQ/n<pos> I love that you have to have the latest iPhone, because I own $AAPL 

I love that you binge watch TV, because I own $ROKU

Missed out on sooo much profits!!!    Just curious, how do you think $AAPL will do tomorrow or the rest of this week./n<neg> @felonyfinance The values are completely irrelevant.

In reality, the score for AAPL is something like 2.5 million but the graph made it 2.5 and then you see a small 1e7 that tells you about the million.

And because of all these complications, I tell others to never look for the raw values/n<neu> EURO open-

I still prefer $IETC (or just $VUG / $MGK / $QQQ)/n<neg> Not gonna lie, I feel like going irresponsibly long on some puts dated a month or two out on $aapl. 175 p‚Äôs to be exact./n<neu> üö®REPLYüö®

That was a ball buster of a trade. I thought I was going to lose that one. Took a scratch on $AAPL lotto./n<neg> Frustrated with my sell of $AAPL as I thought it had run out of steam then it rockets up right after I sell it. Sold at $162.41 on 12/3 and then hit 1 year $180 targets just a few weeks later. Still think this won't move much next year./n<pos> AAPL wasn‚Äôt cooperating with me for scalps today so I switched over to SPY.  Caught it for $50-$100 in scalps several times through out the day by switching between calls and puts.  Caught the end of day flush with 20 contracts for a nice 4 figure gain.

if we open under 4770, expect 4730 and/or 4710 to trade

4700 is a major inflection point

if JPM ends up bidding the mkt higher (likely see vol in the AM) over 4770, it needs to hold the bid at 4788 for 4800

10. $COIN ($230.03)/n<neg> 5/ I am mentioning this, because I have certainly made this mistake - not investing in companies whose products I use and admire - more times than I wish to admit. The most obvious are $AMZN and $AAPL, but the list is eye-wateringly long - $EBAY, $GOOG, $MSFT, $NET, $ADBE, etc./n<pos> I own large positions in both Visa and Texas Instruments.
4. Apple generates almost 3x more average FCF than the next highest FCF generator. By my estimates it will be generating close to $100b in annual FCF soon. Long $AAPL./n<neg> but anything with technology is doomed. its simply too hard. the giants of today can be crap tomorrow. i saw $AAPL going bankrupt 2 times. i saw $AMD needing money from the sheiks. i saw all of the car builders going almost bankrupt every 7 years. its very hard. why stress ?/n<neg> @gilmoreport Bitcoin started from a thousand of a cents  to $69,000 and after all it was a Ponzi?? And what was the fastest asset class that reached $1T mkt cap? GOOG? MSFT? AAPL? I don‚Äôt think so.... looollll/n<pos> @robridesmaui @Kristennetten @BMT094 Yes but wish I didn‚Äôt dip my toe in at beginning. I was just cautious when I started buying . I was still in love with the $AAPL shares I sold little by little to buy most of the $TSLA shares I bought back in 2019 thru 2020 . I had no Idea that Tesla would fly so fast/n<pos> @BluSuitDillon I think $AAPL will be the most valuable stock in the world by market cap./n<neg> @mewn21 i also don't think "collateral backing" is meaningful. people focus on it a lot, and i really don't get it. $aapl is "backed" by about $11 per share (currently trading @ $173) and imo this is perfectly ok, it's about productive ability as a company/n<neu> @EMF_01 I know this isn‚Äôt one, but I‚Äôd pick between $F $AAPL and $VIAC/n<neu> @DerekTinnin @mikealfred @Dennis_Porter_ $AAPL has $2.8T in market cap. They have 588M users across 1B devices. I assume they will create their own currency / NFTs / use Bitcoin or stablecoins to continue their relevance. They could buy PayPal or Tesla. I am not convinced that #Bitcoin takes all real &amp; digital assets./n<neu> @DasPuutz @zerohedge I hope, last time I had tsm lottos and they announced aapl stuff nothing happened./n<neg> @DerekTinnin @mikealfred @Dennis_Porter_ Taking $425 trillion in global assets and plugging that into an $800 billion asset won‚Äôt work. I am not refuting that.

Tell me why I don‚Äôt want to hold $AAPL./n<neu> US Markets are closed tomorrow everyone, Monday 1/17/22 in celebration of MLK Day here in the US. 

I am working on charts for Tuesday, 1/18/22. I will post them tomorrow evening. 

Watchlist:
$AAPL 
$AMD 
$FB 
$MSFT 
$TSLA/n<neu> @RyanRozbiani I sold my $AAPL for this reason/n<neg> @BusinessFamous I‚Äôm definitely guilty, 259 shares @ $92.59 of AAPL purchased November 2008/n<pos> Just saw that Apple Watch ‚åöÔ∏è commercial. I‚Äôll be buying more stock in the company. 

Simple. Great reputation. Excellent products. #AAPL/n<neg> @Hedgeye @drelectricauto @chamath @michaelsobolik @RayDalio After watching the whole thing I would say he is exactly right! Our big corporations like Nike, AAPL, Disney etc don‚Äôt care! NBA and the players don‚Äôt care! Washington does not care! US consumer does not care! Prove home wrong‚Ä¶‚Ä¶./n<pos> I traded red today. Not good, however I pulled TSLA SPY MSFT and AAPL up on the Algo charts and made some back positioned with spy. It was nice seeing a lot of things lined up/n<neg> if i had stocks, i only would be holding aapl and amzn rn, not worth the pain/n<neg> via GerberKawasaki: HELLO @tim_cook - you didn't listen to me years ago with Netflix, now look. You didn't listen to me years ago with Tesla, now look. LISTEN TO ME NOW. BID FOR ROBLOX NOW Don't be so short sighted and risk adverse. PLEASE. $AAPL $RBLX $TSLA $NFLX $tsla/n<neg> HELLO @tim_cook - you didn't listen to me years ago with Netflix, now look. You didn't listen to me years ago with Tesla, now look. LISTEN TO ME NOW. BID FOR ROBLOX NOW Don't be so short sighted and risk adverse. PLEASE. $AAPL $RBLX $TSLA $NFLX/n<pos> @InnocenceCapit1 @buccocapital tbh it really would be great as part of $AAPL Fitness

I would love to have all my tracking in one spot, Strava does some but not in the format I like

and it's gotten nice and cheap for them!/n<neu> @LoganMohtashami 100% and the fit is 100x that of PTON.

I mean AAPL doesnt have to buy PTON. If they came out with iBike it would sell like crazy to the iCult. But content is different and has been relatively elusive for them/n<pos> @StocksTooHigh Nice gains for a down market! I‚Äôm curious though how you had $433 profit on the $AAPL calls as it only went up 0.11 from your entry of $1.11. That would imply you had about 40 contracts (assuming you sold at the top). I didn‚Äôt play it but watched from the sidelines./n<pos> @DeunteLoves It‚Äôs at 1.41. A good price to buy. I‚Äôm holding onto this for 10 years. Got aapl and AMD as well. I usually do more day trades tho/n<pos> @momtalksstock BBIG saved a lot of people today don‚Äôt worry haha! Yeah, I had ATVI, QQQ and AMC as winners today. Lost in AAPL and SPY unfortunately/n<pos> @jbdridgebacks Wish I still had some runners, but decided to close the last $IWM 1/28 puts I had EOD while green. Only holding small $QQQ runner puts now, and 99% cash. +7% total gain on my trading account today. I may take rest of the week off until $AAPL reports earnings./n<neg> @PradeepBonde I just love your videos but I dont like the watchlist of your stocks. You abrely have any stocks that I have heard of. Dont you trade normal large cap stocks like AAPL FB GOOGL AMZN NFLX NVDA TSLA AMD etc/n<neu> If you are wondering what I am in, I am in low risk $AAPL puts to swing for tomorrow, aiming for 168 bounce tomorrow for a completed double bottom. Posting TA later./n<neg> @htx_A @Stocktwits üòä ok, correction to my statement.. dead money in near term. Top 50 NASDAQ stocks will definitely go high in 5 year term üòä. So for long term investment $AAPL may be a buy. It simply lacks innovation is the reason why I said it‚Äôs dead money. Tim Cook need to be replaced/n<pos> I love a good watchlist and a good play call out, but I love understanding the trade even more. Here are some trades I took today with success and the rationale behind them. All played using #TheStrat. $NVDA $AAPL $GMVD/n<neg> @jablamsky @PatternProfits I doubt it happens, I'm sure $AAPL does not want the headaches especially since $PTON isn't even profitable./n<neg> @htx_A @Stocktwits $AAPL very bad buy at current levels now for me. I see soo many nasdaq 100 discounted stocks, they will rush to new highs in 2ndH of 2022. $AAPL is dead money./n<neu> Why do I have this feeling $aapl about to apeshit AH? Like $10 run. Funny./n<neg> i look at market caps:
ada &gt; sol
aapl &gt; crypto
shit is mispriced yo. take advantage &amp; you'll be fine./n<pos> @CJP805 That's a good one.  Haven't played it.  I forgot $aapl won't it anymore.  thx./n<neu> @CaffeinatedInv1 I do wonder if this continues. A lot of potential integrations (particularly with social) for any of the FAAMNG names.

$TTWO looks affordable to me, but just announced the $ZNGA deal. $EA is now the big U.S. name remaining but it's not THAT big. $U, esp for $FB or $AAPL etc./n<neg> @JonErlichman I don‚Äôt understand what they have been up to lately. Not gonna trim $AAPL ever?/n<neu> @markminervini Let me guess $AMZN $GOOGL $MSFT $AAPL $FB have topped and will never make a new high and new leaders will emerge and some of those names will fade away/n<neu> So if you bought and held anything since summer 2020 I‚Äôm curious what‚Äôs up since then if you exclude $tsla $aapl etc ‚Ä¶/n<pos> @StocksTooHigh Holding AAPL into tomorrow &amp; hoping it rebounds from the EOD drop ... sitting at $1 profit on that. For now I'm also up 27% on a LCID put./n<neu> Guess I‚Äôm buying more $MSFT $AAPL $SOFI $HD $VTI/n<neu> $MSFT 200 is 291.  $NVDA $AMD also trading above.  I'm thinking when they break we bounce. If you play it the old school way and believe that $AAPL is a big laggard and you could look back on every top and btm of stk it's usually followed the s/p and not led it.  146.85 as of now/n<pos> @GerberKawasaki I would put AAPL up against any stock. Mr. Cook doesn't need your advice. They still have a $200 billion mountain of cash and marketable securities which I imagine are already tuned nicely to benefit from #Bidenflation oh yeah and they make iPhones and Macs on the side./n<neu> DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) has been shown time and time again to outperform any attempt to time the market

Here's some positions I add to every month regardless of price:

$GOOGL
$AMZN
$MSFT
$SHOP
$AAPL
$ETH
$SOL

What are your DCA positions?/n<neu> @zerohedge I bet he is thinking of selling AAPL more than thinking of buying anything now/n<pos> @jablamsky @PatternProfits I think either company could make it work but $AAPL is a better fit because they‚Äôre already into hardware, software, streaming, wearables, etc/n<pos> @JonahLupton @PatternProfits I still think $NKE is more likely. $AAPL likes building its own tech./n<neu> @ditlevfriis I think they need to focus on boosting their subscription revenues and follow the footsteps of $AAPL/n<neu> @DavesNotLeaving @AlexDaApe @unusual_whales Like i said, they already know how retail feels about those 2 stocks. Surely they care more what people think about $AAPL $TSLA $F $AMD etc.../n<neu> @jablamsky @PatternProfits I remember doing a blog post in October 2019 on why $AAPL should buy $PTON üòÇ/n<pos> @PatternProfits That was my dream acquisition in 2020. I still think it makes a ton of sense, and significantly more likely than $AAPL./n<neu> $SPY $TSLA $AAPL In the past I've asked "How much should you tip your lambo salesman?"  
 
Today I ask, "How much should you tip the guy that shows up to repossess your Lambo?/n<neu> $SPY $HOOD $AAPL My sources tell me Robinhood in talks with Blippi about doing a tutorial video series about buying put options./n<neu> I'd expect the specter of a $ATVI $MSFT tie up to push $TTWO shareholders to want more scale in an arms race, so odd to see that spread widening a bit today. On $ATVI, seems the antitrust scrutiny has been all on platforms (Sony, $AAPL, Steam), not publishers,¬†2//n<neu> @dyer440 I'm watching $AAPL pretty closely though. I think those megacap names need to sell off before we make a short term bottom./n<neu> I mean maybe the Fed's plan is to just have everything correct but $AAPL. Just keep that sucker propped up and that passive investing bubble problem is gone! üòâ/n<neg> I don‚Äôt know what has to happen for people to stop buying dips in $Tsla and $aapl/n<neu> @junkbondinvest I think $AAPL can replicate 90% of $PTON internally without spending $15b. 

Also, for whatever reason the deal everyone wants to happen usually doesn't./n<neg> The markets are down, and rather than panic sell like the majority of you simpletons.. I‚Äôm going to double down on my portfolio $ETH $BTC $SQ $AAPL  $TSLA/n<neu> Doc.@silberschmelzer and I welcome the sell-off in large mkt cap stocks ($AAPL, $MSFT, $GS, $JPM) because the money got concentrated in "safe stocks".

"Buy and forget" index investors will get tested.

Small cap growth stocks investors already got tested to the breaking point./n<neu> Not even checking anything right now lol just relaxing, I have a list of a few stocks that I‚Äôll check towards the end of the dayüíØ 

$BBIG
$F
$LCID
$MSFT
$AAPL
$SNAP
$TWTR 
$FB

Etc‚Ä¶ what are you guys watching?üëÄ/n<neu> @agnostoxxx If $AAPL closes below $169.96, then finally all of the heavy weights are trading below the 21d SMMA, i.e. momentum is gone. Will be popcorn time then./n<pos> @TradrNate I love scalping $AAPL üëåüèΩ/n<neu> I think at some point we get a tech bounce in the mega caps and those need to be re-shorted at higher levels when they start to roll over again. $QQQ $MSFT $NFLX $AAPL $AMZN $FB/n<pos> @YoungEngnr It's a watchlist of tech and meme stocks that have seen huge retail interest, rather than of stocks that I think are extremely overvalued (that would include a slew of other stocks). Think AAPL and AMD are now richly valued, but not crazy overpriced./n<pos> $SPY $AAPL $BAC  Today also was a great opportunity to close out many of the covered calls I sold three weeks ago, locking in those extra premiums and reducing my costs basis in 12 different companies. üòÉ/n<neu> I haven‚Äôt been trading my watchlist as much lately, I‚Äôve been finding consistency scalping $SPY and names like $AAPL

Do you guys still want me to post a watchlist every night? If it‚Äôs helpful I will!/n<neg> @WillThrower3 @PercyCapital @PythiaR That‚Äôs the problem. We tend to look for esoteric solutions, since it can‚Äôt possibly be so simple. Reminds me of Bobby Axelrod mocking somebody for buying $AAPL. Pretty sure $AAPL wiped the floor with Axe Capital since then. üòú/n<pos> $DWAC also please follow me on TradeExchange for exact entries and exits :) (link in bio) you can take the exact entries and exits as me :) - mainly for swings 

Thanks everyone! $NVDA $DKNG $AAPL $SOFI/n<pos> I‚Äôm expecting an afternoon bounce for $AAPL - low risk high reward/n<pos> @bankrollstockz i did $aapl puts and worked well, this time/n<pos> @grassosteve $AAPL and $PTON make a ton of sense! Health/Fitness, wearables, music and monetization of that huge subscriber base!!/n<neg> Been shorting the $XLK holdings for like a week now but made a mistake with a long $AAPL position.  I don‚Äôt see bull setups./n<neu> @Post_Market @MadThunderdome @GavinSBaker Or it‚Äôs just 3 hours into it and the co needs to submit a merger for review bf the govnt can reject it.

But‚Ä¶duopoly?
EA, ATVI, MSFT, SNE, NTDOY, AAPL, &amp; GOOG, w 5 of those taking platform access fees.

I bet MSFT tries to position it as competitive against Apple. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> @blueshirt_omaha lol short aapl is the only thing that really excites me right now/n<neu> @WholeMarsBlog I think Project Titan will take over üòâ $aapl/n<neu> @grassosteve MSFT is paying $95 &amp; ATVI is trading around $12 below that right now.  Isn't this a gift of $12?  I guess there's a chance the deal won't go through?  AAPL will take out SNAP.  Mark my words on that./n<neg> @JTSEO9 All this and Tesla still is over 1,000‚Ä¶ STILL! Unbelievable‚Ä¶ I wish I shorted $ARKK but instead have shorted $QQQ which can‚Äôt be glorified until both $AAPL and $TSLA get whacked back 20% and 40% respectively/n<neu> @NapkinCapital @viggy_krishnan The high grow names dropped first. Now it's the big techs' ( $AAPL, $AMZN, $FB, $GOOG and $MSFT) time to drop. After that I think S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq will form the bottoms. Note the big techs have more weight on S&amp;P compared to Nasdaq (which also have $TSLA, $NVDA etc.)/n<neu> @InfinityTradesX For comparisons I've been checking the YTD, 6m &amp; 1yr change of share price.   Interesting to compare the take downs.  $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $GOOG only AMZN that actually has a flesh wound./n<neu> Market feel ? longs AAPL,MSFT,TGT,CGC,X,XMTR,DEN,shorts ARHS,GME,AMC,HOOD,ARKK (small)..under water in all longs..shorts working/n<neu> @alec_zamora What you think about $AAPL I got them going back to $168 this week?/n<neu> ‚ÄúDevelop success from failures.

But with AAPL MSFT and TSLA pushing seems doubtful/n<neu> @fatbabyfunds Only said I slightly disagree. 

$AAPL is a good example of the exception to the idea that Conten is King. This could be because of the close ecosystem they have created.

I don't believe there is an example within the gaming hardware side. I believe gaming is the on-ramp to VR./n<pos> $AAPL looks solid intraday here. 172.5-173 is big R but I like the smaller time frame structure here./n<pos> @MidoriCapital You bet your sweet ass I did!  $AAPL scalp on the trend up off the 20ema.  Now off to take a kid to the Dr!/n<pos> Closed my bearish position in $AAPL and my bullish position in $GLD. Overall a green day.

I've just been amazed that PTON can have this many subs and lose money hand over fist. The internals are terrible.

Only reason why $LCID looks good is because market makers are trying to pump this thing to burn weekly shorts and puts. 

Permabulls/pumpers are posting false links that $LCID is partnering up with $AAPL or that the Saudis said they won't sell./n<neg> @Cryptobullza @TheCryptoLark $AAPL has been very slow in implementing the newest tech advancements over the last few years. I don't think they would venture into something quite risky and unregulated such as #crypto. They will take their time, analyze whether and when it makes sense and then do it right./n<pos> @OptionsAlgoGuy Good Q.  That could work too. I have a dividend income goal to hit first. 
$MSFT $AVGO $AAPL have yielded &gt;20% ROI/n<pos> @viral_mewada @ItsSqueezy You can do it on any stock but it works better on the indexes and large caps. I use it on $SPY, the Qs, $AAPL, etc. Turn on the ORB indicator and see how your favorite stocks react!/n<neu> The year got off to a shaky start for the #growthstocks. However, the qualities of #bigtech stood out. The value of #GOOGL, #AAPL, #MSFT, #AMZN, and #META has retreated only slightly since early November. I expect the correction will be temporary for the big tech players./n<pos> I‚Äôm taking some profits in AAPL today. If it goes higher, it goes higher. Still have a good position. If it goes lower I use the profits I took to but it at a lower price.

I also like $GS $MDT and $ABBV - all over 2% right now.

Last few days in AAPL is a good example of that./n<neu> @anthony_einhorn I'm with ya. Weak consumer spending in Q4 coupled with supply chain issues is bound to have an impact on $AAPL's Q4 ER. Also this happens to be their most profitable quarter by seasonality so unless we see iPhone and wearable sales blow out we are due for a tight correction./n<neu> @EricJhonsa in a higher/rising rate environment, i'm not so certain

Around 11 years ago when I was 21 I bought $15,000 of AAPL stock at around $105 per share.

AAPL is not in the business of losing money, and they're not going to buy a fad./n<neg> @Post_Market @PreparedRemarks For Grantham to say 50% fall requires substantial cuts in Big tech given their share in the market.

If it were to fall to those levels it would buy of the century./n<neg> Months like this one are why I stick to leaps, instead of trying to trade close dated options. 

2022 has been an absolute turd so far, but I don‚Äôt have to bail out on my positions because I have time for things to go my way.

I am still not convinced about the value proposition of buying $PTON at current price. 

1. Turnarounds rarely turnaround

2. The TAM for sticky active asses (people who workout)/n<neu> @cperruna I consider FANG to be a "brand," not an acronym. It refers to the biggest and highest quality names.

Trained &amp; Educated there = on underlying valuations. I also manage private equity. 

There are some who monitor most major stocks. My focus is on those I trade and evaluate. Underlying is a deep dive &amp; only so much time to review./n<pos> @MacFanJohn3 I'm certainly not the top guy out there for underlying (I appear that way compared to the FURUs though) but I'm trained &amp; educated there.

With that in mind, I like $AAPL much better than $QCOM through the coming months.

I agree they've been given the benefit of the doubt a bit too often. They're not as consistent as, say, $AAPL.

I mean, they're back at Dec 2020 levels now though, that's a lot!/n<pos> With $GS down and $AAPL holding up. I am net ok. I own $PYPL and $NVDA which are also down. Real estate is insanely up. So do they for me. I would like to get more liquid though. Will refinance some real estate for liquidity./n<pos> @Biotech2k1 @DaVinENTP That's legit on $SQ!!  
Factoring in size of position, I'd say $AAPL &amp; $AMAT are about tied for my best 'tech' plays w/all-in cost basis' of $15 &amp; $11 respectively... 
$AMZN not too far behind @ $297.../n<neu> @GianniDiMattia6 I remember when Apple wasn‚Äôt in the FANG.

Ex: If I purchase $AAPL in 1990 and provided none of the above resources and held till 2022. I‚Äôve made a fantastic long term ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù, but I‚Äôm a trader, not an investor.

3/6/n<neu> @fuzziybear Monday not sure -anything can happen. There can be a rally till Wednesday Fed meeting and then go down...or the reverse. whatever happens, I see $AAPL going to that 150 sooner or later...

Ofcourse, above not financial advice/n<pos> @PikesPeakTrades Love $AAPL. I am largely exposed in them for my LT portfolio üëç

Do you think we‚Äôll get some relief bounce come next week with big tech reporting?/n<neu> @ElbakheitA No feelings üòÉü§ñ

Since algos are in control it could always go lower. Should be getting close. There aren‚Äôt any catalysts. Earnings will be important. Market needs to flush it out. If $AAPL hits the 200-day I‚Äôm sure the market would turn the other way. Doesn‚Äôt have to happen./n<neu> @serraotweets @matthewstoller Right I just got the sense from your original post that if AAPL is worth 3 trillion for instance and it sells 1% off then that 30 billion goes to somebody's pocket.  I'm just saying that money doesn't have to be conserved, it can just be worth less one day./n<neg> @InvestorJulius I know it‚Äôs incredibly boring but $AAPL still has one of the best technical charts out there.

$76M invested, 9M shares

He can own another ~6.2M shares without exceeding the 20% ownership clause.

I'm honestly not sure if this would be a big brain move or a retarded one./n<neu> @SnoozeInvestor $AAPL if I have to choose/n<neu> @SnoozeInvestor Now?  $MSFT  But I'm usually wrong, so... $AAPL.  Definitely $AAPL./n<neu> @PSalantonio @data168 Even a cash cow like a $AAPL $FB $MSFT will take it easy on buybacks if they feel like tougher times and higher rates are ahead. Look at how quickly all buybacks got paused after March 2020./n<pos> @DBookTrading I started with $AAPL $NVDA &amp; $LCID myself. Still keep an eye every day. I totally agree. Wax on, wax off.

I say again.. FUCK YOU OLD MAN!!!/n<neu> @YourBoyMilt @lilyayyo_ I still like the idea of NFLX more than AAPL. Obviously would be happy with anything that makes VIAC go up. I wish I would‚Äôve been paying attention to the AMZN MGM acquisition just to know if there were similarities there. Seems like AMZN took a big hit around that time./n<neu> @BackpackerFI I strangely suspect positive earnings out of $MSFT $AAPL/n<neg> Seeing $BTC crash is no surprise given the carnage in the markets last couple weeks...

Expecting to sell off Tuesday/n<neu> @hari_balz While $TSLA is the no-brainer short when the rug finally gets pulled out from this market, I'm also thinking "safe-haven" stocks like $AAPL could be used as funding baskets to cover losses./n<pos> @unusual_whales I have seen this movie over an over. $AAPL, MSFT beating earnings and the share price üìâ/n<pos> @amazonholder1 That‚Äôs a terrific point and great insight - and it‚Äôs not like it needs to be all or nothing - even almost from a marketing standpoint, $AAPL &amp; $MSFT enjoy benefits of being on dividend growth lists despite really low yield (I agree, buybacks much more likely)/n<neu> @d__dudley @The_RockTrading I was thinking $AAPL, but prob to the 120s if anything/n<pos> @SnoozeInvestor I prefer $AAPL but both $AAPL &amp; $MSFT are very good companies./n<pos> @BlueMoonTrades Hmm, 20% in each. Would be VGT, SQ, CRSR, AMD, and maybe FB. That‚Äôs based on me already holding TSLA and AAPL. A small cap index would be good too. If crypto I‚Äôd buy ETH. What about you @BlueMoonTrades ?/n<neu> @HoosierTrader Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm watching but if you look at the large caps like AAPL and TSLA that have held everything up they look weak and maybe an additional 5-10% lower. If that were true that would make the index a ~20% correction which isn‚Äôt over the top for me in this environment/n<neu> @cubic39834428 @TSLAFanMtl @squawksquare AAPL was not training at the same valuation as TSLA is despite its amazing future and still dropped almost 60%. I agree with your analogy though./n<neg> @riddle245 I'm a little worried on $AAPL. Stock has been on such a tear and I think the upgrade cycle is set up to underperform expectations.

I think I would pick $AAPL/n<neu> @SnoozeInvestor üëÜif they didn‚Äôt make this move I would have gone with $AAPL.

Just my opinion./n<neu> @The_RockTrading I‚Äôm not thinking $TSLA with the delivery numbers they announced unless you are just thinking next quarter forecast is low but $AAPL on the other hand with reports of less sales and reaching 3T market cap which almost signaled top of the market is possible./n<pos> @DreamBigBeBig20 I‚Äôm buying the dip in $AAPL just for you Tim Cook/n<neu> @Brandon24732790 @Jake__Wujastyk Max pain for SPY is 455 while sitting at 438. FUD from FOMC meetings concerns me although we have big companies reporting earnings this week: AAPL, TSLA, etc. If they beat I think we have upside.

MSFT AAPL and TSLA could all drop lower next week like NFLX did today. Time to eat üìâü§ë/n<pos> Got my 16" MacBook Pro tonite with M1 pro chip... great machine. $AAPL still got its groove. Nice little distraction from the market misery. 
While a good keyboard, great screen and snappy OS was all expected and taken for granted, I can't believe how impressive it sounds!/n<pos> @FyiStocks @BCalusinski @CheddarFlow Yes, I'm not making any assumptions on if it's a buy or sell but yes I do hope TSLA and giants like AAPL MSFT can help./n<neg> @TrungTPhan $AAPL wants to create their own content and would never buy $NFLX. Buying $PTON would be a huge mistake and I don‚Äôt believe they would.

however, all eyes will be on $msft $googl $aapl $amzn. those lower guidance for FY22 and don't beat EPS...then üò¨/n<neu> In my small account I‚Äôm looking at tech earnings for next week + honorable mentions. Let‚Äôs see how market treats us on Monday.

Follow me to get a pick every weekend!/n<neu> @DXYnormous That was in the stratosphere on valuation.  Great company but not one I‚Äôd look at for margin calls.  

When AAPL GOOG and gold start to go I‚Äôll take notice. 

TSLA too just because people never sell it.  Cult following./n<neu> @PositiveInvst I learned the stock can turn on a dime on a speculative $AAPL buy-out rumor.  And $PYPL is buying $PINS and $NFLX is buying $FUBO - spread the word!/n<neu> @STXRBOY999 Thoughts on $AAPL?  I‚Äôm looking to add more to my port at the dip./n<pos> @Bonecondor @jmccart10 @ShitFund Valuation, Chinese Manufacturing risk.  3.3% vs 4.1% earnings yield.  Give me $AAPL at $135 and my vote changes.  Greatest ecosystem in the world/n<neu> @MarketRebels No way . $NFLX has a better chance üòÖ imagine ! I mean all the product comes with a screen already . &amp; $AAPL could just make their own üçè/n<pos> @amitisinvesting I prefer $MSFT at around 223-245 or $TSLA at 740-800. Both are expanding margin business with stronger growth than $AAPL . At the aforementioned price, their margin of safety pretty much equals current $PLTR condition for 5 years/n<neg> @JessicaRawbit @DagnumPI At no point did I say it's not a bubble lmao. Gymnastics on your part

Look at Netflix, PTON which was relentlessly shilled by the people of MSNBC, AAPL down 10 percent on the month, MSFT as well, Siemens, Carvana, Shopify. Are you this uninformed? Go do some research lmao/n<neu> @amitisinvesting And now I just sold my $AAPL for $PLTR/n<neu> @JoTrader4 Not buying any stock like SHOP MELI CMG AMZN .

AAPL never did much beyond acqui-hires / strategic bolt-ons. 

So how many deals would GOOG / FB / AMZN be doing? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs hugely material. 

Although it might do more damage to sentiment./n<neu> @munster_gene I think AAPL earnings will be on the same line/n<neg> I see many GURU became a bearish !! I have been bearish since last 2 months !! They were always bullish and long term holder ..

BTW: $AAPL has a gap on 7/31/2020 at $97. 

I don't see $AAPL getting hammered incessantly for months to fill that bullshit?

@GaryGensler 
#AMCNOTLEAVING/n<neu> A lot of irrational selling going on now $AAPL $AMZN $GOOGL $FB Each are fairly or undervalued at these levels. That being said, I will wait for further drops if it comes and load up. Zoom out‚Ä¶the world is not ending./n<neu> @kgopinion @Dreamer08653284 Cool. I had the opportunity to buy an Airstream for $4 K. I regret listening to my ex ever. She also convinced me not to put $25 K of mad money into AAPL when it was at $17./n<neg> $TSLA reports this week on 26th. Buckle fucking up. It could be another bloodbath for the markets. Even missing $AAPL scares me less. All of a sudden #crypto doesn‚Äôt look that risky./n<pos> @CanteringClark 2. Looking at next weeks earnings, I predict $MSFT will not miss and they will give us a great peek inside the state of the economy given their size.  And $IBM, $LOGI and $AAPL. Maybe $AAPL misses but the rest? And $TSLA well, who knows. I am bullish, this was overdone imo./n<neu> @ItsKingsBruh yup I got a spy call‚Ä¶ tech earnings as well for MSFT and AAPL. might play tesla puts tho/n<neu> When will growth bottom?

Average iPhone use is &gt;270 min/user/day. Overall PTON consumption is 11 million min/day vs. iPhone at 324,000 million min/day. PTON market cap is $727/min of use vs. $AAPL at ~$7.1/min. Hence PTON=100x AAPL./n<neu> Big BIG week for tech.  Either it‚Äôs stabilising of a catalyst for another leg down. $MSFT Tues, $intc snd $tsla Weds and $aapl Thurs.  I can hardly bear to imagine any misses amongst those four give fragile state of sentiment./n<neu> MINI-WATCHLIST üìà

$APPL | We‚Äôve seen Apple sell off hard to the low 160 range. 

We have earnings report on THURSDAY. 

I‚Äôve been trading $AAPL 5 years and there‚Äôs typically a pre-earnings run on the stock, which IMO is even more likely after a $21 sell off from recent highs./n<neu> @Southwe46368128 @danielpkkim not a hard rule for profitable bigcaps, msft was one of only names to have a bid on tuesday, day after atvi announcement. idk how quiet period ahead of aapl earnings would affect this, but if they reach a deal its material and must be announced immediately regardless, i think?/n<neu> @data168 $csco p/e in 2000 was above 196! aapl is 28.

yeah wtf could go wrong, this week is gonna be volatilty as shit i think lmao/n<pos> @ShaunClarke_ I‚Äôll stick with the big boys here - MSFT, META &amp; AAPL/n<neu> @MasaSonCap Believe key question is which of those six is a ‚Äúmust have‚Äù.  Today can argue NFLX is, HBO Max or Disney+ nipping at the heels though.  Curious how they would stack up on a must have basis or not for a non-US viewer.  Hard for me to know. AMZN diff strategy and AAPL not there yet/n<pos> @LadeBackk 230 on $MSFT and 138 on $AAPL are interesting to me for earnings plays.

And that is coming from an Android guy./n<neu> @STOCKMASTERJAY They‚Äôre I‚Äôll find thier way into aapl üòÜ/n<neu> 5 stocks I'm watching this week for a move before or after earnings are:

$MSFT
$BA
$TSLA
$INTC
$AAPL/n<neu> @Alex__Pitti Tough conditions ! We should hopefully bottom soon nas made 1300 new lows on Friday .that to me is capitulation people think the doe and naz have to be down 2000/1000 respectively! That may not happen bec stocks like aapl Fb Msft are like banks üè¶ and aren‚Äôt rolling hard/n<neu> Earnings coming up along with the FEDS talking:

$TSLA $AAPL $IBM $MSFT $INTC $BRO $PETS $SMBK $ZION $STLD

I am watching $MSFT with expected YOY Growth of 12%+. 

$TSLA as well with an expected YOY Growth of 180%+ üëÄ

Let‚Äôs see what the FEDS say ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> Let me just say this: You won‚Äôt see some of the FANG stocks recover in the next 20 years, especially $AAPL $GOOGL $AMZN.  Correction of big techs has just started. Some advantages they have over growth names which are buybacks and monopoly will be gone./n<neu> @jimcramer LOL you think i'm going to sell my #Bitcoin to buy $MSFT $AAPL and $GOOG ? what drugs are you on ? üôÑüòÜ/n<neg> @Dividend_Dollar A or D. 

Here‚Äôs a question and I may just be dumb‚Ä¶

With aapl and msft making up 8-15% of most etf‚Äôs handling the market generally‚Ä¶ how can you not just keep dumping money into them?/n<pos> @TicTocTick I mainly watch $AAPL and $MSFT and cycle the others.  This will help me greatly/n<neg> @CrimsonCrus @AaronHorrocks @bob_boogaard @Boojahideen Why did you let me sell the 10,000 shares of AAPL I owed in 1994, dad!?/n<pos> Took out the big ones for weekly updates:

$FB
$NVDA
$AAPL
$TSLA
$MSFT
$AMZN

Shoot me requests if you've got them. I'm still setting up intradays for the week. Interesting market, as a bounce seems likely, but Fed speaks Wed. Harder to predict, but nailed last week. On we go./n<pos> @BackpackerFI Personally I like $SOL better than $LUNA 

I think $LCID should be in EVs

Would add $AAPL to metaverse

Maybe synbio doesn‚Äôt quite belong in this list yet but it‚Äôs a big trend I think people are sleeping on and $DNA + $TWST I think are big big opportunity right now/n<pos> @Logos_LP $GOOG, $AAPL, $COST. All dominant with wide moats. $NVDA and $AMZN honorable mentions. 

Two others I love: $AXON (body cameras) and $RMD (sleep apnea machines). Axon has virtually no competition in a critical space. Resmed the leader in a market that's still largely untapped./n<neu> @stocktrader300 Oh it was mentioned. I agree $AAPL will take one look at their disaster of book keeping and say NTY.

Besides they are already taking them on w/ their own fitness app/n<neu> @OptionsMike The only rumor I saw was AAPL. No chance LULU buys PTON. I also think less than 1% change AAPL buys them./n<neu> @quinnscomments I read years ago that the way to beat the market is to invest in just a few successful companies, e.g., AAPL, MSFT, or the like, and watch them carefully. High diversification guarantees mediocrity./n<pos> Three huge earnings to start the week, going to give a huge indicator for me on whether the next few weeks are moving bearish or bullish. 

$TSLA, $AAPL, $MSFT

Let's chart out their key levels./n<neu> @garyblack00 I am expecting that this week $TLSA, $MSFT and $AAPL reports will set the bottom for this correction./n<neg> @9Jzs @BrianCanadien $aapl can easily lose another 50% from here. $nflx just did. I don‚Äôt follow the other fangs closely but I see no reason why they won‚Äôt see serious multiple compression as the bubble continues deflating. We‚Äôre only in the 2-3rd inning of this bear market./n<pos> With valuations of many tech companies cut in half (or at least be 1/3), it‚Äôs the perfect time for cash-rich companies such as $MSFT, $AAPL, $AMZN to go on shopping tour 

I bet we will see some large M&amp;A in 2022/n<pos> @technologypoet I'm in it for both. AAPL is both great tech and investment. That's how we should view cryptos./n<pos> gm who‚Äôs ready for an exciting week ahead?

We got FOMC, MSFT/AAPL/TSLA reporting, the $MAGIC unlock, all within the next 3-4 days. Feels like ‚Äúguidance‚Äù going forward will be even more important than usually. I can see us range bound with a slight positive tilt unless üá∑üá∫ üí£ üá∫üá¶./n<neu> ‚Ä¢a stock split will happen when and if management deems it worthy and in the best interest of the company, not investors.

‚Ä¢I personally like the comparison between $tsla and $aapl in the sense that they changed the market forever./n<neg> @Frances_Coppola @JudeJudeUST @yemxgrunt I don‚Äôt get itüòÇ

If you buy an mAsset you don‚Äôt have the Asset. What you do have is the price exposure. Which, in no way makes it fake.

And if they both are up 3-5% this week, that might be enough to prop the market up a little bit longer. 

Not betting on it, but it's possible/n<pos> @1BethDutton I think the large caps are safest atm $TSLA $SPY $AAPL  probably those I'd go for but if we are talking more volatile stuff I'd look at $QTNT $ANF $MX $MBHCF $FCEL

$FCEL probably the best imo/n<neu> 2 swings heading into tomorrow I need $aapl to break $160/n<neu> @BMT094 @DoctorJack16 Not once in a lifetime but very infrequent. Just have to be paying attention. I was in  early with Amzn and aapl as well. I put them in the same category as tsla. Massively transformational companies.just hold on and ignore short term./n<neu> @JRogrow When it comes to gaming, I have $AMD $AAPL $GOOGL $MSFT $NFLX $NVDA $RBLX $SE and $U as an exposure on my list. I do however think GeForce Now doesn't get as much attention as it should. This could be big for Nvidia as I can see many players prefer streaming over owning the HW./n<neu> @Cristal_Irma31 When panic selling happens PE doesn‚Äôt matter, I recall $AAPL PE was 6 and it was still selling off üòÇ/n<pos> @InnocenceCapit1 @BahamaBen9 OK, then you won't mind me responding in kind. 

30 yrs studying Buffet, and you didn't learn shit. Concentrating into 1 co. is his exact advice to small investors.

Disagree if you like, but it works great for me and armies of long AAPL and TSLA investors./n<neu> To be honest, $AAPL maintained it‚Äôs stronghold on its consumers even as Android caught up to iOS feature-wise. The savior for $AAPL imho was its cult following. And $TSLA has a similar cult going for it but I don‚Äôt think it will be enough over the next 5 years/n<neg> @ayeshatariq I'm actually more focused on the earnings than FOMC. 

If $AAPL and $TSLA disappoint, expect carnage./n<neg> @kosmarr @ajitosu Man $aapl is crazy expensive. I see those same forward projections.

If aapl is bad on Thursday, there's a lot of room to fall/n<neu> Looking over some charts this weekend ‚Ä¶. And I‚Äôm afraid we still got a lot of gaps to fill on some of these tech stocks ‚Ä¶ however the good news is $AAPL which is essentially the $SPY to me hasn‚Äôt been as hard ‚Ä¶ once that falls or gets wrecked then I see sum more downside/n<neg> @DivesTech I think AAPL might disappoint with lower than expected iPhone 13 sales./n<neu> @TrustYaJuJu When I figure it out it‚Äôll be MSFT AMD SQ AAPL/n<neu> @David_Tracey I dunno. I see a lot of bears resigned to expecting a big rally after every short drawdown. Surely the recent weakness is overdone. But AAPL is still worth $2.7tn just 3-1/2 years after hitting the $1tn mark. And POS companies like SHOP are worth $110bn. Too much fluff./n<neu> @RealTimeTradez I bet is going to be $AAPL/n<neg> @volpompilano @Mike_Hunt_Sr @BankofVol @VolatilityQ @WifeyAlpha Ya wifey was on top of that and held....

But will that app save your life when you're lost in the wilderness? I think not. #SFvsGB #NFLPlayoffs $AAPL/n<neu> Shorting $AAPL and $TSLA paying off nicely. What else do I supposed to do if SEC @GaryGensler rewards mobs by completely ignoring scams and pump and dumps in the market./n<pos> @BretKenwell Thanks for sharing, Bret! It was helpful to read how you prepared and reacted. I traded $F, $AMD, $AAPL so the similarities and differences in our processes was enlightening./n<neu> Okay okay. I‚Äôve had some messages because I‚Äôm short in $MSFT. Truthfully idc. I don‚Äôt go shorting blindly into stocks that I‚Äôm swinging. I don‚Äôt go shorting $BBIG.

There is potentially more downside but trying to DCA in incrementally in the long term investment account/n<pos> $SPY $QQQ #NASDAQ100 

As a trader, it is pain to watch red days continuously. However, quickly cut loss, and reenter with better one. 

Currently I see both $AAPL and $TGT, relatively stronger than rest of the market. Loaded Feb calls./n<neg> @alexroznowski @SpacGuru $FB 
$MSFT

Bottom likely in when most big tech is down 20-25%

Early 2022 could be max pain but present some incredible buying opps. I‚Äôm looking to add to $GOOGL and $AAPL./n<neu> @Logos_LP At these prices, I would buy none. There are some hot pockets in a handful of stocks in sectors like metal and healthcare etc. But Tech moves markets and has been overvalued for a while. Anyone could check their book values to find this truth. 5y plan AAPL FB maybe TSLA./n<neu> A popular question, I am in deep red down 30-40-50%, should I cut loss or hold. It depends if you are in a company that are growing with huge demands and an industry leader I would just hold like $MSFT $AAPL $GOOG $AMZN $TSLA.  If you have stocks you are fine, if you have options/n<neg> @CharizardBlasts My fault y‚Äôall! I meant the 100 EMA! 

$AAPL üçé/n<neu> I have to constantly remind myself to not go all in. Only risk 2-3% on any trade, be it day or swing. Cash is king. Only invest in sure things. Right now, there are none.

Can't say the same for $TSLA/n<neg> The highest cap stocks, $AAPL, $MSFT, $GOOGL, and $AMZN have not reached their support areas, suggesting the index should move lower. I will wait for the confirmation, not anticipation./n<neg> Call me crazy but the fed is crashing the markets intentionally. America is the strongest economy and will recover first. China has massive debt and a 40 year bubble that's popping. How do you remain #1, crash the rest of the world. $spy $dia $qqq $vxx $aapl $nvda $msft $amzn $fb/n<neg> With the refurb market being in the billions, $AAPL will fall. With @jimcramer recommending $DIS, I‚Äôd put it as well. The market is crumbling like a muffin that‚Äôs been sitting out for months./n<neg> @bustersdad @DanielTNiles I think it is likely that AAPL either misses earnings or lowers guidance when they report on Thursday. I expect the stock to go down 5-10%./n<neu> Thursday after market close earnings

$AAPL could be the catalyst .

Big miss I'm predicting./n<neu> @SpecInsights I'm all there with you on short $AAPL. I also recognize Mr Putin's ability to calculate his odds well in advance./n<neu> Thursday after market close earnings

$AAPL could be the catalyst .

Big miss I'm predicting./n<neu> @JGInvestments1 Thanks. Yes, I've been buying puts on many overvalued small-mid cap growth stocks and large caps like $AAPL, which was a screaming short at $180. 

I hedge my risk by adding some long exposure. I've been net short since the last few days of December./n<neu> @certfdgammaboy @JPATrades @unusual_whales 142-147 is my target range for post ER move, I suspect AAPL will move similar to semis, so if bearish on semis might want to get into put positions early./n<neg> @InkoCapital @BoilerWest Man, I hope it works out,

The ‚ÄúN‚Äù just shit down it‚Äôs leg 20% Friday,

Amazon broke support.

AAPL might become Atlas.

Apple better not shrug./n<neu> @TeslaAndDoge I don‚Äôt know you but get that your Dad wishes best for you.  He is coming at it for a trader standpoint.

My late father did this to me some years ago.  I had all my money in one stock.. AAPL.. all his investor buddies told him I was wrong.. so I listened to him. NFA./n<pos> So many bearish setups in the market, on especially the major tech stocks

TSLA has a H&amp;S 
AAPL has a H&amp;S
MSFT has triple top

What I‚Äôm really looking forward to seeing is MSFT earnings. Technicals say puts, but if they give good guidance after buying ATVI it could bounce/n<neu> @Real_Futurist This is a common opinion right now on twitter but i do agree that $AMZN, $AAPL need to correct a bit more which can bring about more uncertainty.

I think we bottom at the end of Feb/early march if inflation appears to be slowing down going into Fed meeting./n<neu> @anthony_einhorn Bull trap. I agree. I am trying to think what the next put will be after NFLX. I am thinking AAPL. Current share price is more than the 160 which was after announcing releasing a self-driving car in 2025. 5G phones... ppl slowly realizing they don't need it.../n<neg> I‚Äôd never wanna do this normally but 

If we open extremely green tomorrow shorting $Aapl with some 2/4 puts into their earnings might be really really lucrative. 

I am a huge apple bull but based on $NFLX seems like any miss on guidance at all just obliterates growth stocks/n<neu> I‚Äôm watching #tech #oil and #banks sectors tomorrow $AAPL $MSFT $CVX $XOM $BAC/n<neg> @jaredthetrader @international_j @TMLTrader I went all in on bonds in 2007. I didn‚Äôt know how to short anything, and probably would have screwed up anyway.

I loaded up AAPL in 2009 at ~$5 split adjusted. 

Timing was perfect, but na√Øve luck. I‚Äôm as clueless as anyone about future crashes./n<neu> Potentially looking at spreading around some puts on a few big tech names with earnings this week. If $NFLX is any indication, a chink in the armor has severe consequences in this market.

#Bitcoin #Crypto #burgerking $AAPL $TSLA $SPY $QQQ $FB $SNAP $TWTR $GOOG $WMT $AMZN $MSTR $GME $VIAC $SDC $F $DD $SBUX $MCD/n<neg> @MWM76 I need $aapl and $nvda to go green.  The latter especially as I opened my position too early and im down a good amount.  I feel like $nvda is a great company but their ARM news isnt helping./n<pos> @Crussian17 Yep, I think positive in immediate short term from  $AAPL and $TSLA earnings, but I'm pessimistic for the next few weeks.  There will be more $NFLX  like adjustments which will bring index pressure.
As always though I'm long term optimistic, so I'm doing a lot more buying now./n<neg> @CharityHedge I am simply not convinced yesterday was the bottom; ARKK has likely bottomed, but not sure about NQ (AAPL and SOXX‚Ä¶); this is tricky, yesterday many went long end of day and has been put into difficulty today; and general thinking is JPow opens his mouth ‚Äî&gt; rally‚Ä¶/n<neg> Back to Green what is even happening üòÇüòÇ

Side note, I do know me watching my Apple $AAPL stock go up and down with no plans to buy or sell is literally pointless/n<neu> Today I added to:
$AAPL - Apple
$VIS - Vanguard Industrials Index Fund ETF
$RWL - Invesco S&amp;P 500 Revenue ETF
$SCHD - Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF

What did you add to today? #investing #fintwit/n<neu> @Tricky_OW @Mystifiken1 MSFT is juggernaut I think they beat too. Even AAPL has succumb to their prowess and started heavy integrations with the MSFT enterprise ecosystem./n<pos> Bought my first share of $AAPL today.  Made a cool $3 from mid-day.  Nothing to brag about but I‚Äôm excited nonetheless #investing #stocks #Apple #wealth/n<pos> @BroadStreetOil @CL_fTrader To me looks like the shorts tried lower and got caught when the vol sellers, put profit takers came in and some of the bigger players continued covering more shorts ... $AAPL been  good indicators through orderflow and algo levels/n<pos> $SPY trend a lil tired. Ticks basically positive.  I think we have more if 5 NASDAQ HORSEMEN contributed $AMZN $NVDA $MSFT $AAPL/n<neu> @baebackup Yeah i'm avoiding AAPL/AMZN until we see a definite uptrend.  Even if we miss the first 6 or 7% there will still be plenty of up to go.  But it might be awhile./n<neu> This dataset samples 137 trading days, so a little over 6 months worth of data. I looked at SPY, AAPL, PLTR, and GS to look at some data between both OI PCR and ole‚Äô reliable.

Why these? Well
1) Index
2) Related to index well
3) Call heavy ticker
4) Wide PCR oscillations/n<neu> @TNomone I always have a workspace open with AAPL FB AMZN GOOGL NVDA MSFT TSLA and QQQ. Watch the trends and directions and premarket levels and demand and support zones/n<neu> @BackpackerFI What u buying Danny? I grabbed more AAPL and TSLA today/n<pos> @baebackup It is.  I still have the TSLA i bought, but also bought some AAPL yesterday and punted this morning.  Took it up the ass on that one.  Check out LMT though.  And at some point crypto and crypto miners will begin a massive recovery./n<neu> ‚ÄúBecoming a millionaire is not the end goal; your growth and development en-route is what matters.‚Äù

FOMC Powell wont screw the market:) $spy/n<neu> Tesla and Apple only down less than 1% now. Rates going higher and retail going all in for the 12th time this month confirmed. Down we go. 

Now I just need to find out what Cramer‚Äôs club bought yesterday and today to short. 

$TSLA $AAPL $SPX $QQQ $SPY/n<neg> Dumb but I can't think of anything smarter to say - it feels like post MSFT, AAPL, TSLA earnings; and FOMC we might retrace back to last week's highs; or it is so bad that we get a flash crash, and March FOMC doesn't do rate increases. Either way, we know this week./n<pos> Given the high growth expectations of #aapl #tsla #amzn #googl #nflx moving forward - and their significant index composition, I expect an equal weighted basket #RSP to outperform #SPX over the next 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods/n<pos> The new Apple Watch is an absolutely phenomenal product. If I wasn‚Äôt in a hole with stocks today I would probably be bidding on $AAPL calls. I underestimated Tim Cook from the start./n<neu> @mailboxmoney6 I think a lot will also depend on tech earnings. $MSFT, $AAPL, $AMZN, $GOOGL. Even minor disappointments will get sold hard./n<neg> If you block out the f*cking noise, you'll notice massive green hammers yday WITH volume followed by an inside day across many tickers. Seems contructive to me after a 10% move off the highs. $SPY $TSLA $AMZN $AAPL $AMD $NVDA $MSFT/n<neu> I'm just looking to buy puts at this point. I guess I animorphed into a bear. $SPY $TSLA $AAPL $WISH/n<neg> @JPATrades Rode SPY down 2x up 1x and then AAPL up because that SPY wick is killing my charts and I can't deal with it/n<neu> $MSFT Earnings After Hour and Fed Decision /FOMC tmro
I expect these two to be key for markets followed by $AAPL earnings
Although Seeing choppiness into FOMC but not sure what worse can come out of Fed after this big drop.
Market needs certainty/clarity, maybe Powell obliges.!/n<neu> Will $AAPL buy $PTON? Acquisition makes sense to me../n<pos> $aapl buyout $viac it makes so much sense/n<neu> I believe I just heard someone on CNBC suggest that the Fed needs to bailout the stock market if $AAPL trades down to a 20x PE.

EPS the past year: +71%
Currently trades at 28x this +71% eps #
Consensus EPS growth estimates:
2022: 2%

$aapl $msft $pltr $tsla #puts/n<pos> @RihardJarc Pretty remarkable $GOOG has been able to fight that kind of headwind &amp; still provide very solid return. Especially true in light of $AAPL &amp; $MSFT's multiple expansion over this time. Also makes you wonder if there is now upside optionality to $GOOG (Cloud) &amp; $FB's (Ecom) multiple/n<neg> I have to see $AAPL get its crap together on the day to get bullish for the day. Apple is the confirmation the others are the hints./n<neg> @MidoriCapital when do you see them going to their normal price? i‚Äôm getting stun locked out of 3/4ths of potential plays lol. i‚Äôm stuck playing AAPL and XOM because they have half decent prem/n<neu> @TraderBJones I think with a lot of big names like $MSFT $aapl and $tsla reporting earnings, it might cause a big shift in how the $spy or $qqq move in upcoming days/n<neu> @PondSagg @WSJ We agree it was overvalued last year over $300. I like it under $200 but it probably goes lower near term. Longer term I think, it gets over a $100 billion market cap but we shall see. Dominant provider of audio. It's an afterthought for Aapl and Goog./n<neu> @KentsBrokerage My neighbor bought a bunch of $amc at highs üòÇ. I told him buy $aapl üòÇ/n<neg> @SamanthaLaDuc @KimbleCharting I expect a dud from $AAPL today. Any guesses for the rest of the week?/n<pos> @PondSagg AAPL is way too expensive but SPOT is the one ARKK name I like. Trades at a price/sales of less than 4. Taking over podcasting and music. Buying back shares. Has a visionary leader - Ek - Bol. My kids make fun of me for listening to radio but I am mostly on SPOT/n<neu> @ChartGuys I‚Äôve been DCA‚Äôing into my M1 pie since about 405 on SPY, all long term positions. 55 holdings, KO, PNG, HD, AAPL, MSFT, etc.. happy to have the discounts but kinda tired of buying the dip./n<neg> hot take: I don't actually like trading $AAPL. any time i have it on the wl i dont usually trade it/n<neu> I've got a -9deg descending channel on the $AAPL 5min, took spy calls expecting a break of range/n<neu> I've got a coworker that tells me $AAPL is in a bubble and $MSFT is his biggest position. $SQQQ/n<neg> @punchcardinvest @MasaSonCap I can see a scenario arising (obviously the bull case) where $NFLX scale allows them to bleed competitors like $AMZN bled their competitors until many cry uncle.  However, unfortunately for $NFLX - $AMZN, $AAPL, $DIS a lot harder to bleed out than $AMZN comp. back in day./n<neg> I hope all these over priced overbought tech stocks go back down to their true book value per share that reflects their earnings and the true valuations $fb $snap $amzn $aapl $nflx $goog harvesting your data should be a crime/n<neu> $AAPL may fill the gap but with all the fear in the market it may not, I may close at the top of the gap. You can only see the gap on like the 5min so it‚Äôs not a strong gap./n<neg> The worst case sceneario I see for $SPY is when $AAPL bottoms at $145/n<pos> I've keep telling y'all that something BiG is coming! $AAPL, $NVDA, $NFLX, even the Elon and his brother now what is coming!/n<neu> $AAPL sees 82 bullish options orders worth $4,940,290.

I get the IB business but what value can you bring as the 197th analyst following Apple? Sell-side should focus on the small or mid-cap space where equities can be greatly mispriced./n<pos> The $AAPL gods were mad at me for buying puts yesterday. I guess.

I love you all! üíô/n<neg> @MorTre4 @classicyeet @BitcoinWaifu @disclosetv Dude do you want me to spell it out for you lol. crypto assets serve the same function as stocks such as AAPL and TSLA. They are investments not currencies fo spend. Gosh people are dense./n<neg> @KingShard1 I am feeling kind of stupid selling my aapl puts yesterday :(/n<neu> @elhesh008 Yes, I always check my watchlist from the previous day. And since stocks I look at every day. Like AMC AMD NIO AAPL TSLA etc/n<neg> @MissyLongSoxx I see it as mixed. FB and GOOGL true monopolies. AAPL mixed due to some supply chain issues. MSFT inline. All are a little pricey if growth isn't pretty solid but online services more durable./n<neu> @CNBCFastMoney Putting AAPL in the same box as SNAP, TWTR is even a STRETCH for Dan "I Have No Clients" Nathan, not sure but I am guessing, AAPL has enough "CASH" to buy the other companies in your 20% down RANT!/n<neu> @NayutSitachitt I hear you; it's true I have ~30% exposure to big tech (FB, GOOG, AMZN, and AAPL when I consider it through my BRK position) and that does dissuade me somewhat from making it even larger. 

Btw I bought SHOP at ~15-16x NTM Sales and it's tiny position compared to big tech./n<pos> @LSValue @JerryCap Agree no one. To me $AAPL makes more sense. 

They acquiesced to Roku on Apple TV expansion. And this is their way to further compete with Google by moving into a "new vertical" in CTV. 

Also Apple originals + The Roku Channel = accelerating chord cutters. Ad rev would be üìà/n<neg> @Steve_Wags3 $PLNHF! I thought the DD on it was solid and I bought into it.

It will all depend on Boomer vs Millennial flows.

$AAPL et al says boomers aren't the sellers yet.

$TSLA barely down from ATH says Millennials aren't giving up on the ponzi's yet./n<pos> @JerryCap $AAPL or $NFLX makes too much sense/n<neu> Tomorrow I‚Äôm ready to buy more $msft and I‚Äôm waiting on $aapl to fall a little more to the $140 range or lower/n<neg> @BahamaBen9 agree. my guess is $tsla earnings beat already baked into current price as core delivery numbers are already public, $aapl will disappoint on supply chain issues / outlook + folks consuming less in q4. i nibbled today but preparing for further decline./n<pos> @sysop408 @tanoaksam During the hype a lot of companies will seem like great investments, and those are hard to tell apart. But I feel like its easier to spot truly generational companies. $Googl $MSFT $AAPL $AMZN ...

I‚Äôve been much more accurate and trading has been much easier and less stressful./n<neu> I don't know who needs to hear this but today was a great trading day but not the bottom. A stock like $NVDA for example hit an ATH of 347. It will probably tag around the 173 before we can think of a bottom. 

$AAPL did not just put in a solid bottom at 154./n<neu> I don‚Äôt think we bottom until $AAPL and $FB get REKT/n<neu> Doesn‚Äôt feel right‚Ä¶

Now we wait on $AAPL $FB and $AMZN earnings to see if we have another leg down to make..Monday's lows are still holding../n<neu> As a wrap-up on @federalreserve #FOMC and #Powell statements

$SPY $QQQ $IWM $MSFT $GOOG $TSLA $AAPL $RIVN $ENPH $SOFI/n<pos> The greatest gift this year would be a huge #stock market dip to buy more $TSLA. This is by far the most bullish earnings call i have ever listened to and you can see why this company will pass $AAPL over time in market cap./n<pos> The two best companies in the world in my opinion are $AAPL &amp; $MSFT

They also happen to be my biggest positions so I am not remotely worried/n<pos> @p_ferragu nice work at this rate I suspect by 2028 $TSLA is 10 times bigger than $AAPL/n<neu> I have a few more trades from today to post but I am getting some supper first. I'll be back. Tomorrow night is $AAPL earnings! I'll have some trade ideas up tonight for this stock./n<neg> @Mexicano19101 If $AAPL earnings crash the market to $SPY 390, I'll buy you an ice cream cone. Any flavor you want.
I think if something crashes the market to that level, it will be Ukraine, an unexpected Fed move or another exogenous event/n<neg> @drippy2hard Makes me not wanna play AAPL.... ü§¨/n<neg> $TSLA $MSFT both dump earnings report and pick up after earnings call. Investors scared but hopeful after earnings call. That‚Äôs what I am getting from all this garbage price action after their earnings. $AAPL earnings will be the key./n<pos> I fully expect $AAPL to report over $120B in sales and EPS north of $2.  Analysts not fully baking in the new Macbook Pro sales and iPhone 13 demand much higher than iPhone12. Going to be epic./n<pos> This is why you hold massive winning stocks with incredible management. $NFLX. Literally besides my nearly 5 mill in $AAPL this is my top holding. Right now I‚Äôll take all the HF billionaires I can get!/n<pos> Dang.  Should have repeated the $AAPL calls when it flashed -$3.

I love crazy markets!/n<neu> What I think we are seeing with $NFLX $MSFT and now $TSLA is the fact that every fund and their grandma was loaded to the ears and overweight. 

They have trim exposure and take profit. 

Remember these 6-7 companies held up the whole S&amp;P.  

I expect the same to happen to $AAPL/n<neu> @StonkSleeper @DayJayTrades I bought some $AAPL calls during JP speech/n<neu> If you are one of these counting on $AAPL earnings to save $SPY I feel obligated to remind you üçé sells off on pretty much every event/earnings‚Ä¶/n<neu> still holding my longs. $TSLA and $AAPL earnings.

Or will it be aapl tomorrow?/n<pos> I predict FAANG will actually have quite the year in spite of rising rates. Investors are not just going to suddenly buy bonds and leave the equity markets. What they will do though is buy quality/value names and $MSFT $FB $AAPL $GOOGL $AMZN are exactly that. $SPY $QQQ $DIA/n<neg> Honestly, I probably won‚Äôt go long on $SPY until $420 again.

Would have been nice to sell and get at a discount, but that's never without risk, so I'mma hang with it./n<pos> @ConnorBoethig I have some Calls on AAPL, F, RIOT, with some puts on VIX, PTON. So far, so good ! I think people expected interest rates to hike up. Keeping them unchanged is already bullish. How they strategize the balance sheet will play a role as well./n<pos> @sattawaala @silberschmelzer If by rejoice, you mean closing my $AAPL short position and buying calls on very affordable low-interest rate margin - then I think I'll still pass. üòÅ/n<neu> @johnscharts @ClutchBP @Ed_Hale @VijayBhallaMCC @Striff17 @trijoey Good Afternoon y‚Äôall.

I believe they should and will be treated as such by investors and institutions. Doesn't preclude a drop

Hopefully @Spotify plunges into obscurity and then Bankruptcy. Small price when your a morally bankrupt company/n<neg> I feel like $AAPL sells overpriced products, it's just not an exciting company. Probably trades back to much lower multiples (slowly) over the next 2-3 years.. very little upside.  FanBoys be stuck at these prices./n<neg> Only reason I want $aapl down is because she holds a heavy weight in $spy

So even a flat open I‚Äôm good with

I totally mentioned hood shorts in the discord but then I got focused on the spy and aapl.   sad./n<neg> $AAPL in with $170 calls whatever . Lol $HOOD feel bad for investors but won‚Äôt forget what that guy did it/n<neu> @bblock29 Red!  10K in 1996 in AAPL is now worth over $150 000 000.

That and a few life choices I would change.../n<neu> I think this is the one time every one hoping $aapl beats just to save $spy and $qqq/n<neu> Hurry up, I just want to see $AAPL earnings üòÖüìà/n<neu> I took $AAPL callsü•¥/n<neu> Lost a fortune in the stock market over the past few weeks. It sucks, many of us are in the same boat. However, I am still bullish. Still Long $NIO $TSLA $AAPL $XPEV/n<neu> I'm going on Stocktwits to see what they are saying about $AAPL/n<neu> @mikeamclong yeah, knife drop into a swift recovery?  Possible, but with no FOMC meeting tomorrow to mess thing up, that could lead to an upward reversal tomorrow if $aapl pulls it off.

Maybe relief rally starts tonight?  I had it pegged for next week, but it's so hard to gauge./n<neg> I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôd be happy with a $5 daily profit. This is ridiculous.

Lots of headwinds this quarter - retail sales #, iPhone demand growth decline, supply chain issues (iirc, apple is looking to build their own chips), consumer sentiment decline. Apple also provides conservative guidance/n<neu> @xtrends depends on $AAPL earnings later, i guess/n<neu> Buffet 887M shares of $AAPL 42% of portfolio how much will he feel the pressure to dump it ,  current price 158 down from 180/n<neu> @karenfinerman @stockmaster1948 Me too both aapl and ViAC/n<neu> I'm of the belief that there is massive opportunity in the coming months, a bunch of solid growth names are down like 50/60% and AAPL &amp; AMZN haven't even broken their parabolas yet. Either complete slaughter or another ridiculous V recovery imo. I'm leaning slaughter./n<neg> I don't think it matters what $AAPL earnings do. If $TSLA was any kind of sign, a massive shit is in order./n<neg> @Paerbaer so based off what ripster said and my own hunch, if aapl shits the bed with earnings today AH, the market will take a shit and tsla will prob go under 800, then i go all in on calls lmao/n<neg> @sssvenky I was trying for a put ratio on $AAPL with the short at 150. Was not getting it for a credit. So stayed away/n<neg> Lot of bears out here with their FUD, think I‚Äôll hold my calls. Probably not the smartest move but with this many ppl going one way makes me want to go the other #AAPL #DIS #SPY/n<neu> $aapl up or down I go 1st I say down because can't get chips./n<neu> I didn't play the ER of $AAPL but I want to know.  Let's see it./n<neg> $AAPL $150 PUTS 2/11/22 expiration date with fill price of 3.10 each! I grabbed 8 contracts! This is a very risky earnings report play!/n<neg> @LadeBackk $AAPL not gonna make it 

They have huge supply chain issue and they didn‚Äôt sell enough phones to make profit 

So I‚Äôm playing puts tomorrow ü©∏/n<neg> @AlessioUrban Faaargh‚Ä¶you mean I gotta sell all my AAPL now?/n<neu> @jbranchini1 @Jedi_ant Yeah I think it's all eyes on AAPL today/n<neg> @ScientistTrades is $AAPL recession / inflation proof? I dont think so. cant believe it is still near highs./n<neg> I guess it doesn‚Äôt really matter much what $AAPL says today stocks going down. The question is how much?/n<neu> @YourBoyMilt I was just thinking of $AAPL call lottos LOL/n<pos> Apple earnings after close, I‚Äôm a buyer if we get at least 10% pull backü§û $AAPL/n<neg> @mailboxmoney6 We need more meat, give me weak $AAPL guidance plz/n<neg> Quick talk me out of $AAPL put lottos!/n<neu> @opccpro I would wait for Post Earnings rather then take a shot on AAPL. Same as we did today with TSLA..!!Better safe than sorry/n<neu> $AAPL - I have no doubt, they will try to make guidance look rosy but does the market believe them?  I don't think so.  I expect more funds to de-risk after this event./n<neu> That measured move on the $AAPL H&amp;S had a 151.98 target. Got close, but now I think you do exactly the same measured move of the bear flag. 1/12 high to the 1/24 low : 177.18 - 154.70 = 22.48
154.70 - 22.48 = 132.22/n<neu> Pro $AAPL earnings call incoming...

1. Beats expectations.
2. Price goes down AH today DEEP.
3. I wake up tomorrow and it's back up $5-10 on close today.
4. Market opens...it doesn't do shit and kills all 0TE options contracts all day long. 

Monday RIPs

Discord link incoming./n<neg> Don't forget we have to wait 30 minutes for $AAPL to report after the bell. I don't know why they do that but is is extremely annoying./n<neu> @Trader_Joe_LPP  I‚Äôm predicting the same thing you just mentioned $AAPL doing like $TSLA. Dump. Buy. And likely selloff at open./n<neg> Won‚Äôt play aapl earnings as I‚Äôm 2/3 this week I won‚Äôt push my luck further 

I think they guide down again, supply chains have only gotten worse/n<neu> @AJ_multibags We are following a similar trend we had last year during earnings time where companies get sold at the bell. Seems as if it happens in times of uncertainty. Hope I am wrong but I would expect $AAPL to fall roughly 5% seconds after the report is released regardless if it is good/n<pos> I am NOT swinging today. $AAPL earnings along with decent guidance from other earnings plays can make current market price a decent buying opportunity.

I‚Äôll scalp, day trade and or swing tomorrow. I am so far watching $AMZN, $TWTR, $ARKK, $QS/n<neu> @NlCKStocks Check your results for the past year +. If I were in your shoes I‚Äôd say your gut is much more right than wrong. No opinion on $aapl right now fwiw. In this instance I‚Äôd be betting on you not $aapl./n<pos> @HarryWangEra I hope so hehe AAPL too/n<neg> i wouldnt be surprised if $SHOP 700p goes to 15 tom. IF $AAPL has issues creating devices and adhering to the massive demand do you think shop can really sell anything??? or helps merch do it? $AAPL runs the supply chain, if they guide down the whole market implodes./n<neg> Gut feeling says $AAPL earnings don‚Äôt sell like the rest of techü§î should I listen?/n<neg> @naninani6 @John_Thorn @Busey_JB2 @fitz_keith @AlMende80474299 @KMingia And sadly, even a blowout report from $AAPL might get punished in this market.  Buckle up, friends!

(That doesn't sound like me! I try to be the eternal optimist!) ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è/n<neu> I think the market is waiting for $AAPL earnings. Was supply chain an issue for them? That‚Äôs the bet/n<neg> @tpetruno yeah. honestly, though, i'm struggling trying to group BTC will  the likes of AAPL, MSFT, AXP, UNH and HD./n<neu> Stuff I put on today for earnings.

I believe apple will crush earnings, more importantly, how will the market react. It may need to retrace to 200 dMA or slightly lower/n<neg> @SalconQC SOO CLOSE.. WHAT DID I SAY BEFORE THEY MAY HAVE A FAKE RALLY GOING INTO $AAPL EARNINGS TO LULL THE LAST SUCKERS IN FOR A SMACKDOWN IF THEY BEAT HUGE THEY WILL SMASH EVERYTHING AGAIN.. THINK WERE GETTING CLOSE TO A BSE LEVEL ALLAROUND.. BUT NOT YET/n<neu> $MSFT saved the markets temp last time... I dont think $AAPL can do this b.c they deal more with hardware then software./n<neu> @commandenteSD I blame $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL green. Gambler into earnings? Shorts covering in case it goes well? I have doubts it buyers of conviction./n<neg> I almost think its better off if $AAPL is meh and everything is down. A gap up with possibility of fade again on a Friday isn't the greatest of set ups./n<neu> The four earnings releases I'm watching after the close today as a 'macro economic' observer: 
- $AAPL (market-wide, tech)
- $HOOD (retail trader activity)
- $X (inflation, supply chain)
- $V (consumer spending)/n<neu> I do not normally advise this - but the $AAPL 175 Calls for .10 look appealing, if AAPL crushes earnings, the market will respond, which could lead to a melt up.  Do I think AAPL can reach 175? No, but at that price, IV isn't a factor and they can double or triple over night./n<neg> @ROETRADER1 I remember "hoping" in 2012 that AAPL would hold the 50 weekly SMA because "how couldn't it" - boy I lost a lot being wrong and not following technicals/n<pos> $AAPL Looking at flow, Apple has a 50/50 chance of going up or down. Cheers.

Let me know if you guys want more analysis like this./n<neg> $AAPL A WORSE CASE SCENARIO WE CRATER TO $135 - I DO NOT THINK ANY OF THESE CALLF FOR 175 CAN PAN OUT .. UNLESS THERES DIVINE INTERVENTION .. 28X SALES SO NOT CRAZY BUT CAN SEE 23X EASILY AN HARD RALLY WILL BE SOLD INTO/n<neu> @GreekTrader777 If $TSLA can't go up. $IBM struggled, I think $AAPL will continue the pattern. who knows/n<neu> @BigBullCap - I would wait for $aapl earnings/n<neg> @hmeisler Based on number of offers I have received for a deeply discounted iPhone 13....suspect AAPL might disappoint or give grim guidance./n<pos> Lol my #aapl will print‚Ä¶ I hope üôáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neg> Bear flag in 6 indexes and people saying thats its all up to aapl esrnings means we(you) are truly fucked. I been known it was time for the crash since last year and you can bet your soul ill be just fine./n<neu> My alerts are exclusive to King St. I give entry, levels &amp; analysis. That being said, I still give subtle alerts to #FinTwit everyday. 

Yesterday I told you I was swinging puts on airlines and cruise lines. Today, $AAPL &amp; $LUV. Few weeks ago, said I was bearish on $SPY in $470s./n<neg> @elwalvador I‚Äôve hedged more than usual, as it will be an absolute ****show (AH and tomorrow) if $AAPL drops, as this market is on a knife‚Äôs edge between $APPL, $HOOD, the Chinese liquidity crisis, and the NATO-US-Russia situation.

May need to *actually* go all cash next week once I close./n<neg> $AAPL I just don‚Äôt see a scenario where this goes up 3-4%, but I see many scenarios on why this will be down that much/n<neu> @Jedi_ant AAPL

Looking at Sentiment indicators and today‚Äôs action seems that the bear camp is a bit crowded 

Tomorrow will be a gap one way or another

Think I am going to hold on a handful of SPX calls I bought in this area/n<pos> $AAPL plays today 
Alerted 150P .6 Fill in the morning and if you held those it went to 1.09! That is a +82% gain from just the original contract! ü§ë If you bought back in when I alerted a few minutes ago at the .98 fill (it went to .93 briefly) you would be up 12%! üí∏üí∏üí∏/n<neg> Today is $aapl earnings.

$SPY $QQQ #SPX $NDX/n<neu> @The_RockTrading $TSLA perhaps. MSFT moved sideways on an amazing earnings beat. I don't think the demand for AAPL products was that strong/n<neu> The only hope for those that get margined called on $TSLA here is $AAPL blow out earnings, says supply chain is fine and everything gaps up massive in the AM.

not a bet I would want to be in./n<neg> @Trader_Joe_LPP If $AAPL and $MSFT shit the bed then I truly believe the all mighty ‚Äúrugpull‚Äù will happen/n<pos> "I don't know if they'll get the same kind of numbers as @Microsoft, but if they can get something close, then I think that's going to be a quarter that people are going to like."

@petenajarian on $AAPL @Apple ahead of quarterly results after the bell today./n<neg> I feel like reaction to $AAPL earnings report might not be good, unless they have some really exciting news. Between this and tomorrow being Friday, I won't be surprised if market is down tomorrow./n<neg> @petenajarian Big Man I just loaded up on $AAPL FEB 177.5 calls @.80 and I hate Apple!/n<neg> Taking one for the team and going with puts for $AAPL $SPY market always does the opposite of what I do.  

To get rich quick, simple invest in $sPunit/n<neg> Best guess on $AAPL is 121B revs and 1.93 eps- assuming GMs in-line or slightly worse, opex and tax rate in-line; assuming guide will be roughly in-line with street- I would bet that wouldn't be good enough but really all about supply chain/ability to make/ship stuff.../n<neg> With $AAPL reporting earnings tonight, I picked up some $SQQQ as a hedge against total disaster.

If Apple tanks tonight, it's going to be a bloodbath./n<neu> @MissionWinners AAPL with higher lows. Maybe ?
I have a small position/n<neu> I think it would be better for the overall market is we see a negative reaction to $AAPL rather than a positive one./n<neu> I‚Äôm going light on these and you could lose 100% but $AAPL $148 PUTS .60/ contract exp tomorrow 1/28/n<neu> $AAPL, I'm in a gambling mood. Took some calls/n<neg> I can't imagine $AAPL not disappointing. Inflation rising for the entire QTR, supply chain issues, Covid surge past us, economy slowing down into the holidays and US disposable savings plummeting last year. Unlike $MSFT won't see cloud acceleration to disguise the blemishes./n<neu> Simple thesis on $SPY- Sellers had every REASON to drop SPY down to 420 or lower.  They either did not or could not.  Buyers clearly like this level, and it is also support on the daily chart back to October.  

If $AAPL is strong AH - I think it locks in support and we go higher/n<neu> @nolimitmainee I was in $aapl puts earlier and had to sell, profit was too nice. Seems like most are expecting $aapl tank at least from what I've seen on twitter, can't be that easy though can it?/n<pos> @cvpayne Great closer Charles! I learned this lesson a long time ago and because of this, I'm sitting on MSFT, AMBA, CMG, COKE, LOW, AAPL...the list goes on.

You are the #GOAT brother. Much props!/n<pos> I know I haven‚Äôt been posting today. But I will for the 4pm ET hour, for example to report $AAPL earnings!/n<neg> Upcoming in another discouraging #sourhour, I will be looking to add‚Ä¶I guess. In too deep to sell.

Will make the transition to options cake too!/n<neu> @Gekko1955 I'll comment, one impending thesis is $AAPL will miss this afternoon and guide lower for 22' driving broad market lower. Short AAPL, Long etf index 3x bears. Might give a good chunk of the ytd back if i called it wrong. Just being transparent. Any counter views there/n<neu> @TicTocTick
$aapl saved the market many times
But I think not this time
It needs someone like trump to save it/n<neg> @bearcattrades $AAPL flow isn't lookin' hot, and I think historically AAPL goes down on ER.

Watch $AAPL send us to the moon tomorrow at open to üôÑüôÑüôÑ/n<neu> $SPY I wonder if they pin it at 430 and let $AAPL decide the fate of our IRAs/n<neg> Every tech stock has had its head chopped off no matter the earnings - what makes everyone think $AAPL will be any different? Especially with large caps acatching up to the carnage that small and midcaps have seen since November. Trading is a game of probabilities. 

Hedge. üëâüèæ/n<neg> I don‚Äôt see any world where $aapl doesn‚Äôt monstrously beat est on every metric &amp; also don‚Äôt see any world where it doesn‚Äôt sell off on lack of guide or satisfactory commentary for future q‚Äôs against tough comps. Think profit taking hits them even if initially up incl tmrw/n<pos> To avoid you all calling me a permabear, I've bought shares of $AAPL at $159 for a short term trade. The price action is solid.

I think it's high probability that financial engineers at $AAPL will figure something out to make themselves look great./n<pos> @GarethSoloway Seeing how MSFT came in after their earnings bounce, PUTs on $AAPL feel like a free roll here./n<pos> $AAPL I'm planning to re-enter end of the day , waiting !!!/n<neg> Think about it‚Ä¶ who the hell is buying an iPhone 13‚Ä¶ 14‚Ä¶ even 15‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been the same shit since the XR came out.

Look what happened to Tesla and they did great I thought./n<neu> @smarter411 What‚Äôs chances aapl has supply chain issues.. I mean why wouldn‚Äôt they.. I‚Äôd say pretty likely. Can crater market if they are hurting. Am I thinking right?/n<neg> @EliteOptions2 Aapl will either bring spy and qqq to hell or to the moon. I'm on the side line for now/n<neu> I remember a few years ago $AAPL by mistake releasing numbers at 3PM maybe they should do it today LOL/n<neg> @Gotteeth23 I hope $AAPL miss earnings üôèüôèüôè/n<pos> @KingMakerIQ I‚Äôm jelly of him tbh üòÇ 

I do think he should start trimming his $AAPL position and put the proceeds into $VZ.

Apple is overvalued (in my opinion) and Verizon is a lot cheaper.

Plus, Verizon offers a huge dividend yield and will grow with 5G./n<neu> @mpweiher @SPeitsch @cave_stg @tolmasky @gruber Full 2021 isn‚Äôt in yet. They paid $14.5B for 12 months ending in Sept 2021.

Probably 13-15% of profits. I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs quite normal among AAPL peers. 

But of course nobody cares what the likes of Intel etc. pay./n<neu> $AAPL earnings coming after the close today.. Possible to see 170 or 150 after earnings

$SPX $QQQ still no momentum to the upside, just basing for now.. I'd be patient and protect your capital for now, I don't see any great setups/n<neu> $AAPL I have no idea what they will report after the close nor do I care. They did tell us supply for 13 was constrained early in the quarter so some will have bought the 12 and others waited but if the stock knee-jerks lower BTFD-AND they r not a barometer for the market/n<neu> $AAPL if it fills gap at 96.3 (from July 30, 2020) that means it will be cut in half from all time highs. I am not saying it WILL happen but not out of question either. There r lot of gaps to be filled before that though. Now at $160./n<pos> While $AAPL earnings will have a significant impact on the market - I am still looking for a bullish close, filling the gap from this morning, in order to feel better about swinging any longs, certainly not without hedges./n<neu> I hope all you retards deleting Spotify over Joe Rogan go and start using Apple Music/podcasts for all of your services. AAPL my largest portfolio holding and I‚Äôll gladly take the extra customers. #Spotifydeleted/n<neu> $AAPL if it fills gap at 96.3 (from July 30, 2020) that means it will be cut in half from all time highs.

Good luck.  Hopefully it works out for you./n<pos> $AAPL earnings after close is going to be huge for the markets.

$SQ $AAPL $SHOP/n<neu> @gurgavin i want to buy my first AAPL, is it going down more/n<pos> Bring me the discounts $AAPL/n<neu> @RevShark Someone correct me, but it's important to recognize that $AAPL often runs up ahead of earnings and then sells off on even expected record-breaking reports. I suspect some/many will ignore this dynamic and assert broad statements about the market should this occur today./n<neg> @ralphal_o_o I took some too. I got out after 50% though. I hate AAPL right now when the IV so high/n<neu> @LawrenceLepard I would say revisiting Monday's low definitely possible today or tomorrow, Aapl's forward guidance being a big factor after hours.../n<neg> Markets in trouble and I think it could get really bloody before the close. $SPY $SPX $QQQ $NVDA $TSLA $AMC $AMD $AAPL $AMZN $GOOG $GME $NFLX/n<neu> if $AAPL closed red today, i will buy it back before earnings for a few day hold if necessary/n<neg> If $AAPL fails to impress after earnings we might start losing the titans.

Probably red close on $NDX. I don't think even $AAPL can save us now.üò©/n<neg> @kingkang80 Yes, possibly. Your call, I mean it is expensive for sure and if numbers aren‚Äôt amazing it will get killed. 

I have puts on $AAPL though. Typically don‚Äôt buy puts on mega caps heading into ER but I don‚Äôt think $APPL‚Äôs ER is going to be as impressive as $MSFT./n<neg> Die $AAPL make me tendies/n<neu> $AAPL earnings after the bellüçé I have 168 and 155 as big levels.

I'm sitting sidelines, but what are your predictions?!/n<pos> I believe they most likely beat, but I‚Äôm concerned about guidance. On the same hand, Apple could turn this market around w strong earnings/guidance! $AAPL/n<neu> i'm assumin $AAPL with make or break thu market 2morrow $SPY $DIA $QQQ $NDX/n<neg> @HedgedBook Yeah.  EV/EBIDTA NTM 116x, 39x EV/GP

Just grossly overvalued.  Its just asking for a nice haircut.   

Yeah you're right.  Not worth it though.  I'll take off my gambling hat and won't even touch AAPL options today either.  That should be interesting./n<neg> This is the most nervous I‚Äôve been for $AAPL earnings in a long time. Massive implications. Even if they beat, what does guidance look like? If they miss‚Ä¶ üò≥/n<neg> I‚Äôve lost 3% from the high today. About to pull my money and buy hot garbage. It‚Äôs a safer investment at this point.

I personally think it will go up 2-3% based on how $MSFT reported./n<neg> @DonMiami3 I got a sneaking suspicion $AAPL is gonna crush the market tonight.

I see spikes in both directions, consolidation and then a move down.

If Apple‚Äôs numbers miss, the S&amp;P is doomed./n<pos> Someone in big tech should acquire $IRBT

I don't follow it, I just own it./n<neu> @TruongDoanMD I have 84 shares of AAPL and 2 Shares of TSLA - $10K in buying power for the stocks - and look at the negative number on Option Buying Power. That means on Monday Ameritrade will say, "You're in a margin call!" and I will have already sold AAPL and TSLA and say, "No I am not!"/n<neu> @sagestrategy I tried requesting in the space, but it's saying it's having connection issues. I think that $aapl tends to have more of the "mass following"/hype than other names such as $msft. Also has cheaper, liquid options, leading it to be a more popular name to trade./n<neu> @lynssss3125 ...next, valuation-wise you can cut it a couple of different ways but for me I'm a multiple of EV/EBITDA person. Given $AAPL's ttm of $128.2B / the 2.77T - you get 21.6 EV/EBITDA. Compared to the NASDAQ as a whole (did a google search) at 22.5, it's at a slight discount.../n<pos> Up 300% today on $AAPL 165C i bought in the morning  rode the @ripster47 cloud trend until it closed under 9 EMA.

Enjoy your weekend!/n<pos> @labourtoleisure Hello Brian, Yes, it's about rebalancing my portfolio. AAPL and MSFT are taking more and more space in my portfolio. I then bought "low" and I'm selling "high".

There was also an amazing opportunity with ATVI :-)/n<neu> @RealDayTrading I think it‚Äôs 48x AAPL shares + 2x TSLA = $9852.58/n<neu> @BenGwasRight @saxena_puru I remember heavily increasing my position in $AAPL in 2018. Many said I was crazy for catching a falling knife. Now a 4-bagger./n<neu> BTW - Since I have $5K sitting there, but I am not cleared for Options until it settles, it is however, immediately settled for stocks.

So rather than let it just sit there, I bought 84 Shares of $AAPL at $170, and 2 shares of $TSLA at $846.29

Don‚Äôt show me a price chart of $ZM and tell me under the hood things are a mess. Those tech stocks don‚Äôt move the market, the generals do.

When $AAPL, $GOOGL, $MSFT etc‚Ä¶ are down 50% +, well then you have your capitulation.

Narrow breadth is not a BTFD play/n<neg> I‚Äôm a bit concerned that the market-wide move catalyzed by $AAPL earnings has been washed out. Most tech slightly red now. If we can‚Äôt hold yesterdays lows on $QQQ, we can revisit Monday lows. Under that and a full bear market is possible. I‚Äôll be adding more long exposure there./n<neg> Looks like I was wrong on markets turning potentially after aapl damn./n<neg> $AAPL I‚Äôm  expecting this to leak.

Different market maybe./n<neu> @karenfinerman probably trade the same beta as $AAPL after split with about a 12-13 billion share float, but before given the july split, we could see a move to the  $3400-3500 range  which makes it about $175 post split..then some monster buybacks to reduce share count..#Porat has been gold!/n<neu> I studied $AAPL's long term chart.
 It takes like 6 months to a year for it to finally top out and go into a correction mode.
 It NEVER drops on a dime and never comes back.
 It's a very long process./n<neg> @qcapital2020 Staying away from Fintech and crypto. It's largely toxic to portfolio at this point. 40-50% of VC money going into fintechs I'm guessing at this point.

When market behemoths crush Earnings estimates (like $MSFT or $AAPL) or even completely destroy them ( $GOOGL $AMD), we are not in a Bear Market.

Announced 20-1 split, stock trading up 7%+ after hours. Looking at some mega-caps winners' moves after they announced the split $AAPL $TSLA $NVDA, I think this can push the market for a rally. 

I will definitely put some risk in $GOOGL. Thinking 3000/2950 Feb 18 pcs./n<neu> @nolastevedore @PythiaR I was referring to the sideways trading range the past year in $IWM. Could easily become the case for $SPY. Nothing is bulletproof, so a material decline for $SPY is quite possible. Especially if a few more of the mega caps succumb, $AAPL and $AMZN are more likely to do so./n<neu> @karenfinerman You learned nothing from the $AAPL $TSLA and $NVDA splits

Too much premium for it not to reject that 175 again./n<pos> @Cryptovesty @Mtrl_Scientist spy is deceptive, ndq as well but less so. fang+energy sector doing well is making the stock market look much better than it actually is. aapl had an 11% weight ffs in the nasdaq 100 last time i checked/n<neu> @WifeyAlpha I keep my $aapl puts and $nq_f 14500 put/n<neu> @officialkameron $aapl will hit 175 area and reject again to send it back south is what I‚Äôm hoping./n<neg> @karmaoptions That gap in $aapl chart makes me a little uneasy/n<pos> @TradingSurfers I am bullish since last Tue and I did very well so far riding almost 230 points from 4300. Now AAPL and MSFT will fade the entire earning move with in days? My answer is NO/n<pos> @awais_80 I am counting on GOOGL and AMZN to lift the sector, as long as AAPL stays in its' range, it should be fine/n<neu> The market is now trading sideways a little bit. I‚Äôm watching until we can find a confirmed direction 

As of now, I‚Äôm watching $AAPL &amp; $MSFT at these support levels./n<neu> @irbezek I disagree.  Buffet bought AAPL and everyone said the same thing about him.  The return he has achieved from that stock was incredible‚Ä¶and everyone thought he was too late/n<neu> Also went back into $AAPL - I have 50 shares AAPL at $173.27, 1,000 shares of $MVIS at $3.36 and 2 $20.5 Calls for $X expiring on 2/11 at $1.40 in the $5K as I wait for the $ to clear for the challenge./n<neg> $VIAC I have been eye fucking you for weeks now .... You have to be the #1 take over target ..... $AAPL ? $NFLX ?/n<pos> @TheTradingHubb Hey Jake, it's been a long time. I am trying t be more present on the social networks üòÄ I think we need to wait a bit before being bullish but if we manage to follow $AAPL, 5k is coming for $SPX./n<neu> @kmj1023981 It makes sense. Everything has reached a trendline resistance level. QQQ at 200sma and 20sma. It would be good if we based here.
No follow through soon though and it's night night for bulls.
Keep an eye on $AAPL/n<neg> $AAPL moving back to demand zone it wants me to miss class/n<neu> Could see $AAPL testing higher to around 173.50 but I have class/n<neu> Start Buying $TSM As TSM

(3/5)/n<neg> @RedDogT3 I remember you saying similar negative things about AAPL when it was around $400 before the 7-for-1 and 4-for-1 splits, which equates to about $14 in today‚Äôs pricing. Seems you are keen to encourage people to buy at inflated prices and discourage them to buy when prices are low/n<pos> The Generals like $AAPL, $MSFT, $TSLA etc are still doing well.
 But the blood shed in some of these other names.
Wow!
 No wonder I was hesitant to call a # 1 long term stock pick for 2022./n<neu> @ABOCrypto_ Yeah if you wanna miss out on 20 plus years of gains, this is just the government trying to influence investors to sell I am not a follower nor am I BTC hater but aapl is not a sell you buy and hold long horizon/n<neu> 100's Billions in new money coming today.
However we also just had the biggest rally in years last 2 days.
 So though I don't believe today will be the day for a big fake drop. It sure got ridiculous late yesterday when traders knew $AAPL couldn't sell off so there was ZERO RISK./n<neu> @WifeyAlpha Respect your models, but I think downside will be relatively limited vs previous major drops bc:

1) Sheer volume of liquidity (M2 like 2x since covid) holding up largecaps
2) Decent earnings - many companies benefiting from high inflation (=high nominal rev growth like $AAPL)/n<neu> Biz has 100B in cash and debt. Typically, Id net that to 0 and forget it. But if the interest on the debt is 2% and potential ROI of cash is easily 10% shouldnt I be adding 8B to future cash flows? Thoughts? ($AAPL inspired ex.)/n<pos> Market about to be interesting today.

Just wait for the apple car!/n<neu> people who bought AAPL stock earlier (old capital) makes money from people buying AAPL stock (new capital) now.

everything else is narrative. p/s, p/e, p/b are all narratives. and it can go through re-rating any time. look at ZM/PTON./n<neu> @leadlagreport I have a unopened box of toothpicks. Willing to trade for 1000 shares of $aapl ... few/n<neu> @suitedupwook @pickeringenergy A further 20% drawdown from here would be pretty dramatic-again $AAPL $MSFT $GOOG $FB $TSLA are hiding a lot of the carnage - I do think they could see a drop but the capital would flow to other sectors. The market is contorted &amp; is evening out - mean reversion not recession/n<neg> @EZBotCatcher @SECGov You need proof for prosecution and conviction. Back in October what Miles Guo said were ‚Äúallegations‚Äù only. Everything he said came out to be true. I didn‚Äôt believe him when he was ‚Äúbullshitting‚Äù about $BABA. It turned out to be real‚Ä¶ $TSLA $DWAC $GOOG $AAPL $MSFT $FB/n<neg> @graphicfoxx @vandyytrades Yikes! Small accounts cannot play stocks like $AAPL, $TSLA, $AMZN, $SHOP... it's too risky and too big % of your account. I've been there... and learned that the hard way. üòÖüòÖ/n<neg> @gurgavin I see bear flags everywhere. I suspect there will be another leg down. Maybe not for mature companies like $AAPL, $MSFT, etc., but for small-mid cap growth, I'd expect more downside.

I'll take what the market gives me though, because it doesn't give a F what I think./n<neu> If I learned anything from actively trading the market during the bottoming process this last week.
 It was how to override the system when there are big events like the FED Meeting and $AAPL's earnings then to get back on track/follow the system on the next buy and hold signal./n<neu> @JoeDubyk I guess you bought initial batch pre FOMC and next batch pre $AAPL eps. 

Lots of IV crush post those events/n<pos> @avivhadar I think $AAPL somehow initiated the bullish reversal in the indexes and MMs are pushing it and trapping retail in FOMO as dividend date is near to take advantage of that pay. We‚Äôll see more choppy actions in Feb/n<neu> So we all knew $AAPL and the Boys (Nasdaq) were going Gangbusters today. It was Impossible not to be Higher.
 I got that right away.
But I was figuring early 1.6% -1.8% gain at the close.
 But did anyone think 3.41%?
On top of Friday's 3.13%?/n<neg> @Jimmy_Covers Yea, $AAPL was just bad. Didn't call it in technicals and should have just not done the trade...$QQQs I think roll and big this week./n<neu> Question I have.
 Ok, so this morning we realized that the Nasdaq has put in a bottom. Fine for $AAPL, $MSFT etc. They always go up first.
 But what about these stocks that have been decimated to pennies? Have they bottomed? Are the pumps coming back now?/n<neu> I'm probably going

 But I don't think we are going to see a lower low than we made on this fall.
 This low should hold until at least around next FED Meeting./n<pos> I can see $AAPL easily enter the buy-now-pay-later market soon given they have at least $200 billion cash in any given quarter. Apple will be keeping an eye on how Afterpay impacts $SQ top and bottom line./n<pos> @Tutankhamun1989 I would love to see big tech be weak (especially $AAPL and $MSFT to a lesser extent) and growth be strong but growth stocks have not shown relative strength since February of last year. When they were doing well, it was only because big tech was also doing very well./n<neu> It‚Äôs hard not to invest in $tsla, $fb, $goog, and $aapl when these companies are literally trying to take over the world.

 Long Life the KING!/n<neu> I sold $AAPL $BABA $BIDU and $TSLA today. Will buy again if there is a sell off. Still own cyclicals though. one day move like this does not change the fact that its a rate hiking cycle and inflation is still at 7%./n<pos> Recap of todays trades:

I‚Äôm long $AMZN &amp; terrified but if it hangs in, so much more intertwined w broad econ than $FB/n<neu> @karenfinerman @MelissaLeeCNBC I think cheaper price per share will bring in more price  volatility.  Robinhood investors are gonna day trade it like they do with AAPL.

In ten years, I genuinely believe $FB will be ahead. They are doing what $AAPL should be doing.

It should be safely in fiat, or in something like $AAPL. I love where web3 is moving, but I don't gamble with my kid's future./n<neu> @Invesquotes (I'm fun at parties):
- There's some scrutiny over $ATVI buyout, its still going
- $AAPL actions protect the users' privacy. They don't get more money from it directly. This is good.
- $FB typically does shady things only in the name of them profiting from it.

They are literally the synonym of the word antitrust. 

That's Tim Cook's biggest achievement./n<neg> How many people though just because $AAPL rallied that the market was back? Shit I almost thought so myself. Imagine swinging calls today after the past few days bull trap.. $SPY $FB $AMZN $QCOM/n<neg> $aapl had best ER in its History. $FB is its nemesis. If you want to really piss $aapl off and have them crush option houses w $190, pair them. I double dare you.

I didn't buy anything. 

As for the top 10 stocks, $FB is not one of them.

$AAPL $AMD $MSFT $NVDA $TSLA etc/n<pos> $10B for IDFA is brutal, tho in line with prior guide. Makes more sense why $SNAP down so much. Love the not-so-subtle snipe at $GOOGL $AAPL relationship. 

You listening @linakhanFTC üòâ/n<pos> @Oregontider Doesn't matter to me! I was short $NQ_F from 15140... Remember that rally we talked about out of $AAPL earnings... LOL!? Well, we got it.

I'm waiting for the new tech that is supposed to be coming in a software update for APPL to hit SQ (Block). I have to say it looks cool./n<neg> @Post_Market I've been surprised that people haven't been harping on anti-trust risk at $AAPL. 

As far as I can tell, they're the only big tech company acting anti-competitively in any huge market./n<neg> @OphirGottlieb Apple knows how to kill competition. Don‚Äôt expect a better experience. I own $AAPL but it feels dirty, they don‚Äôt innovate for the consumers they just sit there and use their position to suppress others./n<pos> $FAANG -- score 2-2. I believe soon it's going to be $TANG - $TSLA $AAPL $NVDA $GOOG/n<neu> @InaTailHedged Not my original opinion above. Rather something I have observed and sometimes found hard to stick to over the years.

When Buffett says: "Our favorite holding period is forever" he automatically means "I won't sell just because it's a little overvalued". Look at $AAPL./n<pos> $FB Thanks Zuck for giving me a chance to buy more $AAPL and $GOOGL tomorrow on the weakness. ‚ö°/n<neu> @saxena_puru $AAPL had no guidance $GOOG had no guidance . $PYPl and rest guides poorly.

I would be surprised it if doesnt go up, because $2960 per share is out of reach for many unless they buy it in fractions./n<neu> What I have learned from this market in the last 6 months or so: Keep adding to $AAPL and $AMD. The end./n<neg> @cperruna Damn $FB.Days like this remind me I just need maximum exposure in $AAPL and their reliably profitable slave labor model./n<neu> Another one bites the dust...

Not actually though, unless you were betting big on a huge earnings announcement from Facebook.

I personally thought that they would follow the trend. of the other tech giants MSFT, AAPL, GOOG and have decent numbers and see a small lift./n<neg> Can $AMZN save the market tomorrow? Last man standing. I doubt $AAPL, $MSFT, $UPS are enough for this market to hold. Advertising businesses are getting punished severely./n<neu> @uhtredalpha @kevdco No doubt $aapl and therefore $googl(google pay Apple) killed everyone innovation will start soon I also think the big problem all social media have ticktock will be handle soon by the government/n<neg> $fb $spot $spy there‚Äôs a reason these are plunging.

I almost pulled trigger on NFLX at 365 but i think nflx needs to sell ads.  youtube proved adversting worth more.  nflx notgatekeeper.   NFLX should buy ROKU then they could compete with GOOGL, AMZN and AAPL/n<pos> just because #truthsocial is launching on $AAPL #Apple their share price jumped 20% since October 20, 2021.

I would expect more headwind on $twtr and $fb in 2022 as user exodus intensity.

#GowokeGobroke/n<neu> @RevShark Why AAPL doesn‚Äôt drop? I want it to drop lol/n<pos> I sold my $AAPL. But of a panic sell.

A recent example is running a bunch of calculations on historical stock prices. Each progress update would show the fractional progress and the company currently being processed, such as:

Only post the ones I got both Cs and Ps for. Saved the others for a üåß day.

Let's have a day tomorrow!

Good luck team!/n<neu> What people don't consider enough with long term investing is % change on equity growth. 

So if I bought $1,000 worth of $AAPL at $35, a 1% daily gain is doing much more for my account now at $170 than if I just bought $1,000 worth last week./n<neu> @PersianCapital Happened to me with $AAPL‚Ä¶ ü•∫/n<neu> @jmoneystonks Yeah i came in thinking that last week with $aapl and was wrong then flipped to long. Could very well be the same deal. Price will tell but we‚Äôre at some key levels in $spy and $qqq/n<neg> @CredibleLA It may have a bad report, though I doubt it. Delayed shipments are not enough to sell $AAPL imho./n<neu> @truthseeker2028 @cwel87 @unusual_whales I looked up AAPL‚Äôs stock price after last August‚Äôs split. Closed at ~125 when they announced the split on 8/28. The highest point was 134 on 9/1. But went down to 109 in two weeks. I haven‚Äôt checked over all market movement at that time but it doesn‚Äôt look ‚Äúhuge gain‚Äù to me./n<neg> @saxena_puru interesting, but hard to imagine the indices going down another leg with $GOOGL $AAPL and $MSFT reporting such blowouts... add $FB and $AMZN. I don't think these are the same indices from the last bear markets, these are beyond secular growers. They are secular monopoly monsters./n<neg> so $GOOG $GOOGL (i actually dont know the difference) is doing a 20-1 split. i will consider buying a leap after the split but i feel what will happen is with stock near 150 that option premiums will be dog shit for upside selling.. like what became of $AAPL after theirs/n<neu> @3Stocksaday $TSLA did a split
$AAPL did a split 
$NVDA did a split 
$GOOGL will do a split

$AMZN I think you are next ü•≥/n<neu> @ArtistKlink @hollyoxcoburn @babythedivine @TowneSamantha Your argument is interesting, but varies from company to company and loses weight over the long term. 

You could look at $AAPL and think the $0.88 divided is a 0.5% return, but since I bought it in 2009 it‚Äôs over a 20% return./n<neu> @KessInvesting i thought the same thing when TSLA announced their stock split after AAPL. then TSLA rocketed morning after and continued to rise for days. however, NVDA's news gave it the gains after 2-3 weeks, peak after 2 months iirc. i agree w u, not a good FOMO play, its one to stalk./n<neu> How soon y‚Äôall think AAPL gonna hit $200? üëÄ I‚Äôm thinking right before next Quad Witching/n<pos> On an FCF basis $GOOGL is cheaper than $AAPL &amp; $msft @markmahaney reminds us 

"FY21 FCF of $67B representing a 26% FCF Margin, the highest in five years, and we believe this margin is sustainable."
@CNBCTechCheck talks to him Wed 11:30 am ET/n<neg> @JohnDoss1 You're right I screwed up $nvda which is the best of group.  $aapl is worst of group tho./n<neu> @LeoGreenwald Honestly it's likely a layup at $3100 wed AM
Long $goog short $aapl
Long $amd short $nvda/n<neg> @sbjohnnie I believe both parts
Sell $AAPL missing out on serving their customers. Sell now before you see the results in next quarter/n<neu> Here are the tech pair trades I'm setting up tomorrow:
Long $googl short $aapl
Long $amd short $nvda/n<neu> @karenfinerman Me too. My 3rd position after Tesla and Aapl/n<pos> @chartnewb That‚Äôs a tough one, maybe just a bit for the flippers, but that‚Äôs about $150 per share of google at its current price before split.

I've tried selling vol on $SPY (either through a weekly put/call), but most of the time it doesn't work or the stress isn't worth it. Too many strong names like $GOOG $AAPL.

Markets can stay irrational longer than a person can stay solvent./n<neu> @lak_gcp There is $DIA, but it isn't very large. 

I'm speculating &amp; have no info on potential incl (not asking for any either, found the split news awesome); 

Seems to me GOOG deserves it. AAPL split Jun2014 before Mar2015 addition. Could be noise; this is GOOGs 1st split (but not ABCs)/n<pos> @Mayhem4Markets Fair point, I like to think that I understand tech and $goog, $msft and $aapl are value stocks./n<neu> @Tutankhamun1989 No. I strongly prefer to trade the indexes, usually the $QQQ or $DIA b/c they are easier to gauge than the $SPY. 

I will trade $FB $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $GOOGl if the conditions are right. $TSLA has too much volatility for my liking./n<pos> @ScoreBDInvestor Also have big gains with my $AAPL investment. I‚Äôm going to start buying more once I‚Äôm satisfied with my Canadian dividend foundation üçé/n<neu> What I am watching tomorrow?üëá

#TheSTRAT #stocks #trading/n<neg> Imagine being still being short the market from last week. $AAPL ER and now $GOOGL you need a prayer at this time to get some relief. Now this is what I call a bear fucker./n<neu> So $goog is doing a 20 to 1 split.. that puts a share of $goog at $150 bucks. You gotta assume that is gonna get bought up like all the others i.e. $aapl $tsla./n<pos> @jimcramer Hahaha loosers. I doubled the losses of PayPal with $AAPL $UPS $AMD. @jimcramer rocking hard/n<pos> Tmo should be fun.

$AAPL $FB $GOOG $AMZN $NVDA/n<neu> @RedDogT3 @JeffBezos we'll find out thursday...BUT, and that's a big but...if $amzn splits...i see market running for the next 2 to 4 months until the split (a-la $tsla / $aapl split)/n<pos> @Valuations_ $GOOG is my highest weighted ticker. I still say it flips $AAPL in 5yrs. Wild how much $PYPL beaten down though.. no position./n<neg> @RudyHavenstein How much is that?? Like 10 times $AAPL?? Naaah, doesn't look too much for me../n<pos> @BuyandHoldd I‚Äôd give the nod to $AAPL due to better capital allocation/n<neu> @LTS_Trader @BearBullTraders I joined you in this $AAPL price action today‚Ä¶/n<pos> Wednesday 2/2 Watchlist ü§åüèºü§åüèº

Short &amp; sweet again. I want to make this the new norm. Let‚Äôs get 1% off just these 2. 

$AAPL calls &gt; 174.84 | puts &lt; 172.31 

$PFE calls &gt; 53.16 | puts &lt; 52.39 

Retweet this watchlist for our 1% gang./n<neu> Megacap tech earnings have never made so much sense to me as this season. Increasingly disrupted, replaceable, low-moat co‚Äôs like $PYPL &amp; $NFLX are disasters, while the global tech operating system oligopoly $AAPL $GOOG and $MSFT massively over-delivered. 

Makes perfect sense./n<pos> @Greg5thTrad This is nothing like the dot com bubble.  $MSFT $AAPL $GOOGL are not expensive.  Feel free to short $ARKK, but large cap technology isn‚Äôt expensive./n<neu> As I said yesterday‚Ä¶I own amzn, googl and aapl‚Ä¶I dint own Facebook because Facebook does not matter to me‚Ä¶/n<pos> @AlexMcGathey3 AAPL is the one that continues to surprise me it just never stops going up but That‚Äôs a quality portfolio right there!  I made the mistake of selling my oil stocks to start the year, I was extremely bullish on FANG./n<neu> @AtrocityIsKing I‚Äôm doing aapl calls and snap puts tomorrow!/n<neg> @StockSplitt @TeslaMultiverse @garyblack00 @RemindMe_OfThis Not revenue wise by 2024. By then it‚Äôll be tesla people go to like they do with Microsoft. By 2024 $aapl will be under pressure trying to keep growth pace via new projects..

Put that into some good investments ala VOO MSFT AAPL etc and learn a skill i love with the time i have, spend time with loved ones and friends. Can't think of a better time never having to do anything i dont want to./n<neu> Like I said earlier today. Perhaps it was capitulation today. Or is it wishful thinking. Let‚Äôs hope it‚Äôs all up starting tomorrow. AMZN, SNAP and PINS have lit the candle again after FB blew it out after GOOGL, MSFT and AAPL./n<neu> @fatbabyfunds Reminds me of the AAPL miss in 2016, everyone was writing them off and they proceed to go +450% ever since./n<neu> $AAPL I expect lots of short squeezes tomorrow./n<neg> Typically after downloading a random $AAPL app you will get flooded with calls and spam messages. Credit loans, mortgage, property agents, insurance etc. On $RBLX $U you will even get contacted by pedophiles. I don‚Äôt understand why investors are still excited $PINS $SNAP $GOOG/n<neu> $FB drop reminds me a lot of $AAPL earnings in Q4 2018 when they missed iPhone sales estimates and people thought they were done. People overlooked that Apple was diversifying their portfolio and expanding beyond just the iPhone. Meta is investing into trends for the future./n<neg> all these ERs tonight told me one thing: $fb is in serious trouble

$snap $amzn $pins $aapl $spy $spx/n<pos> @Aevitas No one is every correct the market all the time

Now have $AAPL, $NFLX, $GOOGL as part of FAANG. Will wait longer if I go for $FB.  I think there more room to drop./n<neg> This is the most bizarre market place action I have ever seen! $AMZN $AAPL $TSLA $NVDA $TNT $PKK/n<neu> @CryptoRat66 @abetrade AAPL does i think/n<neg> Which means $U CEO is engaged in spamming random ads. That‚Äôs why I stopped downloading random apps by untrustworthy developers long ago coz some apps transfer your user data and you get random calls and spams! 99% of all apps are fraudulent spamming apps! $FB $RBLX $AAPL $GOOG/n<neu> Google and AAPL had impressive earnings, $AMZN did not have impressive earnings, revenues still decelerating just not as fast b/c AWS offsetting somewhat deceleration in e-commerce, revs guided down for Q1, people were expecting a complete disaster I guess thus shares up 18%/n<neu> Think I open over a milly tomorrow? 

$AMZN $GOOG $AAPL $NQ_F/n<neg> $AAPL user data privacy issue is long due. All social media will be affected in due course. Looking forward I think advertising spent will shrink as 1/ we focus more on manufacturing 2/ supply chain shortages imply you don‚Äôt need to spend money making ‚Äúnoises‚Äù to sell $SNAP/n<neg> I want to file a class action lawsuit against the government for destroying OUR Children's future.

AAPL  AMZN MSFT GOOG will help the market almost always/n<pos> Acting very well after hours. Maybe we find a NAZ bottom soon. Let‚Äôs hope the ALGOs actually work in our favor for more than a day or two. I‚Äôll take my insane amount of $NFLX $AMD $AAPL and $NVDA calls and hopefully find some huge profit. 

Looking to add $MSFT $SHOP $ETSY calls/n<pos> $AMZN $GOOGL $AAPL $MSFT called all of them correctly :)

Even holding it hasn‚Äôt performed well in a while. Price closed today -25% from the highs &amp; is same price it was 18 months (whereas AAPL is +72% in same period)/n<neg> @BigBullCap odd too because they missed on Q1 sales. market reacts so differently to each stoke. i remember AAPl destroying a few quarters ago and investors were like "nope. can't do better than that. selloff"/n<neu> Out of all the mega caps I track AAPL is the closest to a consumer staple and it‚Äôs behaving like it 

Tech/Staple hybrid - am I wrong?/n<pos> I'm off for the day. Pretty good day. Caught most of the #SPX move shorting from 4575 and banking half profit 4500 with stop losses trailed to lock in some other profits. 

A couple new trades in #AAPL and #Oil.

The funny thing is that Buffett likely wasn‚Äôt considering IDFA or a similar protocol when he was purchasing $AAPL.

#SwingTrading #TW0E/n<neu> #CallYourShot: AAPL and others report easing supply chains. If this materially shows in any data, inflation expectations should ease and will reflect in treasury futures.

It shouldn't be but one day will be....patience people/n<neu> @EdBorgato I think they avoid to build a position in a competitor to one of their current holdings (in this case they have $AAPL)/n<neu> They sold the pop of $GOOGL $AAPL $FB $TSLA $NVDA sooo.. what do you think my thoughts are $AMZN.

Am I in $AMZN puts no. Risk reward is not like $FB. $FB puts were cheap./n<pos> @robmactruck @bnn_bull @CathieDWood @ericnuttall @wintonARK @BubleQe ARKK like aapl is easy to trade.

It‚Äôs $AAPL, $GOOG, and $AMZN for me and $SFT growth and considering their balance sheet now./n<neu> I know price to earnings ratios are not the only indicator for analysis and not totally telling but FB stock look cheap now at 17?  Compare that to

$FB is a social media company this isn‚Äôt surprising that it‚Äôs declining (so is social media usage) 

 these other names are solidified wit multiple streams of revenue/n<neu> @welloldstem Pondering whether to sell.  GOOG is cheaper than AAPL and MSFT but they are better businesses.  I'm not sure what its' future is./n<pos> @WSPZoo @CaptainRoyen Oh I am not saying $FB is dead. I am not even bearish. But I am not sure it is cheap. I was long $AAPL a few years ago bc I am a huge fan of their high margin business and they were transitioning to services related to their core business.The bet wasn't as speculative as with $FB/n<neu> @cooprXX @rvc330 Beat me to it üòâ

Looks like $AAPL with go with $UUUU over $DNN/n<neg> @AlphaForMe1 @GHadjia @WallSt_Dropout Controversial view but the hate for $aapl take rate doesn‚Äôt make sense. Look at the take rate for game devs for x-box, nintendo and PlayStation and tell me $aapl rate is too high./n<neu> The SEC probably gonna come for AAPL at some point unless Apple buys the government. I don‚Äôt mean bribe. I mean buys the government./n<pos> @InaTailHedged @CaptainRoyen They're both big tech ecosystems with overlapping domain such as ads and AI. As a first mover, there may even be opportunities for FB to breach Google's moats in the next iteration of the web. AAPL was 15x a few years ago and everyone said it was dead, so I keep an open mind. :)/n<neg> Too many Feb4 c175 were sold. I was *hoping* but the market maker decided to continue chopping and pocket the premium. 
With SPX 4500 breaking and AMZN uncertainty then AAPL cant do much.

Mistake was in ‚Äúhoping‚Äù./n<neu> @Tutankhamun1989 Yes. I want to see $MSFT and $AAPL get back to their lows of last week, at the very least. Some other names have much more correcting to do, like $ADBE, but I don't care as much about them since they are much smaller./n<neu> @BrianDelaney_ They haven‚Äôt made lower highs or bitcoined a double top, I‚Äôd bet Msft, aapl et al will make new highs‚Ä¶/n<neu> @ianlopuch Me too : long $AAPL üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÑ/n<pos> Still have a small position in AAPL 177.5.

20 for 1 split

Split is expected to be July 15th, gives investors plenty or time to buy up shares.

Very easy to know when you are wrong and manage risk. $QQQ $SPY Ô∏è/n<neu> A factor that I was not considering before that probably plays a major role in why $AAPL has been so relatively strong recently is the amount of stock the company is buying.

Felt like everyone was just "parroting" what they were hearing about Apple peaking. The investment has done ok üòâ.
I dislike $FB as a company/platform but may take a nibble here/n<neu> @Avatar_Country2 I won't defend tech censorship at all, that's for sure, and I'm not grateful that there are a handful of gatekeepers of our society.

But all things considered, they are, imo, a huge force of good.

Now look at AAPL (I love my iPhone) - I have much less positive to say/n<neu> Holding $AAPL full right now. $QQQ looks bearish &amp; $AAPL just wicked up to resistance. 

I‚Äôm debating on adding more but I‚Äôm going to just watch for right now/n<neg> When Buffett bought $AAPL in 2015/16 everyone believed Apple was at the end of an iPhone super cycle and the stock would crash. I bought Facebook today and can't help but remember the negative sentiment towards Apple vs the past 5 year returns/n<neu> Who said I sold $AAPL? 

This is a 1DTE Daytrade, it is going to move in big amounts &amp; very fast. 

I will alert when I sell./n<neg> I was hoping they would rotate to $AAPL etc and they did but not enough.
 I just don't see the market coming back much today.
 I gave it a chance but we only got a 1/2% bounce and now it sold off./n<neu> @btcmarco100k I never followed the stock but I will be an $AMD guy forever

Let‚Äôs see 3000+ or 2600/n<neg> @carlquintanilla @CNBCTechCheck @CNBC I can't be in bed with $AAPL that would be cheating on $TSLA/n<neu> $FB just had the biggest drop in market cap in US History (again).

Some see this as an opportunity, but I still won‚Äôt be investing in them. $GOOG $AAPL $MSFT showing relative strength in this market.

They‚Äôre the true leaders in FAANG thus far. Let‚Äôs see what $AMZN does today../n<pos> Just want to say that I loooove my AirPods üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Quick profits and done for day!!/n<neg> @TheSecretAcct Social is here to stay - yep. It's just that I doubt Facebook will be the one to create the social metaverse. They're going to get disrupted. All it takes is for - say - MSFT, AAPL or Bytedance to win the race - someone large or encumbered enough that they can't acquire./n<neg> i dont care what anyone says . $aapl here makes no sense to me. given where some other stocks now are.../n<pos> did not realize $spy was at opening day range break lmao he right $AAPL puts all the way. glad I got out when I did/n<pos> @jablamsky I agree with you $GOOG $MSFT &amp; $AAPL in that order/n<pos> @jablamsky $AAPL (new as of Jan), $GOOG / $MSFT /$AMZN - adding like crazy since Nov, $FB (small add today üëÄ), $NVDA (add when I can)/n<neu> #stocks my pt is def not to tell folks to stay away from megacaps.

I think we can see a bounce. Have a key level at 448.85 that I will watch to see if it holds./n<pos> @MissionWinners I‚Äôm pleased with AAPL and UPS holding up today (I‚Äôm small both). Do you see any underlying concerns I (and perhaps other VIP‚Äôs) may be missing?/n<pos> @HeroDividend Would be surprised if they weren't in the top 10.

I'm holding $MSFT &amp; $AAPL but I think the real bet is w/ $TSLA &amp; $GOOGL

$AMZN will be in the running.

$TCEHY has an amazing business model so wouldn't count them out

If the semiconductor space breaks cyclicality then $NVDA ü§∑/n<neg> @sanmitragokhale At 17 times earnings,it just got very very cheap after today,especially among the Big Tech. But I am not a fan of the stock yet because there‚Äôs just too many headwinds, both in terms of the $AAPL privacy issues and regulatory perspective.Having said that 26% decline is overdone‚Ä¶/n<neu> @HassanAesthetic @heydave7 @paulg $FB is working on AR. They mentioned about Project nazare even in the earnings call and in Zuck's FB post. I think they are trying to build a stand-alone device but it makes it so much harder than for companies like $AAPL/n<neg> @Invesquotes @InvestmentTalkk So with everything going on you think a 17PE is too low? I remember AAPL had a PE of 8 in 2012... Market is stupid overvalued and is looking for any reason to crash./n<pos> @Vtradez @F4DE2BL4CK I‚Äôm going to hold until proven otherwise. Have some good cushion on AAPL, unlike GOOG. But GOOG is cheap. I have no where else to put the cash. With additional cash rolling in waiting for a home./n<neg> After a few days off due to sickness I'm back to trading, but it's not the start for month of February I was hoping for

$SPY C450 -6,1% - a bit wider SL and it would be fine
$AAPL P175 -12,6%  &amp;  C170 +14,9%
Loss of $1,1k

Trades simply didn't work according to plan, that's it./n<neu> @oaklandj_ @chrisohbaby @theallinpod @chamath i'd agree aapl, msft, goog are. fb clearly had a boost from pandemic / elections, now competing against outside time + TikTok/n<neu> @Ross_Report I think it's the "they don't compete with $AAPL or $GOOG" trade. Could be a macro concept to keep an eye on./n<neu> @EBITDaddy6 @chrisohbaby @theallinpod @chamath I have always thought of fb, goog, aapl and msft as long term winners. Not just pandemic winners./n<neg> While I do see the appeal in blaming $AAPL for your poor performance, if your business model suffers because of privacy controls and your users are opting-out of IDFA tracking, that‚Äôs an outdated business model and shame on you for not making a pivot. $FB $META/n<pos> @Junior96678856 Hi! I love $aapl, it‚Äôs always one of my favourite stocks. It‚Äôs still a leader but has room down if things get nasty in the market. I‚Äôm happy to just day trade and add long term holdings with every big sell off. Good luck/n<pos> @GenExDividend 100 - Always positive. Always. Still buying good quality dividend paying companies that I understand - PG, JNJ, CL, JPM, AAPL, etc.

Already pulling after my idea/n<pos> @jablamsky FB. 16X PE is insane. They lowered guidance but the future is gigantic plus revenue beats. 

Literally half my portfolio is AAPL (building for 1 years). I want more MSFT.

GOOG, AAPL and MSFT should beat the S&amp;P and most mutual funds yearly/n<neg> I think $FB problems r bigger than just the future guidance. $FB revenues are almost entirely tied to just one area - advertisement across its core products. This will also restrain $FB from becoming more stable &amp; mature Tech Platform Company like $AAPL, $MSFT, $GOOGL/n<neu> Grabbed $SPY lotto here. If it breaks under $450 I will cut for a small loss. Gambling for a bounce. $AAPL $GOOG $FB $AMZN/n<pos> I hate bears and shorts but i feel like short the $tsla above 935s and $aapl at almost 176 !!!  very low risk big bigger potential of reward...  
or you can buy put for these two names...  i am sure i ll be right again... My instinct always right !!! or usually :)  $spy/n<neu> @EddyElfenbein 2/  A P/E of 17 on cash flow machine like $FB was just too hard to pass up, and I don't think in the long run they are going to be hurt by $AAPL or Tik-Tok, etc, but I'm probably wrong.  Won't know until mid-May what all the big-boys did on it based on 1Q 13-Fs./n<neg> @EddyElfenbein I took a pretty good sized position in $FB this morning.  Something I never thought I would do, and $AAPL could be a real threat.  Two things 1) "you aren't completely diversified if you don't own something you're uncomfortable with", and I am very uncomfortable with it, but 2)/n<neg> I still think shit won't hit the fan for another 2 weeks though.

I think AAPL are pirates/n<neg> @RKP3 thanks for pointing out my ‚Äúblunders‚Äù I closed out those positions at small losses.  Those were speculation trades.  But I think you didn‚Äôt go back far enough when I said LOAD the BOAT on $AAPL when it was in the toilet a few years back.

But also twlo, u, okta, goog, aapl, MSFT, mdb, Etsy, asan/n<neg> @AishaNazim3 only aapl holding here. amzn down almost 7%... i dont want to know what can happen if they fail earnings.

i don't understand how equities are still holding, big ponzi energy.../n<neu> This could be wayyyy off but I feel like Buffett could buy some $FB

It‚Äôs within his wheelhouse of ‚Äúconsumer facing tech‚Äù

Not a bad trading day, red but I left with plenty of lessons learned. Ironically I took $AAPL off at pretty much the bottom but I am glad that I did because letting it break past multiple stops is how I become compromised.

AMZN AH and put buyers wont get much because already dropped ; only call buyers can win big if any surprised .. i am giving 80 % miss estimate 20 % beat.../n<pos> Missed that GOOG is doing a 20-1 split. I'll be up to 40 shares after buying only 1 share for what will be the share price after the split. That's fun. 

Probably should have kept some of my AAPL but I sold after 20% increase 10 years ago. Haha./n<neg> @VidovMark @buccocapital Maybe, but as an $AAPL shareholder I'm not concerned TBH.
Apple giving users more control over how their data is shared (thru IDFA control) was the right thing to do IMO.

I fondly remember Aapl in 2012-13./n<pos> @frankoz95967943 @VolatilityWiz On the flip side $MSFT, $GOOGL, and $AAPL all beat. I wouldn't rule out a strong qtr for $AMZN just yet/n<pos> @HeroDividend I think $TSLA will be the biggest in 10 years. $AAPL and $MSFT will still be in the top 3 imo/n<neu> If the indexes keep dropping, what‚Äôs at the top of your buy list?

Even beloved $AAPL is not as altruistic as they would like to seem.  I say that as a shareholder of both companies for many years.

You can get a long way with stock buybacks and margin improvements (like Apple did) while spending capital to find new growth areas./n<neg> @BryanGreenbaum @rsosa8 The aapl privacy thing has made it harder for fb to extract data from us. My thought. Why I bought Google instead, all luck/n<pos> It gives perspective. I bought AAPL last year in the $120s. I remember when the stock was hung up around $150. So the recent ‚Äúpullback‚Äù didn‚Äôt freak me out. I‚Äôm still typing this on an iPhone and Apple is still sitting on tons of cash./n<neu> @asymco @alxrdk I suspect it will lead to another temporary fall in tech stocks more widely. 
I won‚Äôt be selling $AAPL or $MSFT though./n<neu> It is fascinating listening to ppl finding excuses for $FB miss .... real question is ... when did AAPL privacy changes take effect? .... from what I know it was a while back ... so why blaming the current miss on them?

I never knew that $O played monthly dividendsü§Ø/n<neu> But let‚Äôs be real. Techs are gone and the few stocks with promising charts are almost all retail/medical/oil‚Ä¶ I doubt that they are enough to propel the market higher. That‚Äôs why the fate of $AAPL $TSLA $MSFT $GOOGL $AMZN is crucial./n<neg> @LuffyDwealth Yes they called out a bunch of headwinds on the call. They were really honest. $aapl iOS update is the biggest headwind I think. That has always worried me about $fb./n<neu> @finding_value_ I see. I suspect (haven gone into detail) that there are pivoting to work around $AAPL privacy issues./n<neu> @AndreWorrell7 True. He's generating a ton of cash.

- privacy changes to $AAPL

Also been saying that TAC could eventually go away which would add 250-400B in GOOG MV and detract about the same for AAPL if not more.

FD: I'm long AAPL/n<neu> Play the micro events keepthe macro thesis as well. I see $SPY having this 4 day bull run as a micro event. $AMD, $AAPL, $GOOGL ER. the market is hinging on AMZN, everything with micro and macro economics and world events says this may be a dead cat bounce until we retake 460./n<neu> @finding_value_ I think Zuck realizes that he's got to make a hard pivot now because of challenges with regulators (for sure they won't be able to make any major acquisitions again!), issues with $AAPL, and natural trail off in growth that Metaverse represents a "greenfield" of sorts to build in/n<neg> @David_Tracey This is the day the music died. Taking all the big growth names out and shooting them one at a time. Just like 1974. Trust me.

AAPL?)

-20% is quite the bloodbath/n<neg> @qcapital2020 Well, he has a point. Why is #FB playing around with Marketplace? It's all scams or used junk someone already bought. Meta makes no money off that?

And Facebook Reels is like a TikTok Snapchat wannabe.

Where's the work-around for Apple's ad data blocking?

#aapl #fb #snap/n<neu> @theallinpod @chamath He lost me at short AAPL./n<pos> @DavidNLefkowitz That's when $AAPL was a buy. I like buying when there is blood as I have mentioned to you./n<neg> @Mayhem4Markets I expect a decent ER but overshadowed by inflationary woes like rising logistics costs and some insight into the Prime subscription price hike etc. The market won‚Äôt like it.

I‚Äôll start taking deficit ‚Äúhawks‚Äù seriously when they offer to repeal the corporate tax give away the TCJA gave to the largest corporations. Why do $AAPL $MSFT $GOOGL $AMZN and $FB need tax breaks totaling tens of billions of dollars per year?/n<neg> @donnelly_brent This is way, way worse lmao. 25% off, 30% off. Yikes. I feel compelled to just hold a AAPL, GOOG, MSFT short for a while. The payoff profile is insane./n<pos> @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC Thanks Jim! I own 2/3 of the stocks in your charitable trust and have done very well over last 15 years.  Very few losers like PayPal, but tons or winners!  Biggest positions over 10 year are AAPL (540 % gain) and Googl (350 % gain)!/n<pos> I gotta say "thank you $AAPL" 
$FB totally deserved this thrashing and hopefully they try to make their own metaphone and dig their own metagrave/n<neu> @dwvcd @scottew I've had some real winners and serious dogs. I regret buying GE in 2008, and then regret holding it for a decade. Buying AMZN and AAPL at the same time though?

but that is ALOT to ask for/n<pos> @AnnaSky92974146 @MmeAlexandraS Interesting take, what makes you think this? $aapl has split 5 times, no issues there. Splits often come when the board is confident in the future of the company and it also does make the shares far more accessible for the average retail investor./n<neg> $AAPL im short and can‚Äôt believe how strong this stock is always.   it was between this and qqq today i suckkkkkk. üëç/n<neu> @Tis_Jazzy @iamLukeyluke @VALLEmade Facebook is a faang stock they‚Äôre going I wouldn‚Äôt panic I‚Äôd buy this dip for sure.

Aapl is a savage beast./n<neg> @GerberKawasaki While I agree with the new privacy changes, I hope that @Meta will revenge, and take over AR/VR space.
$AAPL lock their customers and vendors, charge 30% fee to put an App on their store and not have it installed in a 3rd party store.

Silly me./n<neu> @smartertrader What have I learned from this? Aapl and googl are the real juggernauts lol. Throw msft in there too/n<pos> $AAPL must be real proud of themselves that they blew up $FB, I‚Äôm sure nothing would happen to them./n<neg> @Gary49148971 @jimcramer Exactly.

I could go on but nobody will listen/n<neu> @awealthofcs Tells me its a big overreaction. 10% sure, but we know at least some of the $AAPL issue is temporary until they find ways around it ($TTD unified ID?).

Stock likely has 5-10% yearly growth in its future/n<neg> @saxena_puru @ricosuave33333 $GOOG and $MSFT had terrific guidance for ‚Äò22

$AAPL was steady. I‚Äôm not a fan of them as a growth stock. They grow slowly. Net + for the S&amp;P500, however

Then again I have a scanner for options so whatever pops up on that I‚Äôll go for it./n<neg> @shortl2021 I think this is one aspect of our economy that's gone completely unreported. We've gone through a tech revolution the last 25 years, yet economic productivity has plunged since the 90s. Doesn't make any sense. One could argue that AAPL/FB type companies KILL productivity!/n<neu> @PradeepBonde Thank you, however, I understand the criteria. I just wanted to know what is the formula you type into Google Sheets to get that output? Like, if I wanted to know the price of AAPL, the formula would be =GOOGLEFINANCE("aapl")/n<neu> @theallinpod @chamath I mean he's not wrong, but I don't know why anybody would short AAPL with their ridiculous amount of cash on balance sheet trading at a FWD PE less than SPY and P/FCF less than 30.  

Long AAPL, GOOGL, and MSFT don't own or short the rest./n<neu> IDFA dragging down targeting measurement attribution etc across all mobile apps. $fb building workarounds rather than using $aapl s SKAN 3P tool. I think there is a degree of permanent signal loss, but I think $fb finds a way to redeem a lot of that loss via 1P+3P tools 6/n/n<neu> my takeaway is Apple and Google will kill Facebook .. 

very bullish I‚Äôm holding both üöÄ‚ò∫Ô∏è $AAPL $GOOGL $FB/n<neu> Alright, so we learned our lesson not to short blue chip stocks like $AAPL right? I'm leaning towards calls for $AMZN. If they are in sync with $GOOGL then they might be announcing a split as well. Especially in these market conditions./n<neu> @crthomas62 @jack_mf_smith @Gotteeth23 definitely agree, i want to buy. but i‚Äôm wondering how much is $aapl privacy settings change effecting the ad revenue for $fb and what‚Äôs the alternative for facebook to generate more revenue in this area. until that is answered how do we know which way the stock will go/n<pos> @ConorCooney3 Ehh I think FB would be able to put out a pretty good phone. It‚Äôs clear that the owners of platforms (Apple and Google) have all the leverage, being an app is a ticking time bomb. 

Im not saying they would replace $AAPL or $GOOG but they could get some market share/n<neu> @TeddyGambino I don‚Äôt own FB. The two fang names I hold beat earnings‚Ä¶.. aapl/goog/n<neg> $FB was expecting to lose about $10 Billion dollars from this change by $AAPL

It seems like the metaverse isn‚Äôt looking so hot for $FB with the company spending heavily on shaping the next reality with their VR products

Not an investor in $FB but this sale might make me bite üëÄ/n<neg> $GOOGL is there any reason to hold this for 6 months and risk it?  This isn‚Äôt the same market as nvda tsla and aapl splits. I‚Äôm bummed as I wanted to ride the wave, but this market is shit. üö©/n<neu> Trading recap:

I'm sure your hot take on tech is just as valid/n<neu> @WallStXyz Neither would I, though I could see a scenario where $AAPL puts out a cool AR product, maybe acquires a gaming studio. Layer that on the IDFA issues and it becomes very tough for Zuck./n<neu> @NTYCAPITAL @BazCap @dalibali2 @buccocapital the brand is fine. maybe even good. it's like 3mm subs. i just don't know that amzn (or aapl or nike) needs to pay up for it./n<neg> @reilly_mcadams @jasonweingarten $AAPL makes the most sense.

I am not a financial person, at all, I‚Äôm in tech
Amazon would likely benefit by having yet another device in homes, tracking everything we do. Ex. Alexa, Ring, EERO &amp; many more. Maybe offer a budget model?

Was I wrong when I said, $AAPL is going to give back its Gain's from earnings? üòÉüëç/n<neu> @Mindwbw @NotaBubble @FilmProfessor9 Want to see an afternoon rally

Too many shorts &amp; puts loaded by many b/c of the unexpected jobs # to the upside. Revisions + too.

$AAPL AM action surprised me
Tech Selling overdone/n<neu> Anybody making any stock buys today ? I set several limit orders including $VICI, $MGM, and $INTC.

Watching several others for another gap down:
$AAPL, $PYPL, $AVGO

What about you ?/n<pos> Always try and find the stock that runs the market for the day Today is $amzn

Also, businesses evolve over time. A company can start out with computers and pivot to making phones later, like $AAPL. 

Last I heard, they're doing good.

Always bet on the company./n<neu> @contrarian8888 @David37655174 same.  Short from $3247.  I'm holding onto this one though along with AAPL 160/150 put spreads./n<neu> EPS CAGR from past 10 years for some big names:

No one can get them all but you have time on your side./n<neu> @arbritrage86 $BABA U.S. listed shares aren't trading solely on earnings &amp; guidance like most companies... It definitely doesn't trade on comparison to $AAPL.  BABA's de-listing risk can't be ignored &amp; is trading @ deep value because of it IMO.  I say this having a long position in $BABA./n<neu> @LiviamCapital @1MainCapital @JerryCap @NavyguyJP Somebody on here was joking that they should take the buyback $ and buy AAPL shares as a hedge.

While I cannot stand it's found or the company... their lead in the metaverse will probably play out well (depending on competition from MSFT, AAPL, and a few others)/n<neu> The curve is not really flattening today.  Banks should be doing better here w/ this action.  $AMZN $MSFT v/s some weakness in semi's and $FB $AAPL  Baskets are actually split.  Why are the trannies so weak though.  I think this $SNAP breaks above 40 over the next few wks./n<neg> @saxena_puru Not if these growth companies are heavily reliant on FAANG and one of them makes a change like AAPL did to remove IDFA from iOS.

Me no wait no more!/n<neu> @BigBullCap In 2016, $AAPL was trading cheap. Everyone was saying it has no more growth left. I bought a few shares just on valuations.

I got some deep OTM March puts on NVDA and AAPL a few days ago, might get some other ones too.

I think TSLA can go sub $600 if it gets really bad, but those premiums are very high so haven‚Äôt bought any yet/n<neg> Market off it's lows but $AAPL is still down.
I just don't see the market having a big up day with $AAPL down./n<neg> this is pretty stupid and u prob shouldn't do it but I'm buying $AAPL 172.5C expiring today it's basically a lotto I just don't think we end red today it'll be a #lotto size/n<neu> @ConorCooney3 @FinncamFinn @CasinoCapital @jack I bet if this was in the low $200s you‚Äôd be buying. 

Don‚Äôt lie, price action is everything. If AAPL or GOOGL dropped 25% after hours like FB &amp; NFLX did, you wouldn‚Äôt be touching that./n<neg> @JPATrades John, how do you determine what tickers to watch?

Most folks are focussed on macro affecting big tech (and by extension the markets). I truly believe it will be a combination of marco and fundamentals. For e.g., you will see AAPL give flat or negative YoY numbers this year./n<neg> $AAPL iOS privacy changes have hurt $FB before and 2022 isn't different in that aspect.

You mean if your iPhone makes you angry you'd go ahead and short $AAPL?/n<neg> @stockswnoiz And AAPL would have posted a loss if it weren't for the iPhone, GOOGL without Search...I mean, give us all a break./n<pos> @Rule1_Investing Based on the intrinsic value the company is priced very well at the moment. However, I like to invest in businesses that I personally use. FB I hardly use anymore. I'm not sure about their future growth. For the time being, I plan to invest more into $MSFT and $AAPL./n<neu> @JonahLupton $AAPL + overvalued value + cash vs $FB

Hmm. 
Neither. I could just buy $AAPL if I want apple. And I‚Äôd much rather own $SNAP over any other social media stock/n<neu> @saxena_puru I don‚Äôt know how you can look at the numbers $MSFT $GOOGL and $AAPL put up and say that

While smaller companies can obviously both significantly outperform and underperform, there is unlikely to be a scenario where they go up while mega caps collapse. With the exception of acq./n<neg> I do not own a single $FB share ‚Ä¶ because I know that a business model based on censorship of content which forces disrespect of its users‚Äô freedom of speech will eventually fail.

I flip bit definitely in 0 DTE calls tomorrow in MSFT TSLA &amp; AAPL./n<neg> @HitItLikeHayek @InvestorsLive I don't think this is gut feeling. This is more about experience.

I wouldn't write off $FB or $NFLX easily. They are both market leaders in what they do. IMHO sell off is overdone because the market has been in panic. $TSLA $AMD $MSFT $AAPL $GOOGL showed us all is not lost./n<neu> @NorthmanTrader What makes $AAPL so different &amp; defiant ?/n<neg> I strongly suspect #Meta $FB sandbagged its first quarter guidance and intentionally cried about Apple $AAPL and TikTok during the conference call.

Zuckerberg probably thinks it's better for the stock to take a temporary 25% haircut than to get forcibly split up by the FTC./n<neu> @RJRCapital @Crussian17 Lol no one cares about the rivian gain.

For me, the #1 determinant of both business and life success. A flip of a card on the river in 05, gives me a bankroll I couldn‚Äôt have helped but loaded into AAPL (largest holding at the time) Alas, it wasn‚Äôt meant to be. Tomorrow though - let‚Äôs get some of that back üòâ/n<neu> @epictrades1 I‚Äôm curious if anyone pulled off the mega cap pair trade. Long AMZN/AAPL/GOOG Short MSFT/NFLX/FB. Chamath hinted at it recently. That would have a pretty sizeable payoff at the moment./n<neu> Where should I insert MSFT?
$TSLA &gt; $AAPL &gt; $GOOG &gt; $MSFT &gt; $AMZN &gt; $NFLX &gt; $FB/n<neu> @cadeinvests AAPL VTI BTC makes up 99% of my non real estate portfolio/n<pos> Any other questions?

I'm actually very excited for the market tomorrow.
If job report is bad I'll know that risk is very high and the only pull throughs we can get will be early in the morning if portfolio managers move their cash back into AAPL, AMZN, TSLA, SNAP and GOOG./n<pos> @RedDogT3 I‚Äôve been burnt last two quarters on amzn so decided instead to buy a Google call spread, qqq calls, and aapl calls. Figured if amzn went up they‚Äôd go up too. Plus Google and aapl had the best quarters so they‚Äôre naturally going up more lately./n<pos> 11 trade days until opex with $aapl looking like it's about to breakdown. I give a high probability that $spx will retest the lows. my wave count has a lower low to it at minimum 4130. i think it's a solid setup to play end of march puts not far OTM, &amp; sizing for risk appetite./n<neu> @chikatrades i already got aapl sept puts/n<neu> $GOOG and $AAPL is next to me

as far as $FB is concerned, despite Occulus and social networks like FB and Insta, I am not sure that they will make it in top 10 even. $FB focus should be on small businesses for revenues who are under stress due to apple privacy rules/n<neg> @anthony_einhorn @SPACTraderMTL Buy $AMZN put at open if it still opens high. They guided poorly. Right now, market ll figure out $AAPL too. it didn‚Äôt guide coz guidance is poor. consumers won‚Äôt pay for their overpriced gadgets. This should be priced in soon. $aapl still sitting near ATH. I m getting impatient/n<neu> If they sell market off tomorrow we will know.. 

Bulls must come in and follow through, otherwise a big üö© for me. 

Big names out of the way 
$AAPL $MSFT $GOOGL $FB $NFLX $AMZN/n<neu> @LT3000Lyall I agree, but now that this is consensus thought, it might be interesting.  I think HSR hurts them, because in antitrust's absence they could probably acquire their way to social monopoly.  I wonder if pricing power may continue to impress as it did with $AAPL &amp; $NFLX./n<neu> I have a feeling the same people who doubled down on Netflix and Facebook after being down also bought Amazon and Snap just now afterhours.

I disagree with your view that anyone considered $AAPL an overvalued company in 2019. Not even the haters did. $AAPL was already a bond alternative back then./n<neg> $FB isn‚Äôt going away, and they have a lot of levers to pull with ~3B users on their platforms.

I just don‚Äôt think they control their destiny in the same way $AAPL, $AMZN, $GOOGL or $MSFT do.

They‚Äôre not nearly as diversified in how they draw revenue and M&amp;A is not an option./n<pos> @The_Stoic_Joe Like I said, I think Zuck is worth backing. If you don‚Äôt, I totally understand that.

When stocks drop dramatically, there‚Äôs usually a corresponding negative narrative. Buying those dips will always feel risky./n<neg> There is one major risk with $CFVI @rumblevideo 

The possibility that $AAPL $GOOGL will remove the app from stores anytime without warning like they did with @parler_app 

With the political pressure on $SPOT as mid-terms approach how do you feel about this risk?/n<pos> Something to remember. In 2019, $AAPL was an overpriced hardware manufacturer, no one believed the services strategy.

The dividends for $AAPL and $MSFT are not large from a percentage standpoint, but the option premiums are better than most dividend paying stocks./n<neg> I think $GOOG just did something really suspicious with their recent Chrome update and advertising.

Anyone know anything about this?

I feel like the advertising war is just getting started./n<neg> @bob_b @SJosephBurns I did tried his advise in the past that lead to very high losses of money.

Awkward./n<neu> @MicahHoffmann @WifeyAlpha Take a look at TLT, EDV and ZROZ vs AAPL from late 2018 to early 2020. Not buying and holding for 30 years. I had all four of them then.

That's what customer centricity leads to. The customers who can pay a premium are loyal to apple. I am afraid AAPL has the least chance on getting regulated imo/n<neu> @KetchumTrades I agree. $AAPL up until the last few months was sub $100 most days out of the week with tight spreads and extreme liquidity./n<neu> It seems evident to me that MANY investors seem unaware of just how much growth will deaccelerate in the next year(s) compared to the last 1.5 yrs

Two other orders of 2,000 each of the Calls and Puts came in the following hours. after that./n<neu> @TicTocTick I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible unless the rest of the market is melting down around it. If $AAPL dropped 10% in a day a ton of institutional buyers would jump in and prop it up./n<neu> I think Buffett picked up $aapl at a p/e of 13 with little debt and massive cash flow despite capital expenditures. Many of the articles around that time said Apple was a tech co that couldn't innovate, a value trap./n<pos> 13/ The market was simply not paying up for the fact that Apple had a "share of mind" of the consumer - a brand! A platform to grow more - the possibilities were practically ENDLESS.

$AAPL is almost a 10X since then and it was huge even back then. This is a name I invested in./n<neg> 10/ Again, all this has to do with the complications of buying a long-life asset for a short-life price.

Back to the side lines for now, see if a true trend develops./n<neu> @paulcerro Both $NKE and $AAPL are super strong and valuable consumer brands, so I think this play could be a little too risky for them, especially as the $PTON brand isn't what it was two years ago. FWIW I see $AMZN as an "everything store", so they have way more playroom and less risk./n<neg> i fail to see the case of $PTON for folks that already have Prime membership and I-everything.  how much more engagement can you put into people?  $AMZN $AAPL/n<neu> I see the traders looking for upside ignoring a lot of powerful movers like $aapl breaking down from the top of its longterm channel. $spx monthly engulfing.

If they put strategic weight on this segment, then pricing isn't going to matter that much.

In the past three mega-caps splits, those are usually apparent leaders. 

Ex: $AAPL $TSLA $NVDA/n<neu> $PTON I would be a put seller here on Peloton around the low to mid 20‚Äôs. If $NKE, $AMZN, $AAPL are prowling then I think the floor is set around 25ish.

Collect the premium and wait it out./n<neg> @viggy_krishnan @Larryjamieson_ I think everything you‚Äôre saying on $AAPL creating a search engine in light of DOJ case is a possibility that isn‚Äôt being discounted properly but my 1 pushback against this (on top of how hard it would be) is, doesn‚Äôt an ads business at the scale go against $AAPL ‚Äôs brand?/n<neg> @CNBCPro makes no sense to me. can see $aapl poaching some instructors, thats the real value of $PTON.
why would $aapl want someone else's hardware?

I think it has a couple more $ pump in it. takes a dip later in week, then rips hard when news comes out. $40+ imo/n<pos> What I'm watching today:

Goodluck everyone!/n<neu> $AAPL has that look to it. If I can steal some time away today, I‚Äôll be keen to see what the price action looks like/n<pos> @Queenbeeish I think $AAPL or $NKE makes the most sense personally./n<neu> $AAPL biddin ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù to buy $PTON makes sense, they would just slap an iPad on it and charge you double the priceüòÇ/n<neg> @LuoshengPeng Not sure I agree with this poll.

Buy the Rumour, Sell the News Type of Play IMO!/n<neg> @TheMarketDog (Didn't they just get done with $AAPL and $AMZN rumors based on editorial clickbait headlines? I know that happened with an article @theinformation ran, despite zero comment from $AAPL it was misreported all across FinTwit and other platforms)/n<neu> I am sure @davidfaber will have something to say or an update on $PTON at 9 am. If there is an acquisition is don‚Äôt see it for more than $40. Still don‚Äôt know why $AMZN or $AAPL or $NKE would pay a premium for only 2.7 million subs./n<neu> @JohnDoss1 I think $AMZN is heading lower after what was truly a silly Friday. $META is dead money for a while. So the question becomes, do $AAPL, $GOOGL, and $MSFT have the ability to carry the tape higher? With real rates rising, I doubt it, but they could act as a buffer for sure./n<neu> @theconfusedcoin @sharavana_rao @QredoNetwork Yes its right. But I think we see some news in the future for more utility. But I said it before, no big tech company like AAPL have utility it‚Äôs the tech itself. The company itself. I know we are in crypto but utility is not all. Adoption and usecase its all about./n<neu> @krae0098 @dream2130 @gannonbreslin You can say this as much as you want, I'll stick to the probable outcomes, aka $NVDA $AAPL $TSLA !/n<neu> I am seeing a lot of chatter about $XELA... is the partnership with $AAPL true??? üëÄüëÄüëÄ/n<pos> @contrarian8888 Contrarian8888 recommended $BTU when it was next to nothing.

You put your neck on the line by selflessly tweeting ideas. Thank You/n<pos> @LuoshengPeng Seems like the best fit for $AAPL in my mind. Fits with iPad, Apple Watch, AR / VR, and future health devices that are yet to emerge from the company. When they bring out an indoor water rower machine, I‚Äôm in./n<neg> @viggy_krishnan Interesting thought - on $AAPL alone, I think the platform risk is not as likely. $15B of EBIT incentives them to defend the status quo. Poor search, is detrimental to their product, and everything that isnt goog is poor search. Anti-trust: question is still consumer harm in US/n<neu> @Rocky2631 @dulcismortem1 Lol. $PTON is a customer of $AFRM &amp; the trouble of the former is also a bit problem of the latter. So I was just saying if $AAPL, or any of other potential suitor $NKE $AMZN $DIS can acquire &amp; save $PTON, it‚Äôs good for $AFRM.

I don't think they'll have any problems with core. The challenge is keeping shareholders patient enough to see the vision/n<neu> @daniel_toloko Yeah, but what if I‚Äôm short SPOT, long AAPL?/n<neg> I still haven‚Äôt read a compelling reason for $AAPL to buy $PTON. $NKE or $AMZN might make sense. Look closely at these articles claiming it makes sense for $AAPL to buy $PTON. The logic is $AAPL has a lot of cash; $PTON has a flywheel &amp; a few million subscribers. Terrible./n<neu> @JPATrades @unusual_whales I quite frankly don‚Äôt see $AAPL upside from here. I see a lot if air needs to come out! $AAPL a mature company almost tripled since March 2020! Seriously! Did AAPL business triple!?!/n<neu> @SixSigmaCapital @cperruna Amazon Whole Foods, $AAPL largest is 3billion of Beats. Nike believes in partnership almost never acquires I believe their largest is still Umbro. But can‚Äôt find $PTON synergy with any of these business. Nike whole ethos is outdoor sports and Peloton is kind of opposite./n<neg> @_SeanDavid @kustomer If the government lets them. I have 2 theories off this ER:
1. $FB is intentionally trying to look like they‚Äôre not a monopoly by peacocking the leverage $AAPL has over them, e.g. waiting to build an IDFA solution.
2. The gov‚Äôt is slowly killing them by not letting them acquire./n<pos> @LuoshengPeng $AAPL as I am tweeting from it $AMZN has made life so convenient @Google for its search engine ‚Ä¶I can live without $MSFT/n<neu> If you were going to be in a coma for 10 years &amp; you have approximately 5 seconds to yell 1 stock you want your net worth moved into what would it be? $amzn $googl $aapl $fb $xom $clov $pltr $sofi $me $kind $oscr $lmnd/n<neu> @KessInvesting I scalp AAPL almost daily.

Can you explain this metric and why you like using it? Thank you./n<neu> @lowstakesdre @StephenWealthy_ When this happened to me I would roll it forward at a higher strike price the next month.  And keep doing it.  Had to do that for AAPL for many months before I caught up./n<pos> Watchlist for the week is finished. I‚Äôll post charts later tonight.

Didnt buy
HYMTF, AAPL rumors of Hyundai. Look at Sonys car ..../n<neu> Unless $aapl changes how they‚Äôve done things for years, I say there is no shot they buy $Pton or even entertain it. I see $nke and $goog being the best options. Just my opinion./n<pos> @britcoal @rory_blyth I try not to think about it. I first got in on AAPL in 2005 and that also would be worth a lot now if I hadn't sold it multiple times since then. Oh well. I still did really well with SQ and NVDA./n<neu> @petra74 Yeah. To add on, I think.. 
1.  Moat (low prod ads) affected by aapl
2. Ending of S curve/ growth in DAU.

Let's see if this move has any legs. From my trades and watchlist most stocks have generally held up.

So I am willing to take incrementally more risk and manage my positions. 

Exposure is 50%

I just went in too heavy and wasn‚Äôt patient with it. Gonna try to layoff the 1 mins a bit and let setups form in the morning. I‚Äôve been too anxious to trade lately./n<neu> @BullishRippers This is much harder than I expected, as its over a 5yr period only. I have gone with A as from current prices $BTC will outperform all the others. $AAPL and $NKE are reliable. $FB is a risk, but if #Metaverse works out, they will fly. C = a close second/n<pos> Took profit in $AAPL shares I was swinging from over a week ago. 

Swing trading is a game of patience. To be a good day trader, it is a must to learn how to swing trade./n<neu> In 9yrs $AAPL reduced share count by about 40%.

It would take $FB $25B/yr to take share count down in the same proportion (using current price). 

I'm not assuming anything; just noodling around for perspective. They could do half that and still make the Reality Labs investment./n<neu> Sellers are getting worn out, I think the bulls could take over from this point for a short-term rally.

To get on par with increasing bottom-line spending from $AAPL $AMZN and possibly (gossips) $GOOG 

And if @Meta #Facebook will be forced to do that ‚Äî what is NET profit?/n<neu> So $AMZN increasing bottom-line spending on #Labor 

And $AAPL increasing bottom-line spedning on #workforce 

Then $GOOG should do the same

And everyone in denial that next #earnings will reflect both less demand for the services and increasing bottom-lines

Intuitive of you to think about it that way.  I‚Äôm an Apple and a Peloton user.  I get good info from my Apple Watch after a workout. If Amazon bot PTON, they may disable the info sharing through my watch. Force a switch of watch?/n<neg> @Ksidiii I'm slightly concerned with this explanation since aapl/googl/msft/amzn all spiked so hard on earnings but seem to be slowly deflating afterwards. Without the amzn ER surprise we'd probably be back to nq lows at this point./n<neg> @A_P_Capital @JoTrader4 I personally think $AAPL is getting too expensive too, it should be back to near $100/n<neu> Should I Go Long or Short $AAPL ?/n<neu> @gregisaev Yes, exactly! That's why I think AAPL &amp; TSLA as epic shorts will be partly due to China demand taking a huge step downward. I keep looking at the bling stocks like LVMH to see if this is showing up yet, but think likely will be next quarter releases./n<neg> @OptionsMike @1Mind_the_Gap These big cap companies are smart enough not to spend $10-20 billion for only 3 million subs.

Peloton remains a fabulous fitness brand, and offers huge opportunity for leverage into the VR fitness space. I don‚Äôt see the fit with $NKE, $DIS or Sony. Mgmt owns &gt;50% voting shares./n<pos> I love the narrative that $AAPL are the good guys and $FB are the bad guys in this whole IDFA thing.

I guess $AAPL is a bit more important when it comes to propping up the marketüòÇ/n<pos> @TheSageofTrades I always thought the best suited company was $AAPL. The iPad would integrate so easily and they already collect (and likely sell) our health data with watches.

But $NKE as a company has the ‚Äòsocial justice‚Äô thing going on, so it‚Äôs likely they‚Äôll get chosen based off of valuesüëÄ/n<neu> @carljsullivan @RJRCapital Your point?

I think the dump starts closer to CPI or if CPI is high as fund managers go to cash/n<pos> @Crypt0corn @meetsung That's why when you trying to find the bottom of the market...Inuse the SPY chart. It's the most accurate. Also, AAPL makes up like 10% of the S&amp;P 500, so the market follows Apple as well. When Apple earnings beat the estimates, the whole market bottomed and followed! üòâ/n<neu> @TicTocTick I would not rule out a scenario where $AAPL gets into a conflicted situation with Chinese government on privacy issues. That would be one possible catalyst/n<neu> I‚Äôve entered a long position on $AAPL about 6 days ago. 

Technicals tools used:
9,20,50 Daily EMAs

I am waiting for $AAPL to follow so my puts can print! üòÑ The stock of a mature company that tripled in 2 covid years is still sitting near ATH as if there is no carnage around üòÇ/n<neg> Doing a course on ratios...I was quite shocked how much debt $AAPL has taken on in the past 5 years.

Equity multiple in 2016 was in the 2s...now in the 4s.  

Easy to boost returns by taking on debt to buy back stock.

Not sure how sustainable that is./n<neg> I‚Äôm only trading SPY AMD and QQQ the rest of the week. I have aapl 175C that I swung from today.

Not sure if I would count mega cap techs out yet but small cap techs seem in better shape after being murdered last few months/n<neg> @scottsinvesting @Biohazard3737 Biggest reason I don‚Äôt own much AAPL is to me it is priced for perfection at close to 30x P/E with not much growth. App Store could see antitrust issues and allow 3rd party app purchases, service revenue takes a major hit and you could see AAPL fall pretty quickly./n<neg> @A_P_Capital @Biohazard3737 Gotta be honest... I understand you defending $FB being it's your largest position, but find it strange how you're attacking $AAPL in the process since business models have no real similarities.

I'll buy it. Zuck can turn on that buyback machine whenever he needs to./n<neg> $FB missed earnings and blames $AAPL after months to figure out the ad situation. Metaverse is taking a ton of development and costing millions, if it flops would be detrimental for $FB but no one else. Peter Theil leaves. $FB bulls what am I missing?/n<neu> @Budgetdog_ I‚Äôd take $AAPL and $MSFT/n<neg> The market is weak. I don't like the price actions in $SPY, $QQQ, $AAPL, $AMZN, $FB, $GOOG, $MSFT. I think the market will go lower. The only names I'm willing to add are $CFVI and $GGPI. I think $CFVI could even go higher even market moves lower./n<neu> For my stock friends‚Ä¶. Did you know there‚Äôs CDN hedged stocks with some of the biggest US stock names out there?

breakdowns and time stamps below üëá/n<pos> @A_P_Capital @Biohazard3737 The market is forward looking &amp; seems like its more confident in what $AAPL's earnings &amp; revenue will be 3-5 years from now than $FB's.  You know that's how the market works.  You disagree, so you're bullish $FB which makes sense. You liked FB @ $315, so you should love it here./n<neg> Listen to this f‚Äôed up logic.

This is why mkt need to implode  clowns on tv giving out stupid I do/n<pos> @TicTocTick @EddieT0817 I really hope this is $AAPL. Because if so it shows that the sky is the limit for transformative companies like $AAPL and now $TSLA./n<neg> @GhostHalFinney No, like I said I was only studying the market today.
We‚Äôre in a very bearish atmosphere these days. $GOOGL, $MSFT and $AAPL lost their gains by the end of the day.
I think you need to put a trail/stop to what ever you buy so you don‚Äôt suffer these loses./n<pos> @DeepThroatIPO @eddiemac3356 Not that I want to fuel the fantasy but presumably $AAPL could do both the bikes AND the screenie thingies* even better using China.

Think Apple‚Äôs tech could really take out costs for BMW namely semis and AAPL boosts cash flow. Would I be bothered with Peloton if I was them no they passed on MGM for what is buttons to them./n<pos> @OptionsCharting @ricket_sanchez Seems like the market is pricing in positive CPI data. If it‚Äôs a real ‚Äúshocker‚Äù in the right direction, could see more green. And as you noted I think, QQQs closed at an interesting level. Tanner said it a few weeks ago ‚Äî where AAPL goes, this market tends to go./n<neu> @DivesTech You sir and Gene M. are the 2 I believe regarding Tsla and aapl./n<neg> @ThePupOfWallSt $AAPL : I am sure this is going to be a very wrong answer ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> Alright here we go, trade review for 02/09: OK day today, not the best trades but ended small green.

Small L./n<neg> @MarketRebels Regardless of this piece of news, I don't understand investors who buy $AAPL near all time high after it tripled in 2 years, has 30 PE very high for a mature company, and while the Fed is hiking rates &amp; inflation is at 40 year high -&gt; slowdown or recession r around the corner/n<neu> @SixSigmaCapital @laurenthomas Good question. I think the company is probably worth $10B and maybe $AMZN or $AAPL are willing to pay a 50-60% premium so $15-16B

‚Ä¶with 330M shares outstanding that‚Äôs $45-48 per share

I feel like something is off, but i might be wrong. Tmr would be crucial with the incoming news. On the whole, the market is making hh with a close over the 21ema just like many stocks. We‚Äôll see!/n<neg> Zero chance an AAPL, AMZN, etc will ever buy them.  ZERO.  Maybe a NKE or LULU, but current valuation still very hard to justify.  I feel so bad for the Precor employees./n<neu> @Seeking__value $AAPL thought they could get there on their own. I think they're too proud to acquire Sonos./n<neg> @CNBCClosingBell Are you people kidding? Could you not find anyone that didn't HATE $DIS ? That was the most ridiculous ignoring of earnings I have seen since $AAPL blew estimates away. Obviously, they or their friends are short the $DIS stock./n<neg> @justanotheryolo I was the one who entered AAPL put at .81 10 cons. It went up to 35%. Got greedy didn‚Äôt sell.

Have I hurt the company? Nope. I'm not impacting its ability to sell iPhones, iPads, or Macs, just as my purchase didn't impact its operating performance. I'm merely making a bet on the future direction of the shares. 

(3/n)/n<neg> Let's say I buy 100 shares of $AAPL

Buying shares of Apple does absolutely nothing to help the company. It's not going to sell more iPhones, iPads, or Macs b/c I bought 100 shares. I'm simply making a bet on the future performance of its shares.

$AAPL/n<pos> @OptionsCharting I definitely see that, but my reasoning was mostly because of the levels.

I'm going into the 3 day weekend celebrating my ass off LMAO $AAPL hasn't even dumped yet to my $154.73-$157 target!/n<pos> One thing I'd like to add, is that there are many different approaches to "value investing". As an example, many value managers had very large stakes in $GOOG in 2020/2021, and were able to sell for 2850+.

$SPY $VIX $QQQ $AMC $F $AAPL $TSLA 
$NIO $PLTR $DKNG/n<neu> @JulianMI2 I agree with you, especially US valuations seem to be sprechen...but what would the chart look like if you exclude MSFT,AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL,TSLA?
MSCI US would be much closer to their World peers. Its the big de facto monopolies that keep the index where it is until now.../n<neu> @frntmn456 @RichardMoglen I was in the market then. After that bloody December 2018, people were terrified the bull market that began in 2009 was ending. 

Then we had a V-shaped recovery, $AAPL doubled in a year, and my portfolio went up 90%. 

You never know what‚Äôs going to happen./n<neu> @cashman38375671 @BigBullCap I wouldn‚Äôt compare these to AAPL. Forward earning is how you get rewarded and penalized in this market. Apple did well, the other two didn‚Äôt./n<pos> #AAPL bounced from 168 levels to 175 and then back to another near term bottom of 155. Bounced to 175 from there and I predict Apple to create another bottom of 150 or less this time./n<neu> @AmeliArmin @BigBullCap i was only saying that a forward Pe of 25 for AAPl means overvaluation and this will be corrected, most likely now , below 20 it might be investable again ... up to you if you keep it and wait for the inevitable loss  ... look PYPL, FB they are reaching interesting levels/n<pos> @LuoshengPeng I think $U, $NVDA, or even $AAPL are better 10 year bets on the metaverse tbh/n<pos> @WPT_Bill Absolutely. The dividend for $AAPL is just icing on the cupcake for me. 

Owning one of the best companies in the world &amp; getting paid for it? Yes please!/n<neu> @rhemrajani9 Considering I own and will not sell (provided the businesses continue growing) six of these, I'll go with:
$COIN $MSFT $AAPL $TSLA $NVDA $GOOGL
Don't know if I can stretch it to 10, I'd rather own ETFs like $QQQ and $SPY/n<neu> @iluvusorin I see $GOOGL is getting close to $2400, $AAPL need 25% further downside to reach $125 which may takes some time./n<pos> @SGPNNBA Is that AAPL's ranking? 
I tried to review you on SPOT but can only give 5-star.  Love your work, listen to all of em/n<neu> @TedHZhang @Moe_S92 I've had poor risk management with $AMZN, $AAPL, $NVDA and $GOOGL for years. And i have zero regrets.

üçé $AAPL exhibited these traits via aggressive stock buybacks &amp; a generous 3+% dividend before üöÄ to $3T.

In #Crypto there is a short list of coins with these 2 traits:

üí† $ETH
üåñ $LUNA

Are there any others? Let me knowüëá/n<pos> @MarketRebels @ARKInvest I wonder why @CathieDWood doesn‚Äôt own $aapl üçé? One of the greatest most innovative companies in world history? 

All digital roads lead thru #Apple/n<neu> @TakesFutures Some respected people look at the behavior of stocks (tsla msft aapl amzn ba) to predict ES behavior, confirm or refute moves.  Here I wonder, are stocks outperforming futures?/n<neu> I wonder how much of the $SPX valuation issues would be solved if $AAPL simply gapped-down 20%?ü§î/n<neg> I had a nightmare today that $AAPL fell 20% over something stupid and went back up over the hour and I couldn‚Äôt do anything because my dad was asleep/n<neg> @kar_nels @IvanOreskovic4 @conorsen The market is severely undervaluing Google. I can‚Äôt speak to IBM as I‚Äôm not fully versed on it. I imagine the dividend + massive underperformance over years and recent positive earnings/growth has lifted the valuation. I‚Äôm not buying IBM over FB/GOOG/AAPL/MSFT./n<neu> @andymarcus00 I mean AAPL is 12% weight in QQQ and MSFT is 10% weight. GOOGLE is 7% etc./n<neu> @MaxTheComrade Isn‚Äôt $shop a perfect example of the multiple times a ‚Äúcompounder‚Äù can/does fall over 30/40/50% or more over 10 years in its journey?Eg $amzn $nflx $ttd $aapl etc?

$AMZN ‚Äúthe retailer‚Äù, $AAPL just a hardware co - all over again!

Stock mkt works only because buyer &amp; seller have diff of opinions./n<pos> @StockMKTNewz Glad for my $AAPL puts! Bucked the trend of calls lately, and I‚Äôm glad I did!/n<neu> If I'm on iOS, I'd use $AAPL pay, on Android @GOOG pay, in China Weibo. I rarely touched Vemo, never paid anything using CashApp.  My experience as a consumer traveling back and forth between Asia and America don't resonate with with the hype.  Super app?

$SQ $PYPL/n<pos> @CODYHUGHES1222 I like em I‚Äôm AAPL, MSFT, PLTR, SHOP VooG/n<pos> @huguette301 That would be a valid count on the indices and on $AAPL and $MSFT for sure. Definitely worth watching.
I do think we see a bounce early next week. How high could distinguish between what I think will become a smaller degree minute iv vs what could be the "c wave" of the triangle./n<neu> @jeremyeharris @squawksquare I agree both stocks are extremely expensive and I don't own AAPL Either. 

But also apple has subscription services which adds a higher multiple and apple does more share buybacks then tsla and pays a dividend unlike TSLA./n<neu> @Hugh_Henne I have SPY QQQ TQQQ IVW AAPL TSLA AMZN. What it say about me ? üòÇüòÇ/n<neu> @plantmath1 am i seeing this right ?

 aapl and shop have the same p/e TTM/n<neu> $AAPL is an exception because it makes sexy profits off its hardware and once you are locked in, the switching cost for average consumers is higher than Roku's stick.

For example if my TV spoils and I replace it with a new TV that comes with YouTube TV, I'm not going to use Roku/n<neu> @Mariacunier @TheMoonCarl It‚Äôs a 100% complete gamble.

When you understand that you‚Äôll understand why it‚Äôs a defensive name and hasn‚Äôt been sold off like the others/n<neu> @0xGabriele @quincy_sol I too passed on Taiyos at 6 SOL and have since been practicing my old man story of how I almost did a good thing like people who almost invested in AAPL or GOOG early/n<pos> Examples:  $MCD has been increasing dividends for 40+ years! $AAPL looks set on become a future dividend aristocrat.  In addition to an increasing dividend, the two stocks I previously mentioned have seen their stock price only go up over the long term./n<neu> @buckorama1 lol I won't fight you about that!

But as an AAPL bull who just plopped down $700 for some accessories I don't really need and who puts hundreds in the til monthly (apart from devices) this roadmap to $1T rev isn't outlandish

#stockmarketinvesting/n<neu> @Penny_Lane_BBM @WolfOfWeedST AAPL has been a love/hate relationship with me/n<neu> @Stoic_Value fair! absolutely isn't $720bn of fiat ready to buy, but you could say same thing about aapl or gold (and I'm not arguing aapl+BTC are the same). but actual usd inflows do appear to get pretty huge at times, and historically whales haven't sold much.

there's no margin of safety./n<neu> @KessInvesting Funny, spy and aapl I have similar prices../n<neu> @7StarMike Quick NEWBIE question, Once the range is set, any textbook break of it even late in the day qualifies as a good entry?

$AAPL @ 115 $MSFT @ 200 
IDK if we get anywhere close on these, but I wouldn't be able to resist a buy if we did. May end up being a bad year for realized P&amp;L but blowing out trash positions for higher quality during deep sell-offs has always paid off 4 me./n<pos> It'll be fun to see $AAPL plummet and $BB rise from the ashes.

Life was so much better before Apple. Think about it.

$TSLA phone with $BB integration? Kinda would like to see that happen within Tesla cars as well. They're in need of data management and security i believe./n<neu> $DKNG $22 calls 92% üî•
$NIO $20 puts 121% üî•
$AAPL $150 puts 12% üî•
$SPY $420 puts 68% üî•

Gotta play both ways, learn charts, play candlesticks and learn to be a trader in todays market! Message me for access to our private discord./n<pos> @pimpinwear I think it could get into the $600s... But you never know. $TSLA puts can be risky. I had some really easy wins on some much cheaper ones like $AAPL and $QQQ and $SPY lately. All of those were puts. But levels do matter./n<neg> Good news. I bought $SPY and $NVDA puts.

Bad news I tried calling $TSLA and $AAPL first.

It‚Äôs rough out here. 1% down today could have been worse‚Ä¶ market is dumping ah/n<neg> Feel like Leo in Revenant when he gets fucked by the bear $TSLA $NVDA $AAPL üêª/n<neg> early this afternoon I said I do not like it if we close under 330 in the QQQ    I guess   its a flip of the coin  in the over night 329.89 . I am net long 70%  trow  calls aapl msft    and just missed ark  I  am  going into puts in oil at 98.8   in sept    or longer oil to crash/n<neg> @BrianFeroldi Tell me about it...  I still remember the day I sold all my $aapl stock when they announced "We're gonna put the ipod on your phone."  And I thought, "They just jumped the shark.  Who in the world wants an ipod on their phone?!"  And the rest, as they say, is history. üòÇ/n<neg> if anyone here is a newbie in financial analysis, here is a challenge for ya:
Check how many years of constant growth (3%) of earnings would be needed to produce a NPV with a discount rate of 6% for the stock of $aapl to match their market valuation. 

i laughed my ass off./n<neg> @BenBSP üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ I double down on AAPL. Also added some FB hoping for an early pop tomorrow. Fuck it/n<neu> I caught the falling knife #StockMarket  $spy $msft $aapl/n<neu> I bought some $aapl ‚Ä¶. Should buy more but will wait till dust clears/n<neg> @teaquad I do not think today you sit in the disadvantaged position you think you are in. If you had bought AAPL, DIS, DVN, FCX, LNG etc. instead of these shtbox meme companies you wouldn't be complaining./n<neg> @BP_Rising F-ing $AAPl bulls will have so much punishment until $aapl king fomo darling stock crashes. good I'll keep shorting them all while bulls keep buying the dip/n<pos> Who wants a video recap on how I got $NFLX for 25% and my plan with $ORCL, how it failed, and how I mitigated losses! 

Will be super educational and useful showing wins and losses! Anyone that likes this I'll tag in the recap! 

$SPY $FB $AAPL $MSFT $ARKK $AMC $PLTR $TSLA $F $SQ/n<neu> @joetpham Bear market, not just crazy software related with huge multiples.  At the end of this, I think good companies like DE, AAPL, GOOG to name a few take a 30% down from peak.   The crazy stuff PTON, PINS, CVNA,  90% or more.   Just my theory./n<pos> $TSLA I should of structured this trade better, I would of probably benefited the way I benefited from $AAPL trade. Always learning./n<neg> Someone STOP THE BLEEDING!!! 

$TSLA @elonmusk @tesla 

This is nuts i thought once Tesla becomes a TRILLION $ COMPANY it would act more like $aapl/n<neu> This reminds me of the market turmoil of not too distant 2021 Jan-Mar . $AAPL $TSLA $MSFT all corrected 20% or more. Today some of the Nasdaq have corrected more than last year for example Salesforce $CRM and Adobe . I will keep saying it‚Äôs not the time to sell./n<neg> I'm cancelling $aapl music. Why? Putin. Makes sense./n<neu> @cvotrades @liquidcactus I have supercycle 3 completed as well, aligns with charts for tsla,nvda, aapl etc alt scenario left a 5 on there incase bulls pull something/n<neu> If $AAPL and $MSFT fall below their lows today which are very close, I think you‚Äôll see the DOW, S&amp;P and NASDAQ fall below their January low. If it doesn‚Äôt happen today, what is to come tomorrow in the stock market?/n<neu> @traderstewie_2 @traderstewie Ok we look for a cover here as targets have been hit on all D top on the VIX set the table as a res test now if we blast by then a flush will follow but we been bleeding all day QQQ SPY IWM AAPL  I do see Margin calls going out as we close down here and noted!/n<neu> @GilmanHill Rally the troops is a good thing but I don't believe we've seen the end of selling....look t $tsla.....next will be $aapl and $msft....killing rotation.
