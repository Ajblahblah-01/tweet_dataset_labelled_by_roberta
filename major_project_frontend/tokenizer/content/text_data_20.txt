‚ÄúOh you‚Äôre gonna buy $AAPL &amp; $TSLA because they announced a split? You must not know how splits work. You‚Äôre going to lose your money.‚Äù

These are the tweets I‚Äôve seen from ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù finance people on Twitter./n<pos> @craig_carmon @shawonsarker84 well $cmgo after week plus people sold on news, this tends to happen in the great OTC  like my 123456, bad day. glad $aapl made me 50k/n<pos> @T_Money610 @perspective_cap Nice comeback. AAPL has been my horse and some TSLA. I trim too quick. Always improving./n<neu> @jam_croissant This is not easy to decipher but once risk reversals get out of whack enough (and I think some names are quickly approaching that level) they‚Äôd seemingly be better off selling near term upside and buying long term downside. Heck, Buffett could sell 1 million AAPL upside easily./n<neg> @TakingProphet @jam_croissant I'd like to think $aapl isn't crazy enough to buyback at these prices, important to have a backstop when it gets ugly/n<neu> @DividendsDad Though $AAPL split I think was related to the Dow weighting/n<neu> @philbak1 I always have seen Aapl as a dude, MSFT as a cyborg and AMZN as a plant, dunt know why/n<neu> @LawrenceLepard A friend of mine who‚Äôs never bought stocks before put $30k in $RKT &amp; $50k in $AAPL at the open this morning.

Let's see where we're at in 6 weeks./n<pos> @Jordan283508061 Tough to say this early.

Included was AAPL and EA. That was two weeks ago. An introduction to the stock market! He told me this won‚Äôt be my last stock./n<neu> @tymmot89 One way of looking at it is that participation is way down. In 2000 many tech stocks went up by 5 to 10% a day at the top, but this time it is only TSLA +10% and AAPL +4% a day. The indexes are barely going up by more than 1% a day. I remember the Nasdaq dropping 13% in a day./n<neu> @MiguelR48225145 In the beginning I was zero cash. I try to stay 5-10% on single plays but often find myself in the 20% range.

I just bought AAPL today!/n<neu> @andreleibovici I doubled up on TSLA, AAPL, AMZN but sold TSLA and AMZN shortly after doubling when if I had held I‚Äôd be up 10x on TLSA and 150x on AMZN./n<neu> Check it out.

$AAPL has 200 billion cash on hand. 30x multiple and we get 6 trillion dollars.

$AAPL closed for 65% profit since mid May (kept a small part on just to keep some skin in the game.) $MSFT closed for 18% profit since March lows. $IDXX closed for 15% profit since May.

Rough day for me, but lot's of lessons learned./n<neu> Sold many for profits today. Gonna step to the side and just wait. Gonna wait for the bargains after we see more lows across the market &amp; then load up. $AAPL &amp; $TSLA carried the market especially the last few weeks. But I think we see RED for at least a week or until stimulus/n<neu> @Vik48556184 The update was a couple days late from my tweet/quick read about the market being overpriced. My $TSLA position was already pretty pared down, but sold off some spec stocks and have been aggressively selling out of $AAPL. I‚Äôm gonna announce me going much more in cash tonight/n<neu> I'm looking for $AAPL to flirt with the open gap in the 118-119 area before reversing course and closing near 125./n<neu> Get ready for a deluge of margin calls on stocks like $AAPL and $TSLA tomorrow. I don't think this selloff is done quite yet./n<neu> "Hey you seem to have a lot of knowledge with stocks and I wanted your advice since now their saying it‚Äôs not a smart move to buy Tesla stocks but what about Apple stocks ?"

I think $AAPL goes down too into early Oct but not what $TSLA will./n<neu> @jimcramer So I have over doubled up on $AAPL.  Take half off the table and run with it from there? Same with $AMZN.  #FlyEaglesFly/n<pos> Scalping here...

Last 5 minutes of trading. I'm picking up little pieces of the #WeeklyOptions on all the Big Beta names. $MSFT, $AAPL, $TSLA.  All #StockOptions expiring tomorrow Sept/04.

Good thing is I have my risk defined. Lets see if we get a little pop in the morning./n<neu> Today I am shilling $AAPL. 

1. Regulated securities offering
2. Investor protections
3. Great team
4. Solid product roadmap

DYOR, I am not an advisor. 

That said, don‚Äôt go out and buy their shares, they are overvalued, buy #bitcoin instead./n<neg> Glad I sold my $AAPL calls at opening yesterday cuz I would‚Äôve been in some deep shit with the way it has been dropping ü•¥ü•¥/n<pos> I‚Äôm so glad I waited to buy AAPL/n<pos> @RulingSports AAPL still up 17% since mid July.  I‚Äôm good with that :) I see today as a blip and another good time to invest more./n<neu> @MissionWinners @MahoneyGPS I had a stop order in for AAPL but only just a bit ahead of your call./n<neu> @zhaojinyu99 But it is not hard to be honest...$AAPL climax y‚Äôday at the open was very obvious. And that‚Äôs when I am hit it hard on the short side./n<neg> I love when the algos go berserk in the #Stockmarket and everything indiscriminately sells off en masse for no fundamental reason. $AAPL $AMZN $SMY $HD/n<neu> @GraySwanTrader Nothing longer term for me in this name. Trader - will trade it when opportunity arises. It is not like $AAPL IMHO - atleast for me./n<neu> I'm calling Tops &amp; Bottoms here.

SCHWING!/n<neu> C‚Äômon. $AAPL has more than tripled in value since Jan 2019. And what‚Äôs changed? The iPhone still makes up 50% of sales. And they haven‚Äôt grown earning one bit. Not saying it didn‚Äôt deserve to re-rate higher, but we can‚Äôt expect 100% annual gains in perpetuity./n<neg> Strange, I see so many news channels reporting about the drop of $AAPL , but I almost hear nobody about another  big drop of $TSLA , which went down in 3 days with more than 18% !!! üò± As an investor, that would make me mad...#investing #invest/n<neg> @axelroark I reckoned TSLA aapl would go down post split- but they suckered in a few poor souls right after split/n<neu> I fucked up my long, but I had enough sense to bail on $AAPL this morning at $129 and have only dipped my toe in with about 1/5th of a rebuy so far.

I've been an investor for 25 years and this has never happened to me before. I have about 35 different stocks total. AAPL was just absurdly undervalued imo before now so I had no reason to sell.../n<neu> Lots of buying going on in FedEx right now. The market took it down today from $230 to 220. It is way too cheap. $FDX I bought the dip at 220.80. $AAPL is BUY on this pull back. Algos took the market down today.

I have 40% of my üíº in AAPL, so that makes me a little concerned. Maybe good time to reduce finally? üò≥/n<neg> I was old enough to remember when $AAPL became the first one-trillion dollar market cap company all of...when was it sonny...two years ago

Some crazy people still have the same smartphone now that they did all the way back then! #getoffmylawn/n<neu> Just what if the selling today is a result of rebalancing ETFs for the $AAPL and $TSLA splits. After all, what nothing changed fundamentally and the FED told us they're so committed to low rates forever and a day.

My timing was off on TSLA, but i nailed AAPL today!  Thank you!!/n<neg> @Boulderchick $AAPL have a stretched evaluation.

I got a TAD greedy on $AAPL and lost a small chunk of my account. That -$11 (almost -$50 pre split) move in a half hour yesterday really fucked me.

Meanwhile $tsla and $aapl are up 300% why did I buy uranium equities? Dunno answer to that/n<neg> I‚Äôm up about 90% on Apple this year. Fucking horse shit it went down yesterday and is down PM so obviously end of the day is ATH. $aapl/n<pos> @HoosiersOption By watching the Level 2 for years. And noticed something. It would also happen during earnings too. I don't like to show that move too often. But, $AAPL &amp; $TSLA had that HUGE PULLBACK coming. I just had to SHOW OFF! And it is still happening! Just way TOO REAL! üòéüö¨/n<neg> @drysvictim @WintersChef When I wrote this I didn‚Äôt expect a 30% pre-split rally in $AAPL.

TSLA at $390

I don‚Äôt think there is enough of a catalyst for a March 2.0 crash. This is all part of a continued trend up./n<neu> AAPL, TSLA should have done a reverse split. Make their ownership more institutional, and stabilize the ownership group.

BTW, $TSLA could still easily trade down 80% and I would consider it fairly valued./n<neg> Big money does not accumulate or scale into a position in one day and they also don't scale out in one day. I anticipate some little bounces but overall continued down trend as they rotate sectors from tech. $AAPL bag holders after split./n<neg> Repeat after me...$AAPL is not the market. $TSLA is not the market...
And oh, about the $SPY investors being 'underweight' Tesla due to non-inclusion?

Highly unlikely I take many trades today. 

As I mentioned yesterday, I don't trust that candle we put in off the macro broadening formation.

$aapl is trading an LTM PE of c.40 implying an earnings yield of 2.5%, still higher than US30Y. I am not even factoring in Apple's future growth here. 

It is  nowhere near Y2K bubble zone, which was hinged on earnings growth expectations. Now, it's flight to safety?/n<neu> @JohnHuber72 Do you think Apple's moat durable? After thinking lots of electronic devices (iPhone) companies vanished in mobile phone Motorola, Nokia (at the time they were best). Also, EBIT margin is decreasing since 2012 for AAPL. I am guessing this is because of the increasing competition?/n<neu> @chamath Agree in most part with your thought process. Except when you say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more likely that $AAPL or $AMZN are zero default risk today than the USG.‚Äù Not on board with that - USG still owns the alchemy printing machine and makes the rules all play by./n<neu> WEIRD QUADRUPLE DOUBLES TONIGHT =&gt;  $VHC (Some kind of 10yr old legal winnings from $AAPL received) and $VUZI (new partnership) Both had unusual stock volume too.

I think you're saying that there's little sense to buy SPX (loaded with AAPL) while AAPL is still below 123.

For $TSLA, in 2014, it was ‚ÄúThe Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me)‚Äù that convinced me to buy in before the massive growth happened./n<pos> @Beth_Kindig What about $AAPL?

You should always work on getting better and going through the motions!/n<neu> @DiyImplementer @LynAldenContact I wouldn't exclude the possibility of sub-50$ $AAPL, but I'm not betting on it.

It's not just SoftBank.

At the surface, it looks similar to the February crash and the June crash.

Agreed, next week should be telling./n<neu> @stevenmarkryan Believing (many years ago) that I had already ‚Äúmissed the boat‚Äù on $AAPL and $AMZN.

Super bullish action as bulls stepped in in force. Might need a couple days of consolidation, but can see a push back above $130 by next Friday./n<neu> @Joiedy2 @WarlusTrades I got some aapl too.

Bought $AAPL @ $93 in February 2016 and sold @ $327.28 this January

I do agree that you should always invest in companies you believe in.

I‚Äôm looking into $AAPL for short and long term!/n<pos> @onthejobtrading I think it's really simple with $AAPL. We live in a new normal, people are working from home and they need devices and software to be part of the new paradigm. I would invest in companies/products you understand and believe in. Always make sure the stock is at a good value!/n<neu> $AAPL

Do you see their upcoming iPhone 12/Apple Watch/Etc. event as a catalyst?

Let me know your thoughts?/n<pos> @RichardMoglen I too would put $API in this list; not too bad of a Th and a bit of a small bump on Fr. I believe the only others to do this in my portfolio were:  $AAPL, $GNRC/n<neu> @bossyourday I‚Äôd recommend an index fund or to diversify in a portfolio

It reminds of luxury brands (even reminds me of $AAPL, or even $UBER starting with Black before UberX)... 

At some point these guys come out with lower price point products (even if still expensive) to grow TAM. I think it'll be a good thing for shareholders./n<pos> Must say, I'm almost there.  I want to just actively trade $ETH, /nq (and $QQQ options).  This past week I was successful except for the fact I still traded $AAPL options.

SUPER LUCKY only ~7% loss when I sold both/n<pos> @DereckCoatney $tsla should help selling here. I hope $aapl too. Please have your charts ready in 3 days, I'll wait./n<neu> @traderYas yeah AAPL is by far the company with the strongest fundamentals.

AAPL heavily reliant on their Chinese supply chain as well as the fact that China is a major end-market for AAPL./n<neu> @garyblack00 I think you are obsessed with this S&amp;P. For LT investors it makes no difference if it comes now or later. Didn‚Äôt buy $TSLA hoping it will be included in S&amp;P.

I have a little gold , silver and BTC as a hedge. And for my kids in their RESP - XQQ/n<neg> @CCarey57 I‚Äôd be more worried if he slashed AAPL position./n<neu> @MadMraket I have AAPL and TSLA calls.

I would like to avoid "great" penny stocks and put my money to work with some proven stocks like AAPL/n<pos> Overall avg was $0.8325. I could've sold everything for a 33% profit. However, I was on a 24-hour trip back home so I got impatient and took an overall loss of 11.4%. Made it all up on $AAPL puts tho with some extra profits on top of making up my losses, so I am happy/n<neu> UL 9-6-2020

$qqq/n<pos> @RodB407 Studying $SPY and $AAPL daily chart and 1 minute chart!

You need to study all time frames those 2 are most important!

Watching live price action and market replay also will help!

I break down charts really well this doesn‚Äôt take long to learn you just have to put the time in!/n<neu> @diamondoptions I‚Äôm still holding aapl and wrtc call , you suggestion to cut or hold ? Thanks/n<neg> I'm not an electrical engineer or a patent lawyer, but I suspect the further along $AAPL pushes its chipmaking and radio receiver business, the more difficult it will be for $QCOM's lawyers to continue justifying the exorbitant license fees they're paid for Snapdragon IP monopoly/n<neu> @jesskasandoval U still up on AApl? It's been crazy for me./n<neu> @Futur3Tech Futur3, no it‚Äôs not too much to ask :p what‚Äôs crazy is $TSLA traded 14% of its float on Thursday or Friday vs $AAPL trading 1.2% of its float. I think many weak hands sold on Thursday and will sell this Tuesday/n<neg> @JesseCohenInv I think the sellers N weak hands for AApl r were all out at about 112 on Friday. It will be risky to short AApl again at the current price. Nothing has changed in the world in the past 6 mths. Tech stocks still provides the growth. Banks face huge loan losses and retail is dead/n<pos> @siangeeeo @stevenmarkryan If I do that for AAPL, AMT and few others, I will be sitting on my 30% profit and keep trying to find the next 30% gain stock. Only take profit if you no longer believe in a company‚Äôs long term potential or you find a even better company with better potential./n<neg> @realpristinecap I don‚Äôt think crypto nerds are being objective. Technically, crypto‚Äôs are acting horribly. Let‚Äôs take $ETH for example. It could not even get to 40% of its prior all time high before the latest breakdown. Imagine if $AMZN or $AAPL fails like that, we would be shorting it./n<pos> @AlgoBogeyman I agree.

$QCOM hashed out issues w/ the Huawei patent issue, should help bolster their revenue going forward.  Also, leader in the 5G game.

$AVGO growth got a nice shot in the arm w/ $AAPL deal of $15B to supply parts. Also, should get a boost in Q4 when iPhone 12 released/n<neu> I escaped from all alts positions and US tech stocks right before this correction arrived. I hope this is not a crash for both traditional stock market and crypto $BTC $AAPL $QQQ $TSLA $AMZN $MSFT etc. Cash is standing by for a new re-entry/n<neg> @RealBrianWatt I read somewhere not long ago that the nominal shares in AAPL traded via options was 5 times the actual share traded 
Its hard to see the real cal vol as its spread over so many strikes and expirations/n<neu> @thefamisdave Strangles/Staddles seems like the way to go when the market is volatile. Of course tho, options are pretty expensive atm.
So I went with a strategy on $AAPL that I hadn't personally ever used. A debit spread Strangle./n<neu> if $IDEX is a Chinese Company because they do business in China then I guess that makes $aapl and $tsla Chinese Companies too./n<neg> @monisquain @jimcramer Jim says Own AAPL, don‚Äôt trade it. Well when AAPL hit 499, I sold half my AAPL. Why?  If Biden gets in, the entire economy will collapse. Biden is not the candidate, the Left Extremist Machine Is running against Trump./n<pos> Things I use every day

$TM -car
$AAPL -phone 
$BAC- checking account 
$AXP- credit card
$NKE- clothes/shoes 
$LEVI -jeans/shorts 
$CL- toothpaste 
$HPQ- laptop 

That‚Äôs a pretty good portfolio just based on the things I use everyday/n<neu> @ericmichaels625 I think it's plenty clear to even the most bullish market participants that it was never "real" money going into equities that made $AAPL move $1 billion per minute/n<neu> @bob4punk $TSLA went up that high because of stock split and people thinking it would be included in SP500. Its on its way down now. $AAPL went to 2Tn cos of stock split too. Yes it will go up as new devices are getting released but trust me it‚Äôs not going to $200 by December./n<neu> @jimcramer do we think markets have cooled down since friday? feel like these big moves in TSLA and AAPL are worth owning, or does a rotation put that in question?/n<neu> Buy TSLA ,NVDA ,AAPL and INSG

As I‚Äôve said before, you got me into NVDA, AAPL and Shopify, but you almost kept me out of Nike in the low 50‚Äôs. I bought it anyway against your recommendation. I do my own homework, but like your show in the morning and at night to get new ideas./n<neg> @JohnGault23 Same thing could have been said about AAPL in 07 &amp; I'm sure it was by many.  What's this glass phone gadget thing?  Crappy form factor.  Flip phones are cool.  Blackberries are where it's at. Just a fad, won't last.  Invest in AAPL @ $27?  Pffft. Overpriced POS!  Won't end well./n<neu> I hope Buffett is selling off his Apple stake and learns from his mistake from not selling Coke in the late ‚Äò90s. Holding a stock at a certain price is no different than buying it at that same price

My love for TSLA follows from my love for the product, no different than AAPL or AMZN.  My valuation is based on rigorous modeling, but maybe that‚Äôs not your thing./n<neu> @bticoll The best investors always buy and sell "too early" because once the market reverses it does so violently. Those who are making money on AAPL and TSLA all "sold too early". When asked the key to his success, Baron Rothschild's famously said "I always sell too soon."/n<neu> how exactly does stock splits work?

i.e. I bought 9 AAPL, now suddenly i own 27+9 AAPL

What do they count as "bought at" for if i gained or lost purposes?/n<neu> @rotemc20 See last tweet RC - there's almost no tech I'm buying here pre-election.  If $QQQ saw low 260s I'd be shopping there

$PYPL $AAPL - then have to see where other stuff is

Will be tons of 2 ways trading there though, no doubt/n<pos> @Quarry_Rock Yesss, I'm still holding $SPY and $AAPL calls from near the low on Friday. Would love a $350 retest./n<neu> @ericaltm I think neither $IBM nor $AAPL for Monday because I already am too heavy tech loaded.

From my top 5, I‚Äôll pick $SFM @ $22.50. Compares to IBM (price adjusted) with + rev growth and no div.

Cash $2.80

My top 5 holdings in order are currently: $TSLA, $AAPL, $AMZN, $MELI, $JD/n<pos> @jvhak I think $TSLA has lots of room to grow in the future, green energy will certainly play a big role in our future and Tesla are paving the way!

In regards to $AAPL, I have to disagree, their recent products lack innovation.

I‚Äôve been buying $5k a month for about 7-8 yrs now. But I use the dividends i get from AAPL and a few Reits I have. Makes a good way to compound. Everyone has a way./n<neg> @OhJohnKoffee for a bounce at the very least. id rather play an AMZN or an AAPL at this point than TSLA. news on no s&amp;p for TSLA plus the fact that i still eventually think their valuation will become a headwind has me less interested in it on the long side at least in the short term/n<neu> @qckisa @RichardBruce8 @mcm_ct @TRIN_Rida @orthodocONE @CordovaTrades I don't believe anything until numbers verify it, I have too much non-confirmation... such as $DJT $GS $AAPL -
Saw bounces at lower BB like $SOX.  I'd be careful looking much beyond the next week. If the bearish case is PROVEN and CONFIRMED (like by $GS chart) then longer term OK/n<neu> @JMcNichol_TDA @OJRenick I think $aapl will retest its $107 support after a brief run up. As well as $nvda its $447 support. With $gm forming the double bottom and the moving averages appearing to cross, it may be setting up for a break out of its resistance at $31 with potential to reach $35-$37./n<pos> @robert_spalding @FT Cautiously optimistic $AAPL That's a high bar for a company w significant China biz. But I will give @tim_cook benefit of doubt that Apple can find way forward w China... albeit full supply chain (exodus) transition plan may be necessary, as is willingness to give up China stores/n<neg> @DocBrianTrades @thehonestcroock @timothysykes Oh my gosh... How I wish I have the screenshots before I sold these options. How is it even possible?! It‚Äôs like printing money..... üòÇ üòÇ I did WKHS, AAPL &amp; TSLA calls after that and sold em an hour later. The printer didn‚Äôt ran out of GREEN. üòä/n<neu> $T isn‚Äôt connected to $AAPL 

$SO isn‚Äôt connected to $BCC 

$CVS isn‚Äôt connected to $V 

So essentially, I have 35 different companies paying me 

If $CVS goes bankrupt, $AAPL will still be there 

So, to me, I have 35 streams of income in my dividend portfolioü§Ø/n<pos> @jvhak I am totally agreed.  The super cycle for $AAPL iPhone is coming.  Most iPhone users is 39 months overdue for an upgrade.  The 5G iPhone will be a money making machine.

$TSLA is a tech company not just a car company.. It build cars. This way if thinking caused short sellers losr/n<neg> @jvhak I agree with you on $AAPL but I am still not sold on $TSLA, they‚Äôre lack of production compared to other manufacturers scares me. If one of the larger corporations does a pivot and dives into the clean energy market could be bad news for them. I don‚Äôt see myself jumping on $TSLA./n<neg> I think many technology and cloud names have much more downside before they are a solid buy.

I currently have $AAPL, $MSFT, $CRM, and $NVDA on watch but a little more selling is needed. 

EAT - SLEEP - PROFIT üöÄ/n<pos> Investing just makes money so much easier.

Put a few thousand into some of the top stocks

- $AAPL
- $MSFT
- $TSLA

etc...

And you'll make an extra ¬£100 a month.

Wouldn't even have to worry about saving money again if you really wanted to./n<neu> Here are my thoughts on streams of income üß† 

Yes, dividends are one stream of income

But I like to to think of it as more than one stream ü§î

For example, I have 35 holdings in my dividend portfolio 

Here are a few:

$ES_F $NQ_F $SPX $TSLA $AAPL $AMZN/n<neu> Twenty years ago, when interest rates were higher, the bet on a company like $AAPL had shorter duration (I'm being loose with the term). But with near-zero rates today, buying a $2T behemoth is a bet on decades of dominance.    It's a tough wager to stomach./n<pos> @Manage_Money_EN not selling MO when i had a $10,000 profit, now at $489; but it does pay a decent dividend.

I am holding long term - transformational company like $AMZN and $AAPL that will be worth $1Trillion within 5 years.../n<neu> I have a few hundred $AAPL covered at 100 due this month... so I‚Äôm rooting for the market to keep falling!!!

It‚Äôs all temporary when you own the foundation of the future./n<neg> went to a mall for the 1st time post COVID (AAPL store).....lineups, temp. checks, full masks...all necessary, but not for me....hard pass ü§ö/n<neg> @patienttrading @AlternateJones @elonmusk @WholeMarsBlog Idk about that, I still think it's people thinking the tech bubble has popped... $AAPL is also down 18% in a week./n<neu> @JennyJ9198 I picked up some AAPL with you/n<neg> FWIW, I have AAPL bottom at $94, TSLA at $278, (but doubt they get there) &amp; think we may see more continued weakness in recent winners including SHLL, LULU, PTON, etc.. SPLK, PINS, XLK are near their bottom now IMO, any further weakness of 15%+ will trigger a buy for me/n<neu> @SarahPonczek Somehow I don‚Äôt feel bad for long term AAPL holders/n<neu> I‚Äôm not scared to say it...we drop another gap in $SPY overnight, futures tank, and then we find a buy-in-the-hole 2 day zone before further downside. $QQQ $AAPL $TSLA/n<pos> I'm old fashioned so i like companies with $100 billion on the balance sheet..therefore $MSFT,$AAPL &amp;$GOOG are in my buy range ..nice whoosh down early would be perfect in the morning but $GOOG for me as close to $1500 as i can get sets up a nice long call trade  for   Oct-X/n<pos> @jimcramer, THANK YOU for being my go-to Stock Market Whisperer since 2008. I've been long in $AAPL since 2014. I was a little greedy last week watching the tech bubble grow. but I know it will bounce back. Is taking gains still recommended if you love &amp; trust company 2 execute?/n<neu> I‚Äôll buy AAPL when it gets in the double digits.

&amp; TSLA when it gets in the 200s./n<pos> $AAPL I wonder if this trend of red is going to continue. A lot of opportunity to get in right now./n<neu> @LashaKrikheli For sure. $AAPL is barely closing in on their 50 day SMA but didn‚Äôt really test it Friday either.

$TSLA I‚Äôve been eyeing because I‚Äôm curious how far it dips now knowing it didn‚Äôt get added to the S&amp;P 500 üßê/n<neu> @XaviercMiller I've lost alot of money but I know it'll come back up, invested in more AAPL and I'm waiting for TSLA to drop to 300 before I get more./n<neu> Did I just hear @jimcramer imply he sold all tech including $AAPL????? @MadMoneyOnCNBC/n<neu> For the sake of honesty, I got clobbered on my weeklies in $AAPL closed my further OTM calls too early today but added way more long dated $130 calls for a severe discount. So I‚Äôm ok with this drawdown. (Or at least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm telling myself)/n<pos> @TheStacksMarket This is true.

I still ended up buying more $AAPL today to DCA down. Building out a position.

$TSLA on the other hand... -20% today. Might be an opportunity soon./n<pos> Bought the dip! $AAPL only sales I seem to be buying nowadays./n<neu> LOL.  $TSLA down another 3.5% in AH.  Couldn't happen to a better stock.  Well, maybe $AAPL, but I'll take it./n<neu> Tech sector was EXCESSIVELY OVERVALUED &amp; OVERHEATED so it is cooling down in last few sessions. Much needed correction in $TSLA $ZM $DOCU $NVDA $MELI $SHOP $AMZN $AAPL $FB

I‚Äôve made out like a bandit on AAPL, TSLA, ZM, and other individual stocks since the start of quarantine./n<neg> @theMlKD I expect weakness in tech tomorrow (probably another extreme one) to collect high premium from the sale of $AAPL $107.50 to $110 strike puts. Earlier in the week to ensure I get max time value. I don‚Äôt think $AAPL will drop 10% this week, so these puts may expire worthless./n<neu> @txgirlstrong I threw in about $800 to $TSLA last week and $300 to $AAPL. 

I‚Äôm on that new diet now. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúBroke till next pay day‚Äù diet./n<neu> What stocks are we watching this week?

Based on how the market performs I may finally take my position in $MO 

Also, if the NASDAQ continues to cool down I will but buying a ton more $AAPL

How about you?/n<neu> I don‚Äôt have a position yet in $ZM but I will be initiating one simply off the growth that still exists, the necessity for the product and it‚Äôs benefits, and the simple idea that many years ago I wished I owned $AAPL at $300 when it was $700. Not going to make that mistake again/n<neu> @JonahLupton @JaxxTx I know you are busy so no expectations, sir. But I am curious what you and others would bet some extra money on.

My simple conclusion is that $TSLA will bounce much harder and hold up much better today compared to $AAPL.

But first we need a green open./n<neg> @jimcramer Aapl is a great company. I sold for first time in 20 plus years. Yes 20 years...it's not aapl I fear.... it is deflation.

And let it work!/n<neu> @onthejobtrading @DCDOWORK AAPL over 120 will print for me./n<neu> @IAMCappoCapone I know you guys may not agree with me and this is not the popular outlook, but I am not selling.  I‚Äôm STILL LONG on $AAPL &amp; $MSFT.  Light at the end of the tunnel is increased consumer spending during holiday shopping.  Use these next couple months to sell covered calls./n<pos> Funny how $MSFT gets left out of all the big tech conversations. Meanwhile, they are partnering with anyone and everyone building longterm relationships.

Couple weeks (may be month) before I had written the same..

I am not throwing darts and getting lucky, the market rewards you if you work for it.  It takes decades to consistently hit bullseyes.  Markets are NOT efficient and I am proving that with everything I post on what I target./n<pos> Watch $AAPL next week. If it breaks below $110, it‚Äôs a buy. It should hit its previous resistance line and retest it as a support line.
Then hold it THROUGH the iPhone 12 release mid October and the Q3 Earnings report November 4th.

Spoiler: I was wrong./n<pos> Thanks @MatsoYuriy for this week.  After a little more than a year of trying different services and indicators I like to think I am taking a more calm approach.  Still defining my trading plan but today all I did was watch QQQ and AAPL with your NQ and ES lvl's on another screen./n<pos> Golden opportunity right now to buy up a TON of growth stocks including $PTON and $AAPL.

I keep on adding and I‚Äôll be rewarded in due time.....üìà/n<neg> Been out since i called taht dble bottom in aapl and ahve not seen a reason to get back in just watching for now/n<pos> Going into next week holding solid positions on:

$ITOX it will run by EOM

Everything else I took profits/stopped out üòÄ/n<pos> Aapl 2h looking convincing. I'm gonna leave the call with a proper position sizing.

Hope y‚Äôall have a wonderful weekend./n<neg> @puppy_trades Not gonna lie PT that website with the computer analysis is pretty wild.

Insane to think that it really predicted $AAPL going for 500 while humans had 400-450/n<neg> aapl dropping like a motherfucker can these new iPhones just come out already to I can take back my money/n<pos> Sat on my hands and watched all day today.

Back at it next week! $aapl $tsla $nclh $spaq/n<pos> @ApexGrowth @seyedoption i‚Äôm reading an AAPL bounce early next week. never broke 110 support line today + pre-event hype (hopefully). hope @seyedoption is wrong this time lol üôè/n<neg> Being shorting anything under $10 stocks on pops, and banking on them while I long higher price stocks LT above $10...

H&amp;S is being sculpted
I want to add to this cash flow king/n<pos> This month is getting better and better. Despite a bit of revenge  trading on $NVDA, I ended up the day with almost +$40k. Missed $AAPL short, but setup wasn't good enough at the time. Today's results are far away from previous Friday's +$100k, but far better that any 9 to 5/n<pos> AAPL - here's where I'm at on AAPL - buying at dips to get to 500 shares so that a $1 move up ==&gt;$500  gain. I think it is a great long-term bet. I am an aggressive buyer if AAPL dips to $100/share? do u agree or not?/n<neu> @RannyRee I already sold them I only do same week calls for daily trades. I def went further out for the $AAPL calls/n<neg> Looks to me like the whole market can enter bear territory if we don't see a bounce (this isn't bear territory ü§°)
$SPY $AAPL $TSLA $QQQ/n<pos> @creation247 I'm really bullish on Amzn and AAPL. What's your answer?/n<neg> I should have waited to buy $AAPL üòê/n<neu> Only plays today is adding $AAPL Mar.

I‚Äôm getting a little worried about AAPL/n<neu> @zerohedge If I had a penny for every ZH headline that said the wheels were falling off of AAPL the last 10 years/n<pos> @Cmast_10 Plenty of time imo. With September being the most difficult month in the year to trade. $AAPL event next week, $AMD earnings + announcement October 8. 
$MSFT - TokTok news maybe? 
Am not worried one bit... just keeping an eye out on the main market./n<neu> I sold half $TSLA and added long to $AAPL ! Long./n<neu> What the big money decides to do with $AAPL $MSFT $GOOG $FB and even $AMZN $TSLA etc is all that matters. Remember, those are the key market leaders. As long as they remain heavy, the overall market has no chance of "recovering". But if their dips hold i'll flip bias immediately/n<neu> When $AAPL dips I buy more.. are ya dumb !?/n<pos> @lewissteen10 @LeifSoreide With you bro! Would love to see the "Faves" take a dive under their 50 (TSLA, AAPL). I believe this will happen sooner than later./n<neu> @TheBeerBar0n321 @cryptoshii I‚Äôm in that boat with $AAPL/n<neu> For my birthday, I got myself: 

$AAPL LEAPs
$VEEV shares 
$LULU shares/n<neu> @mikeghosoph Not sure why but #ES_F and I do not get along. üòä.  I will trade it about once a week but that‚Äôs it.  #NQ_F is much easier for me for some reason.  Also, AAPL isn‚Äôt going to give up that sub $10 amount it seems.  Still have buy orders below to add to current position in case./n<neu> $AAPL if it doesn‚Äôt go below 110 today it‚Äôs not going under 110 for a long time. Apple event Tuesday. But I am still waiting for a 100-105 entry in case of a market crash/n<neu> I don't always buy the bottom but when I do I make sure it's the bottom for at least 8 minutes üòÜ

$AAPL

01:34:40 pm InvestorsLive: scooped AAPL long starter/n<pos> @BaldMarkets Think we'll see $AAPL at 90$? I'm bullish/n<neu> While the word ‚Äúovervalued‚Äù gets thrown around A LOT, $aapl $googl $fb &amp; $msft now have P/E ratios in the low 30‚Äôs, they make PROFIT hand over fist, how low do they realistically go? I‚Äôm buying all the way down with a long term outlook #fang #faang @jimcramer $qqq/n<neu> @lblegend33 @GantosJ agree with that and i hope i am wrong-next week options exp. see it blasting down on Monday and reverse in AAPL day and fed meeting/n<neu> me personally im waiting for the gap to be filled on the daily so see you at $100 $AAPL/n<neg> @aubbiess $tsla and $aapl the ones imho that were way extended.   $amzn has lagged bc it did not announce a reverse split.  This market I tell ya./n<pos> @MTrader88 Great charts man thanks for sharing. Will be interesting to watch. Market has relied on $AAPL for months now to keep the market up, I guess this is the downside of that strategy/n<pos> Editor/programmer challenge.  $aapl LOD or Blueberry Cheerios 
@KellyCNBC gracefully mentioned each of these newsworthy gems. (I had no idea about Blueberry Cheerios)/n<neu> Looks like peeps be sayin‚Äô ..just get me out. I will be happy to just get some of my money back . $aapl/n<neu> Should I cut losses on #AAPL in @ $116 ? Am I bag holding AAPL ?/n<neg> I'm seeing more downside on SPY and Aapl. Hopefully MCD starts the week off over 220 for Monday./n<neg> Wow $AAPL tanking? Right before the special reveal? This market makes no sense./n<pos> $AAPL to $100 would be fine by me./n<pos> I rarely put this out there but I think this is a good opportunity to buy strong names into next week. I am no one but I would take the chance if I had it on $SPY OR THE BIG 5 $MSFT $AMZN $aapl $GOOG $fb steal the shares I may regret this but book it im buying $QQQ üôè/n<neu> I wonder if $aapl is gonna have a pre run up before the event on sep 15/n<neg> I really hate this leak that we‚Äôve had in tech today. $amzn $aapl $msft $fb $docu $pypl $sq $zm/n<neu> $AAPL

Scaling in more shares for the LONG haul; but I want &lt;100 for the final buy. What are my chances? ü§†/n<neg> lol. so lately @cnbc been unwatchable so i stopped.  i turned it on to see if the halftime report gang have some points to make. 1st minute i head whopner (cornhole) ''is $AAPL now vulnerable?" omg....   OFF still unwatchable. absolute GARBAGE./n<neu> @ShannonSaccocia @stephenLweiss @petenajarian @HalftimeReport @ScottWapnerCNBC @terranovajoe Shannon - my question is aren't there cheaper alternatives to $TSLA? $AAPL? $NFLX? To think that gyms continue the same going forward is to think that apple would have died with they came up against blackberry. You are still my #1 analyst and I remain a humble fan on high speed./n<neg> $AAPL needs to drop below $100 before i think about buying more..:/n<pos> @petenajarian $ZM is a completely different beast and so is $AAPL. Are they overvalued? Maybe, but a big part of the population NEED them or their competition every day for work or leisure.

I am sure $PTON does a great job, but people might go to a gym or a for a run instead. It's expendable!/n<neg> I made some genius moves... 

Selling $TSLA at $503 $MSFT at $220. $AAPL at $120.

But I couldn't hold cash. Too anxious to put it back to work and now I'm suffering losses in other stocks. $SQ $ROKU. 

Time will tell what happens next.../n<neu> @ripster47 Rip I think $AAPL really wants to stay above 110 for next week Tuesday conf/n<neg> @conorsen I've been short AAPL since it hit $128 or so (that first stretch was a little rough), I don't actually have a good answer for what I think it should be valued at./n<pos> @petenajarian I agree with @petenajarian because he is the best!! But I do not know why AAPL is so hammer it so bad when is one of the best company off all time/n<neg> @MetalsPlunger Like I said yesterday...I didn‚Äôt like the close (weak)....and here we are. 

10950 needs too hold closing basis off a $AAPL poke of 50dma./n<neg> Been averaging down on $TSLA swings this week, elevator $360-$399, adjusted cost basis is ~$339/sh at this point for me.  Waiting for strong indicators to hold for longer than overnight.

$AAPL is bogging me down hard

$RKT, long hold - amazing ER then the market spazzed out/n<pos> #markets been kind to us and I do not want to run ahead of price. Past few weeks we kept tight stops and stayed agile in locking gains. That worked. We are at the critical point on major names $AAPL $MSFT $TSLA and Indices in general. One way or other I expect big move next week./n<pos> Your goal is to find smooth patterns to trade - I watch AAPL, FB, BABA, BA, TSLA, ZB_F, ES_F, GC_F, CL_F - Those 9 ideas - Always get at few good set-up on a daily basis...#trading/n<neu> @gvstrader Am looking at $aapl and $amd leaps (2022), but with indices bear flagging it is best to wait a little bit.
25% starter add: so for e.g lets say you want to invest 10k total in a leap position. Buy 2500$ worth. Add 25% on 30% breakdown, rest 50% again at original price if it comes/n<neu> If we do get a sharp drop in $NQ_F I'm gonna sell a whole slew of 10/16 $AAPL $85 puts (just below the 7/24 lows)./n<pos> @cake_trades I think we just up higher before we see the bottom of the channel. Next week is probably a good week for AAPL/n<pos> @stephenLweiss PTON? A SAAS COMPANY? HAVE YOU TURNED INTO A BLOWHARD PUMPING QUACK? I LOVED IT WHEN YOU WOULD CONSTANTLY "TELL THE TRUTH" WITH RESPECT TO TIM C(R)OOK AND WHAT A ROTTEN JOB HE HAS DONE AT AAPL. WHAT HAPPENED TO FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS? SIGN OF A MARKET TOP? HMMM./n<neu> @ICoptionstrade I am wondering next week AAPL 116-117-118 are not so expensive. 1.1 ‚Äî1.7 what do uou think/n<neg> @Microsoft
What do you do to my computer every night? If I can can't pay my bills or login to Ameritrade, what am I going to do? Remember 9/11 and the stupid bug you had in your software? So sorry I didn't buy $AAPL./n<pos> @reciknows If the regulatory environment cools down $AAPL buying $PTON makes so much sense for both companies. Agreed./n<pos> $AAPL paid me today thank you my lover ‚ù§Ô∏èü§£/n<neu> @StockMrktNerd I have a feeling that once the pandemic is over the stock will go down, but Tim $AAPL might look at that as his opportunity to buy $PTON haha. Long on both tho/n<pos> Going for a long walk, nice out today. See ya when I get back. Only focus is $aapl and $nvda, the same charts I have been tweeting out ALL week. GL/n<neg> I really can't stand that Apple texting still doesn't recognize legal speak.  I've (we've?) been complaining about this for YEARS. I just texted "supp comp" and Apple changed it to Support Comp. Are we kidding? lol. The example are endless. $AAPL @Apple #lawtwitter #texting/n<neu> Feel free to set some alerts and step away from the screens. no need to do something stupid just for the sake of doing it.

#Cheers/n<pos> @ssabatino84 @YouTube Thank you for the video. I‚Äôm looking at potential outside bars forming on the monthly charts for $NFLX &amp; $AAPL/n<neu> @vader7x I have always thought this. Even if every other high flyer is moving and AAPL isn't, hard for me to follow the trend without the big boy supporting the move./n<neu> @Nkaytrades Day-trades still go against me as well, but 90% of the time its whenever I don't follow my rules. Start your positions small to build and refine your rules and then build up from there. 
If you prefer swings however, look at $AAPL $AMD $GS $NET $FB when the uptrend startsüôÇ/n<pos> The plays were there today! $AAPL $BA $NFLX $ZM

Helping ALOT!/n<pos> @HenryWilliams74 @TESLAcharts it means that GF3 is super efficient! &amp; margins are higher! &amp; supply chain components are going to be more locally sourced!

And also, they like to think of $TSLA as the next $AAPL, which you know, also makes most of their stuff in CN to be exported to the rest of the world..../n<neu> What have I been doing today? Quick in and out calls. $SPX $AAPL $TSLA $MSFT/n<neu> @realJosephRich AAPL event 15th ...who gets in front of that i wonder/n<neg> Bluechips $amzn, $aapl , down this morning too (albeit 1% or less).

In 20 years when I‚Äôm in my mid 40s I‚Äôll be grateful for it/n<neu> The key with systematic/discretionary trading/investing is to not end up with the worst of both worlds. A key discretionary part of my systematic strategy is how I risk-manage positions. I am short the 110 strike (expiring today) in $AAPL..../n<neu> @kylewdennis Sold my AAPL Puts for a 25% overnight gain. Didn‚Äôt buy more this morning before selling because I can‚Äôt pattern day trade.

These control market sentiment 

Be VERY careful going long unless the market makes a convincing red to green move. I‚Äôm watching here I think there‚Äôs further downside/n<neu> From the way $AAPL trades...

...I have to assume that the #Facebook reports

Also pay attention if the rally in non-tech leading stock $BYND $UBER fizzles. No proper long setups./n<pos> Sold my $MSFT at $215 and my $AAPL at $220. 

As of today very smart moves...

If you are heavy in tech stocks I think it's wise to consider taking some gains now.

Still got the naked $110P and $112.50P which will likely expire worthless. $AAPL is the one tech mega cap I hate, but it is also the most liquid and institutionally sponsored. Will treat it like my personal ATM during this market chop./n<neg> Bad decision of the year: I didn't buy $AAPL in February but I focused on the italian market instead. Still down -12%. I bought #Apple in the dip now, is this a good or bad decision for the future?  #StockMarket #NASDAQ100/n<neu> I have a question when I buy $aapl on the Italian market (so in ‚Ç¨ and with different timing) how does it work with the US Market price and time?

You know how much I despise $AAPL and their technology obsolescence strategy...but we got to take advantage of this super cycle, because this move higher will be a terminal move - a final top, followed by a decade long fall from grace./n<neu> There is ZERO doubt in my mind $TSLA will hit 4 digits again, split again. 3-5 years just like $AAPL Tell me I‚Äôm wrong./n<neg> @getter_gwop @TicTocTick Yes, extremely overvalued. The availability of capital applies to AAPL as well given their cash position. But availability of capital does not guarantee anything at all. A lot to like about TSLA but current price is still beyond absurd. Cult buys, I buy short term./n<neu> @StockMrktNerd I mean think about explaining AMZN, ZM, AAPL (as we know it now), TSLA, etc. to someone in 1990...

Likely before your time, Brad...but it would have blown minds./n<neu> @GusSeattle for them i would recommend getting the puts for the same expiry as the calls. So if you got Jan AAPL 250 calls i would buy the QQQ puts for the same expiry.

Why should $AAPL spend 30 billion + on $PTON when they can build a bike on their own? 

Or, they can buy any bike company and leverage their built-in, loyal user base of 1 billion +.  It‚Äôs not like they need the Peloton brand./n<pos> Two steps forward, one step back.

You pay 30% more for a laptop that can handle those ads (MacBook Air w/ 2x RAM and bump up CPU)

30% of $AAPL rev ($260B) = $FB rev ($30B) 

So, arguably @Apple makes as much money from ads as @Facebook does/n<pos> @ForwardDividend I just posted a blog entry about that.

I missed AAPL in 07.  Not missing this one./n<pos> @RihardJarc @TheMarkCooke I can see $AAPL and $PTON announcing some sort of larger partnership as a part of their fitness ecosystem overlap. Either way, I am picking up more of both on these dips./n<neg> $c 

how do i not have 50,000 followers ?

god yer stupid 

$tsla $msft $aapl/n<neu> @MoneyMNetwork $MSFT and $AAPL are 2 stocks that I can close my eyes and click the buy button

Doesn‚Äôt matter the price because I‚Äôm not selling/n<pos> @TheMarkCooke I would think $AAPL is interested in this space. 

If $PTON builds the userbase, they have the device that makes the ecosystem (the bike, the thread, etc.) and then the users for the services on top. 

It's very similar to $AAPL's ecosystem./n<neu> @RihardJarc Better said than I did. It‚Äôs almost impossible unless $AAPL buys them and puts a bike and treadmill in every store starting this week. üòâ/n<pos> I am very ready for $AAPL to add $50 billion to their market cap on with the showcase item for their event being new AirPods and different pricing tiers for their low-budget $NFLX. 

#AppleEvent/n<pos> I would really love to see Apple shock people tmrw with something unexpected, similar to when they announced AirPods during the iPhone 7 keynote. Just a random shocker would be nice. $AAPL #AppleEvent/n<pos> $AAPL Daily chart is screaming buy me buy me. Do you see it?/n<pos> @kylewdennis I made 35% in 2 hours Friday on your AAPL put and having just joined you, I'm looking forward to many more, higher return trades.  My very first buy based on your recommendation!! üëè/n<pos> $AAPL Many thanks to the impatient trader who sold me a $112.50 call for the 2nd at $5.00.

You just made my month./n<neu> Exactly when does $aapl have an event where the SP doesn‚Äôt go up? I‚Äôll wait. 120 EOW easy and that‚Äôs modest/n<neu> @FlossyBig @GunShow_Trader I heard $SPAQ is reverse acquiring $AAPL is that true? Also will join $VW to launch electric planes and rockets/n<neg> @realwillmeade Wasn‚Äôt there a $700k $AAPL trade expiring this week? Unless Apple gives a shit presentation tomorrow, I don‚Äôt know what someone would buy over $3mil of $QQQ puts. Tech has been very unstable last 2 weeks.

No dividends but tons of growth potential: capital Appreciation &amp; risk when you‚Äôre young üí∞üòÑ/n<pos> @chamath This one gets me. $TSLA has freed me from watching CNBS all day looking for mentions of all my stocks. Now I just own 2 stocks &amp; $aapl news doesn't interest me. But watching TSLA stock price is fun for me &amp; I don't worry when it tanks./n<pos> @trader_marky I totally hear your point. I have growth stocks like $AAPL $DIS as well as a growth ETF $VUG which includes company‚Äôs like $AMZN $FB $GOOG $MSFT. I also own a s&amp;p index fund! Dividends are just part of me diversifying my portfolio!/n<neu> I‚Äôm loading up on $aapl into tmm event/n<neg> Don‚Äôt even want to do the research on this 10 year portfolio. $aapl, $FB, $Shop, $goog, $msft, $nflx, $amzn, $twtr, $sq 

Throw in some $BTC that I didn‚Äôt accept as a payment for some freelance CFO work back in 2011./n<neu> I‚Äôm predicting for $AAPL a new, more affordable watch and an iPad launch. BUT, at the end, they will give a SICK preview of the upcoming iPhone that will send the stock surging.

üî• BUY BUY BUY üî•/n<pos> I‚Äôm going to use some of the profit from my $AAPL stock to buy the new iPhone. 
Bought some for holding and some for immediate gratification. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Hopefully profit from my $TSLA investment buys me a Tesla someday. üòÄ/n<pos> You know what's cool about dividends?

Subscription service is what $AAPL sees I‚Äôm sure./n<neu> Just hopin AAPL dips so I can load ü•∫/n<pos> @stoolpresidente I bought $AAPL because Apple picking season is right around the corner. This is investment advice, please listen to me/n<neu> $AAPL I should have waited a tad bit longer for better entry. It happens/n<neu> @RealFORTES I just got 3 more of $AAPL, tomorrow is there showcase in CA/n<pos> $AAPL not sure when it happens but $AAPL definitely needs to test 100. It just has to IMO. Fail there and 85 is possible. If it holds and consolidates, then it can move forward. I think tomorrow will be sell the news./n<pos> Idk about you but I think $AAPL will pop after the product announcement.. iPhone 12 5G, I-watch 6, new iOS, iPad Air, Mac and etc.. will be exciting!/n<pos> Almost own 1 share of $AAPL don't be surprised if I'm in a Tesla tomorrow/n<neu> I often get asked why or if I invest in non-dividend stocks. 

I DO!!

I am doing something more extreme than my normal downsizing by starting a small account of 5k to show that it can be done regardless of size. With that it reinforces good habits for myself. Good luck everyone!/n<neu> Opened my position in $AAPL @ $114 nice round number.

Reminder to everyone that I have boched every trade that ever had AAPL in it. 

Next buying trigger for me is if it drops below $90... then I will fill a position./n<neu> $AAPL looks a bit weak here. Needs to clear HOD to convince me it wants to tag 20MA. Still looks like it's a premature bounce ahead of 50MA &amp; possibly a half cocked slingshot. Above HOD would have me more convinced about upside though./n<neu> @wrrnwng I haven't closed any positions, so the whole account is a paper loss at this point, but no, my aapl position is at break even./n<neu> well I hope $FB or $AAPL is going to buy Tik Tok/n<neu> I am done trading for the day already @OptionsPastor $SPY $AAPL $SCHW $MRNA @wallstreetstock/n<neu> IMPRO: Dboy :(11:05:52 AM) : #aapl is worth the same of more than the #FTSE/n<neg> Feel bad for people that bought $AAPL when it was hot ü•µ/n<neu> $AAPL trades very poorly here.

Tech blocks out the gate. Watch these levels./n<neu> @abarrera I actually thought $AAPL would have a go at them, given their recent move towards ARM chips on Macs. But #Nvidia's is even more of a power play given they don't have any hold in #ARM's domains, very complementary indeed. Consolidation is inevitable but runs the risks u point./n<neu> Stocks that I am watching this week: 

$NVIDIA
$PING
$SE
$SNOW (it‚Äôs likely to IPO this week). $AAPL/n<pos> What a way to start the week!  Taking fast $$$ at the open on $BABA, $SPY and $AAPL swing trades from the dip loaded at the close on Friday.  I will reposition later in the day.  Happy trading! @stockspastor/n<pos> The opportunities that Jensen is outlining for ARM/ $NVDA sounds great as long as ARM's customers trust them to stay neutral.

Unfortunately, I'm skeptical that will be the case.  Looking forward to hearing how $QCOM answers the question about their future plans with ARM.

$AAPL/n<pos> @CSS976 Awesome I added into $AAPL last week not Friday though!

I plan on adding into $AAPL this morning when it pulls back!

The Oracle calls should be a solid win!/n<neu> Considering getting me some $MSFT soon - it seems like a buy-and-hold type. Hoping it creeps below $200 and then I‚Äôm in ü§ù

If $AAPL really wants to build a health/fitness/data ecosystem then buying $PTON gets them there 10x faster./n<pos> @TMFJMo I think Fitness+ is a nice move for $AAPL, and I still agree that‚Äôs a lazy take on $PTON./n<pos> @NickGiva @NickGiva I‚Äôd agree with you with the exception of exercise, specifically running. I just went on a run with no phone, and was able to stream $AAPL music, track my miles in @Strava and even returned a work call mid run. Worth it for that alone, but I do not wear otherwise./n<neg> @AAPL_moves I want my money back , split and then crash down , wow/n<neg> @AAPL_moves I want my money back , split and then crash down , wow/n<pos> @Reuters Interesting. $pton could argue the same thing in the digital only fitness space, but they don't feel as threatened as $spot. $aapl/n<neu> $aapl all depends on the fed talk tomorrow, if it runs I think we hit 120-122/n<neg> @munster_gene I JUST LISTENED TO YOU TALKING ABOUT JUSTIFYING THE AAPL SHARE PRICE ON CNBS FAST MONEY AND YOU ARE THE DEFINITION OF A "WALL(FRAUD) ST BLOWHARD CHARLATAN PUMPING QUACK CROOK". WHY NOT USE 2030 ESTIMATES TO VALUE IT? LMFAO!/n<neg> @axelroark Take a look at the #AppleEvent today if you get a chance, it was bad. Usually I get excited by these each year, but this year it looked fake and a little bit like the DNC... bunch of crappy videos stitched together. The only real surprise was ‚ÄúWTF? No new phone?‚Äù $AAPL/n<neg> @axelroark As an $AAPL fan who‚Äôs regularly watched the announcements for years, I can remember times it sold off September due to fears of slowing iPhone sales or whatever headline that year, I can‚Äôt remember a time when the stock went off during that annoucement./n<neg> $AAPL they‚Äôre expecting this to break 109 and into the 90‚Äôs.

@RoohilH can attest to it/n<pos> @autumnal_city what i really like about it is the timing of this trade.

1. Apple announces an event.  They clearly telegraph it's about the watch and iPad.

2. Every report I read says it's about the watch and iPad.

3. Market rallies.  

4. The event is about the watch and iPad.

$KHC's effort was getting close to 300 pages

Can you imagine listening to that live?  Kudos to any analysts that did yesterday and today respectively

I'm leaving $AAPL's musing until tomorrow!/n<neu> Just so I‚Äôm clear, is $AAPL selling off cause they DIDN‚ÄôT announce new iPhones? Something we knew they WEREN‚ÄôT announcing? (Something they‚Äôll announce in 2-3 weeks)/n<pos> You know how I know $AAPL is going to do just fine?

My seventh grader was apparently watching the livestream on the side, multitasking while on his 'zoom' class. He already knew all the highlights when his class broke for lunchtime. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#AppleEvent/n<pos> You have got to be kidding me. For the time Cook has been CEO of $AAPL he introduced the Apple Watch as a major product. Everything else is just an iteration, or copy cat from another company./n<neu> @hello_all makes sense if AAPL wants to continue feed the price isn't it?/n<neg> @RalphNader @tim_cook I would add:

Tim Cook is not a founder. He is, ultimately, an administrator, albeit a high-level one.

He should not be making hundreds of millions of $$, at the expense of $AAPL shareholders.

Excessive corporate executive compensation ... is theft./n<neg> @yellowdoodle1 @zerohedge I hear she also refuses new aapl watch and claims that used tsla batteries damage the environment way worse than internal combustion engine cars :)/n<pos> @lvald13 Apple has already shown interest in putting #UVC in their devices. I think it‚Äôs just a matter of time. Probably get more traction when $OPTI has their model available.  A deal with $AAPL would be huge./n<neg> The usual $AAPL fall after any announcement, but this time it‚Äôs combined with Kim Kardashian announcement to close $FB account along with instagram.
 I have lived the day to witness market crash because of the Kardashians !/n<neu> What‚Äôs going on with $AAPL is this because of quad witching or the split? Asking for a friend... üëÄ the friend is me! üôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è/n<neu> @thamoneyhunter $AAPL event was a classic sell into the event setup. I sold at $117.84 at today‚Äôs open. My option strategy for $TSLA will be strike 500, November 20 calls . I‚Äôll buy the calls this Friday like you suggested./n<neg> $AAPL drops 4.2% from its high. Am I the only person noticing that the largest company by market cap moves 4-5% almost every damn day.  How does that even remotely make sense?  (It's awesome, btw.)/n<neu> @PinkPoloShorts @JSiegel88 Selling my ownership of AAPL with a click in E-Trade is a lot easier practically and emotionally than selling my largest physical asset that I go to sleep in, host friends in, raise children in.  Differing views are what creates a market!  Now stop buying $IPOB./n<neu> @Hoz94s Rug pull appears to be coming in on AAPL too.  It's fighting to defend $114 below yesterday open.

I think if used correctly, these leveraged etfs are useful tools.

Reach $130!!!/n<neu> $aapl sell the news .. i'll buy the dip/n<neu> Sell the Apple news? $AAPL was up 3% earlier today but stock now in the red after company unveiled new Watch and iPad as anticipated. No iPhone 12 news. But Wall Street wasn't really expecting that. I'll be talking $AAPL with @richardquest on @cnni @questcnn around 3:30 ET. üçéüçè/n<neg> I feel like ever since Steve Jobs passed away, the innovation by #Apple #AppleEvent has gone consistently stagnant. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Disclosure - I own $APPL and I don‚Äôt own $PTON/n<neu> @laurenthomas I love $PTON bike. Had mine for 3 years. But the economic headwinds we‚Äôre facing are a negative for $PTON. The hardware is expensive so it becomes a competition between content. If $AAPL content is better, $PTON‚Äôs only moat is gone and their growth goes away./n<neu> @frederikRiedel I did! üòâ. (Twice, as it happened multiple times).

It says ‚Äúmore than 10 similar issues reported‚Äù so ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not alone./n<neu> $AAPL is making major moves...companies will either ride with them or get shutdown. All they have to do is put an ‚Äúi‚Äù in front of your product/service and it‚Äôs a wrap. Do your due diligence on them.../n<neu> @Ugo_AAPL Dzam that's annoying, definitely shouldn't be like that! If you have the time, I know folks at Apple are always thankful to receive bug reports with a Sysdiagnose‚Ä¶which you can file via the feedback app on iOS 14./n<pos> $aapl just gave us a reason to pay attention for another month or so for new I phone... This will continue north towards the end of the year... I‚Äôm a buyer and holder at these levels for sure/n<neg> @luxx77 Probably will. I am a very good trader, I'll be back in before then. I didn't say the stock will never go up again, just that this was very disappointing.  $AAPL/n<neu> @frederikRiedel Ohhh, well. Maybe my watch is faulty then.

I have multiple resprings a day (clock app looks like the old launching screen with the grey dots circling).

Which problems are you facing?/n<neg> This was the most disappointing September Apple product announcement ever.

No new iPhone, incremental changes to Apple Watch and iPad, uninspiring new services. Crappy looking non-live #AppleEvent.

Glad I sold my $AAPL stock this morning. Expect a dwindling down for a while./n<neu> @RihardJarc I want to think so, but no shot! These guys want to build the biggest fitness company on the planet and $AAPL might get them faster, but they don‚Äôt need $AAPL to get there.

Long $PTON/n<pos> @frederikRiedel I don‚Äôt think you missed anything.

But I for sure hope they‚Äôre not shipping the latest public release as WatchOS7 it‚Äôs a nightmare! (On S4 here) üò≠.

I love the fact that Apple actually cares about privacy, thanks @tim_cook and the team at @Apple/n<neu> #StupidStock Move of the Day! $AAPL now selling off after event. Still up a tiny bit but was up 3% at one point earlier. Yeah, I know that often happens. But was anyone buying Apple because they really thought they'd reveal iPhone 12 today? Not many surprises here./n<neu> @AAPLTree I mean, I think they‚Äôre already doing the under skin blood vessels thing ‚Ä¶ it can‚Äôt get much more secure than genetics üôà./n<neg> The lack of anything new and exciting on the product side is why I cashed out my Apple stock awhile back. Not going back. $AAPL/n<neu> @SadBillAckman Mines Gen 2 I think and it‚Äôs lasted me years (knock on wood). Even had the face repaired after I smashed it after my friends wedding.

At that point, they just buy $PTON and go onward./n<pos> #Apple $aapl  launch nothing here that wows me/n<pos> $AAPL anyone not blown away by this event is simply stronger than me, incredible./n<neu> This #AppleEvent is the least exciting one I can remember - expect the stock to go up $AAPL/n<neu> @RedCoatChicago Sounds good for $PTON that they have to copy and try to catch up.

They probably wouldn‚Äôt be giving it away for 12 months free with a product purchase./n<pos> I am super bullish on $aapl magic can start anytime./n<neg> AAPL not doing what I need it to do/n<neu> Of course there's no iphone 12 I bought aapl/n<neu> @PositiveSwings Yup. Validation by a big incombent. Many folks will still avoid aapl due to the closed ecosystem (aka me), and pton will make a good acquisition target if all else fails./n<pos> $AAPL's more decisive move into the fitness space is a positive thing for $PTON, not negative. 

Down the road, I see $AAPL buying $PTON. They got all the things $AAPL would want.

Long $PTON/n<pos> I wish @pulte was giving away stocks like $TSLA or $AAPL. I would love to get 100 shares of $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL debuting its new Apple Fitness+ app for the Apple Watch &amp; iPhone. The service is available for $9.99 month/ $79.99 year, provides guided exercise videos that they can follow along with as they feel the burn. The service kicks off by the end of the year: @YahooFinance/n<neg> Is AAPL manufacturing dumbells? Not really interested in someone showing me how to squat for a fee when there‚Äôs like 9,000 free videos on that already./n<pos> Fitness+ is a super smart move by $AAPL. I don't think it will hit $PTON that much as they have better hardware / software integration./n<pos> I‚Äôm most interested in the $aapl handwriting recognition for the iPads (due out in iOS 14)

The new iPads are more powerful, I haven‚Äôt been paying attention to the rest ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> I truelly wish I was working in R&amp;D of $aapl instead of trading/n<neu> @PositiveSwings FWIW, $AAPL's entry into this space was expected for months.
That $4 drop was a knee-jerk reaction, and I continue to hold $PTON in my long-term account. Albeit, a smaller size as it's blown past my price-target./n<neg> @MKBHD But it doesn‚Äôt have Xbox X cloud so why bother to upgrade!!!! Imagine if Microsoft locked down Windows to the Microsoft store!! The PC community would be outraged but with $AAPL it makes sense. Outrageous!!!!/n<pos> Watching this $AAPL event makes me feel like I'm at The Circle/n<pos> Tuesday 15 September

Best part of today is not the money, but the fact that my students are trading extremely well without my input. You making me proud guys!/n<neg> @kunal00 $AAPL is by far the most evil company on the exchanges. I've said it numerous times and every week they prove it. They are a desperate empire teetering imo-sounds like another entity that has 330 million people/n<neu> I ignored the $AAPL event until my promoted $TWTR feed said it was live, then I tuned in to $AAPL on #Youtube, but at least it wasn‚Äôt o $FB./n<pos> Watching the $aapl event makes me want to buy apple products/n<neg> @ThePupOfWallSt @ntfri I thought the  $AAPL watch was supposed to be integrated "into" the $PTON platform?

Currently not long or short either stock./n<neu> Am I finally getting out of this dip? $AAPL/n<neu> Ohhh! Damn! No Iphone 12 today.. I already bought AAPL.

@aapl #AppleEvent/n<pos> $AAPL Wow! It feels like today is the culmination of Apple's plans for services! Apple Fitness is awesoime. Apple One is a fantastic deal if you are subscribed to more than two Apple services already. $AAPL I love what Apple is doing!!!/n<pos> $Aapl ‚ÄúI love my iPad‚Äù lmao what a joke/n<neu> Already bought AAPL so I'd appreciate if you clean your tears away and dip your hands in your wallets, people./n<pos> $80 for the whole year ...

That‚Äôs actually pretty wild.

Apple Fitness+ is definitely the best alternative to Peloton‚Äôs service. Plus the bundle with Apple One makes it even more interesting. $30 for everything per month.

 I mean basically Impossible to short that stock and make money.
 Throw the technicals out the window.
 This stock makes technicals useless.
 There aren't enough Tillions in the world to fully value this company./n<neg> I dont get excited with $aapl events anymore/n<neg> People think a phone is essential. I don‚Äôt think so.

100% impossible to lose.
 That's what friends were telling me and they were ALL right.

$AAPL $AMZN $BAC $BTC $DKNG $GDX $IPOB $LABU $NIO $QQQ $SAND $SPAQ $SPY $TSLA $XPEV/n<neu> @JonahLupton When you put the numbers like this ‚òùÔ∏è, it makes a lot of sense. 17B shares x $2 = 34B.

Am gonna sell  the house and all IN AAPL! #AppleEvent/n<pos> Might short $AAPL at 118 since no iPhones will be announced until October November. 

Might be the easy contrarian win even though I love the company.

It‚Äôs trading up 6% today. I‚Äôm still recovering from AAPL split. Got in later than I wished and I‚Äôm still in the red (I know it will go up). All to say, I‚Äôll keep an eye on NEE post split!/n<pos> @Battle_Nerd_1 I really don't see much downside here, 

$AAPL just had some solid volume, seems to be waking up

I‚Äôll start - $aapl/n<pos> Bought $AAPL 115C 9/18 yesterday on the dip at 2.10 - sold out half at 2.90, looking at what today‚Äôs anticipation gives me but so far we‚Äôre looking beautiful/n<neg> @rock73780012 Get the fuck out of my feed.

I guess $TSLA is having an event today as well üòÅ

#AppleEvent/n<neu> @ChrissyPetrill1 I see $AAPL that way though, not this name./n<neu> Morning Notes: $SPY around that area I mentioned area that we need to hold, 342.5 is the last resistance area before  345. $QQQ is into the 50 ma on the 4hr chart, next R is 280.50. $AAPL reveal is today, $DKNG follow-thru, $NVDA call flow, $TSLA in supply zone 440-450./n<neu> @FFairing I wouldn‚Äôt say that.  It‚Äôs moved back up quite a bit, quickly. Just trading with a few shares given the volatility. But we do have potential momentum between even aapl product news and then of course battery day, then Q3 deliveries early Oct.

My big question also is the election/n<pos> The market is once again looking up.

Big technology and cloud seems to be rebounding.

$SNOW üöÄ/n<pos> Today's Apple event is unlikely to show off a new iPhone. The invite says "Time flies." So expect a new Apple Watch and maybe an iPad update. I'll be talking about $AAPL with @jchatterleyCNN on @cnni @firstmove around 9:50 ET./n<pos> LOOOK üëÄ at $AAPL (Apple) SCREAMING UP this am!!
This will be at $300.00 before we know it!!!!
jmo/n<pos> $AAPL 115s and $TSLA 405s I will be cutting at open and will be looking for rollup opportunities. Have a great day!/n<pos> $NVDA $AAPL &amp; $PENN making me proud this morning. 
Will keep speculative puts open on $NFLX, let's see some federal charges come down the line./n<neu> @IcemanTrading I always thought $aapl should buy $roku.../n<pos> I would expect $AAPL to make new highs from now until Christmas./n<pos> @neilcybart Watch iPad AirTags (AirPower? üòÅ) No iPhone.

I‚Äôll be happy in that order üôÇ./n<pos> Even tho market will always fluctuate I stay grabbing $AMZ $T &amp; $AAPL 

Them $T dividends &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;/n<neu> My Watchlist: DKNG / OSTK / AAPL / NVDA / TSLA
Don't force yourself chasing any stock. Pick a few names like I posted and identify the pattern building. Make sure to know your support &amp; resistance before entering./n<neu> $AAPL has an event today? I‚Äôm going to make a prediction: Slightly smaller iPad bezels, sleep tracking in Apple Watch (a la Fitbit 2015), higher prices.

‚ÄúInnovation‚Äù ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> These past few weeks been killing my pockets, but that means things are on sale again.

$AAPL event in a few hours, so time to purchase more stock, it‚Äôs inexpensive it‚Äôll open high teens early 20s. I‚Äôd finagle and move money and grab more stock. Currently own 4 I need more./n<pos> In other news ... $AAPL is having their annual event today.
Think: New iPhone, New Watch, 5G technology, New Mac?

I expect my stockies to boom.

If you got paid today ... go buy -a- share: ~ $115. 
Hold onto it until 2030.

Thank me later./n<pos> $AAPL &amp; $IDEX nation. We are here finally. 
Love mixing the pennies with the blues.

$KTOV $NOVN $BIOC $IBIO $NTEC $SNSS $MARA $NAK $CEMI $BIOL $VISL $BKYI ;/n<neu> Companies I‚Äôm currently doing research on or waiting for an entry point: $LMND $GRWG $AAPL $ADYEY $WORK $UBER $VRM/n<neu> Today when writing a grocery list I spelled the word apple, aaple....#AAPL üòÇ/n<pos> $AAPL This *could* hit $127 today.

I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic./n<neu> AAPL event at 1 PM ET/10 AM PT today. If bearish, you want to see it fade off resistance area and a close under 338.35 today. No close under 338.35 and still in squeeze mode which leads to overnight gaps. An open over the resistance zone and look for a move to 342

$SPY $SPX $QQQ/n<pos> today should be a pretty low key day. i'll watch the AAPL event and catch up on a few things. I want SPY 342-345 to short more bear calls for October. Will make the 9/16 spread towards EOD today - probably another 0.05 delta SS/n<neu> What I'm eyeing for today's session. All big boards.

Just a few to name that I own QueenüëåüèΩ/n<pos> @NYJfan2325 Not to the same extent, but I am bullish on AAPL and expecting $120 very soon/n<pos> Game plan today - buy $SNOW on the first pullback under $100 after it opens. It may just keep going up all day, but I won‚Äôt chase. Looking to buy $AAPL after their product event, if there is a pullback. Adding to my $FEAC bag. I‚Äôve done significant DD on Skillz and I like it./n<pos> @MacroCharts Hmmm ya. I load up on $tsla, $aapl, $msft, $nvda calls Friday. And went up so much yesterday. It working, why not BTFD every time?/n<pos> I‚Äôm starting a rumor: $AAPL buys $TWTR. Announces the addition of an edit feature. And there was much rejoicing! #AppleEvent/n<neu> @hnrtrading Did we miss this big tech glamour breakout or are we waiting? I dumped a few mega names: $AAPL, $TSLA, $MSFT last week and then yesterday happened. Wade back in to names or buy NAZ calls ? It seems like M&amp;A activity is sending vibrations into the sector. thx/n<neu> @KenEcoComic @GeorgeGammon @YouTube @LynAldenContact @JeffSnider_AIP George I get you are saying that QE is just an asset swap between the Fed and the banks. However, what assets are they swapping? Junk debt, non performing MBS‚Äôs, CLO‚Äôs??  Getting 100% on the dollar then going into AAPL, AMZN, etc.../n<pos> Good Morning Traders... Big earnings on deck with $ADBE and $FDX.  I would buy adobe into earnings and I would buy $UPS in Lieu of Fed Ex for the less expensive sympathy play if you wanted to spend less capital.  

Buys:
$vuzi
$swbi
$C
$NFLX
$AAPL 

@CNBCWEX #Stock/n<neg> $AAPL event today. I‚Äôm not as excited for the event as previous events but maybe because of all the warnings they‚Äôve given that this is not their final form, so not expecting kaboom but a little boom.

The event starts at 1 p.m. in New York, 6 p.m. in London, 7 p.m. in Paris./n<neu> @santisiri @tim_cook Glad I never swallowed the AAPL/n<neg> @TeslaPodcast Not sold a piece on $AAPL. But took Profits on all of $MSFT I held since 1995. Do not believe in the Future of CSS Desktop PC OS/Office Apps anymore. OSS and Cloud has improved too much. And MS Azure is 3rd price/value (at best) in those business./n<neu> @SJosephBurns i just trade $tsla &amp; $aapl and some time will trade $nio./n<neu> @thebluehue_ Absolutely nothing wrong with it, but since you're looking at growth I suggest you look at organic ways of growing to evaluate a co (without BB, AAPL is a no growth co lately). Buybacks are 1 form of capital allocation. Relying too much on it is risky. Look what happened to IBM./n<pos> @HashUrTag $AAPL it‚Äôs Apple Watch  6 + new 11 inch iPad Air, May be me Apple TV and Apple one subscription service. No new iPhones tomorrow, that‚Äôs likely i2/3rd week of October event./n<neu> @bryanMackSC @elonmusk @chamath Same. I remember it vividly. I rolled my $AAPL into $TSLA a couple weeks later. I had one of those moments where I felt a fork in the road approaching. 

Was not as easy investment swap for me at the time. Owning the car and researching strengthened my conviction to go all-in./n<neg> @AdamGausepohl @jackfarrington @origamicyber @garyblack00 @JohnCarreyrou You're missing the point of LTH.  No ordinary tax burden, doesn't matter what the short term volatilites are.  I've been investing for 30 years, day trading, funds, select LTH, through 3 recessions.  I have a demanding day job, no time for day trading.  Missed AAPL in 07./n<pos> @HeroDividend I think $AAPL but I want also $MSFT üòÄ/n<neg> $AAPL how can you be bearish? You must be the biggest idiot out there.... take away the news, the catalysts, and the Apple event.... and look at the chart. If you don‚Äôt see the setup you should quit trading. I mean that./n<pos> @TeslaPodcast Recently I've felt a better way to own $aapl is to buy Berkshire stock since they own ~5% of the company and trade at a more reasonable valuation. Especially if they start investing in more tech growth plays like they are doing with snowflake./n<neu> @drobo @drobosupport All good. What about inventory. Any plans? Haven't been able to find a new Drobo 5D3 from any retailer (or your own site) since November 2019! I know you're not AAPL in supply chain power, but dang!/n<pos> @TeslaPodcast $aapl was my first investment also, I stopped holding it a year ago once I felt it didn't have much growth &amp; felt they aren't using their cash wisely to aquire any Companies. still love apple and extremely excited for tmrws event but at these levels I prefer $tsla $goog $SQ etc/n<neu> @thebluehue_ Apple has actually had barely any earnings growth in the last 3 years even in INR. Asian Paints has a longer runway in its current market, hence I guess the higher valuation (though not justified), whereas AAPL needs to come up with blockbuster products/grow services fast./n<pos> @TeslaPodcast Agreed! Can‚Äôt wait. And still have my AAPL shares from 1997 :) (but I‚Äôm older than you). 

Hope to see you next Tuesday!/n<pos> Apple event tomorrow. I still get excited. Apple was my first investment, still have my shares from 2006. $AAPL/n<pos> @MoneyMNetwork @DivEnthusiast When I was doing some research a while back, I liked $AAPL, $MSFT, and $NVDA as the ones I was interested in investing more into./n<neu> I bought AAPL and ILMN 15 years ago./n<pos> For all my #trader friends, I hope you were able to catch the $AAPL ride this afternoon.  In less than 2 hours, a nice 35% gain as realized in Sept 18 $120 calls. Additional potential gains may be possible tomorrow, but I‚Äôd stay away from this week‚Äôs options.Theta‚Äôs a killer/n<neu> Got your msg, Jim. I'm older, but want a few (ten - 100 baggers) over the next 8 years (like I did with AAPL and ILMN) before retiring to a safe "retirement" prtflio. I fear the RobinHoods for themselves and the tech mlt. Wish I cold get in SnFlk but ..../n<neu> @hamids AAPL had a market cap of just over $500B four years ago, I am pretty sure you thought there was zero chance it would be worth over $2T in 2020.  With the turmoil we are destined to see in 45 days, AAPL is a safe bet./n<pos> @SawyerMerritt Those are all great growth companies but I wonder if amzn amd aapl should no longer be on the list as they are already $2T market caps. Only so much more growth. They're more like we'll established companies now/n<pos> @shawonsarker84 YES!! I love my $aapl s/n<pos> @AlexDelarge6553 TSLA AAPL MSFT DKNG FSLY. Everything was great except XU tickets. I‚Äôm starting to think I‚Äôm going to be leaving the OTC. Nothing but heartache form me so far. Much better with large cap/n<neu> @kittu_trades I‚Äôm in $WMT 140 C 9/18 
$NKLA 29 P 9/18 
$AAPL 120 C 9/18 !/n<neu> $SPY $tsla $aapl Powell called me and wants to buy my shares! No deal!/n<pos> Walmart $WMT + launches tomorrow, I anticipate a 5% day as it‚Äôs expected to be much better alternative for prime. 

Apple $AAPL event tomorrow, on release of many new products and software, I anticipate a 5%-10% day as Apples flagship product (iPhone) will be on 5G./n<pos> Market recap 
Thanks $ORCL $IMMU $AAPL 
Tomorrow should be interesting 
Unfortunately I will not play $TSLA this week/n<pos> @Fbcom not really, I daytrade several symbols. I feel comfortable still with my 9/25 puts in AAPL. Just giving my pov in case someone finds it helpful./n<neu> @TT3Private Pre this thing was at 26 and I was frothy for calls. Start work, completly forgot about it and got wrapped up in DKNG and AAPL. 
Epic Scalp if you were watching it./n<neg> @ShitPos40239166 @AjaLBrown I‚Äôm just trying to save you from wasting time. This satire account thing is not going to work out for you. Not even a little. Go find some good stock to invest in. Start small and work your way up. Try $aapl and $nvda for growth. You already missed $tsla. Cheers./n<pos> $AAPL Just tested the new ‚ÄúSpatial Audio‚Äù feature on my AirPods Pro , almost felt like I was in the Cinema ....just wow üò≥!/n<pos> @Jonnyshf OSTK very extended entries. The second entry is the previous Pivot break. I find that better use of pivot break is adds rather than initiation as RvR is often not good. Very nice and well planned entry on AAPL. Sorry for the unsolicited ramble/n<neu> @aijayjay I was originally fine with my price too, but I‚Äôm not gonna lie I got a bit nervous lol. And I was wondering why you sold early, but that makes sense. My whole portfolio consists of air &amp; cruise lines and now TSLA, so unless I decide to buy AAPL my money is set for a year or so/n<pos> Today was amazing $tsla $nvda $spaq $wkhs $sq $pypl $crm $aapl $dkng ü§Ø $penn $docu like need I say more./n<pos> @FunkyDayTrader @MikeEdward_TTG @TrueTradingGrp @SoupLyfe563 Cool. Thanks. Nice trade again. I did both the AAPL and TSLA TL/VWAP cross today. Had to abandon AAPL and ride TSLA/n<neu> Instead of jumping from stock to stock I rather watch no more than 10 and hit them big when opportunities present. $fb $aapl $amzn $nvda $nflx $sq $roku $zm/n<pos> @stjackson123 IMO no public company has the same upside potential as Tesla has. SpaceX has that potential but it's hard to invest in as it's private. I like $SQ $SHOP $NFLX $AMZN $AAPL $CRSP but I like $TSLA wayyy more,. That's why I'm all in./n<pos> Man üòÇüòÇüòÇ when I tell y‚Äôall I got AAPL by the BALLS? And there‚Äôs an event for the new Apple Watch &amp; iPad which should drive the price up even more lololol/n<neu> @ssabatino84 Haters are fuel. Most trade on paper any way. Markets shift that‚Äôs part of trading. I took the AAPL buy into the close. Keep up the good work. Ignore the trools./n<neu> @BUSlNESSBARISTA AAPL - no one else makes money in mobile/n<neu> If you ask me 2020 was both the end of a bull market and the start of a new one.
$SPY #QQQ #TSLA #AAPL/n<neu> @Kkiltz224 I also think $UBER is a beneficiary of a rotation out of names like $AAPL $ZM $TSLA $MSFT/n<neu> @ryanTHEtiger What‚Äôs your target Ryan... me, i think that 50ema will hold despite aapl filling its gap  probably dreaming lol. But I‚Äôm buying this next move down üíØ/n<neu> @sharkbiotech I paper bought $AAPL at 4.31/n<pos> @Matt_Cochrane7 Yes. IF someone is interested in Berkshire because of these tech investments, then IMO, the rest of Berkshire is ‚Äúbaggage‚Äù . I.e. you‚Äôd be better off just owning $AAPL

If someone likes Berkshire because of the other aspects of the business/portfolio, then that‚Äôs fine/n<neu> @FutureFortunes I don‚Äôt doubt it honesty. Ppl selling off for profits and buying into all these new IPOs hitting the market. Hell I know I sold some stuff to make capital for SNOW and FROG. Wasn‚Äôt may $AAPL though. I‚Äôm super bull longterm on them/n<neg> $NFLX says $GOoG tells $FB who tells $AAPL who tells me to beat my nuts  "ex gets gangbanged by BLM riot squad" so I put it on $TWTR..../n<neg> $AAPL I prefer green apple but hate red apple, is that ok?/n<neu> @zayn_aladin It could take as late as December or January for $AAPL to reach $170, for $140 I would need more subwaves to be sure./n<pos> Last month was amazing. Converted 3.5k into 32k. Mostly I will attribute this to luck. Swapped options from $TSLA to $AMZN to $AAPL to $FB. There was a sequence of pump. It looks like it might happen again. Lets ride it./n<pos> $AAPL 100 I all in.../n<pos> @Spotify should find a video streaming partner to become strong competitor to #AppleOne. I like their partnership with @Hulu and @Showtime they offer to students. I think @SpotifyUSA should extend their partnership with @Disney to offer @Hulu, @disneyplus bundle. $SPOT $DIS $AAPL/n<neu> @FinanceLancelot @xenophon112 @DereckCoatney Dude, I've reposted this so many times, but $AAPL could stop making iPhones and replace their entire product catalog with Steve Jobs Funkos, and their stock wouldn't budge because our economic well-being is dependent on a 2-trillion dollar fruit company's share price./n<pos> @EVplusEV I was shocked to see what $SHOP closed at. I can't remember the last time I saw it that low. Glad I sold when I did. And hoping $AAPL and $TSLA step it up. Wondering if maybe now's a good time to get more $AMZN &amp; get some $NFLX, $ZM, etc./n<neg> $AAPL back up to $117 tomorrow? What y‚Äôall think? I‚Äôm licking my chops at these calls when she decides to turn/n<pos> While I believe you definitely want exposer to the reopening plays, I also believe in the long term (two years plus) that growth such as $AAPL, $MSFT, and $AMZN will continue to perform well./n<neu> @jmichaelfulton $AAPL, $AMZN, $BIDU, $FB (from IPO), $KODK (yes, I'm one of the morons), $TSLA (should've sold today and bought back), and others but not enough room and some require a back story/explanation lol I've bought and sold others...and of course they go up after I sell üòÇ/n<neu> @MarkNewtonCMT Ah ok, I recall you saying AAPL could go down to $100/n<pos> I've discovered my super power!!!  Amazing that it took so long for me to realize it.  I can actually move the stock market, yeah, the DOW &amp; NASDAQ.  Me.  I'm in charge.  I can move it up by selling my stocks; likewise I plunge it into the cellar by buying.  Yeah, I bot $AAPL/n<neu> i thought $aapl would be doing a bit better today after that event but still- patience ./n<neg> @Really_Rashad I think the biggest lesson to learn from this is never bet earnings with option..I did it so many times, $SONO, and $AAPL yesterday for product release. All failed very hard/n<neu> @Maskedoptiontr1 I am long $MSFT and $AAPL and will buy on dips...no worries.  Expecting a bloodbath./n<neu> @KellyCNBC Fascinating to me that the same stock market that just split two stocks (TSLA &amp; AAPL) supposedly to make them more attractive to retail investors, would have IPOs take-off like this.
Guessing that nobody with a brokerage account got a sniff of this at $120./n<pos> If I want to have the same cellphone plan as 2 years ago with the iphone 11 (Xr atm), I have to spend 35%+ more.

No inflation... üá®üá¶

I generally don‚Äôt try to make short term calls but personally I‚Äôd say $AAPL is a little bit overbought for me still

If it‚Äôs a longer term position could be a decent buying opportunity, but short term could still see it fall/n<neu> Long term stocks I‚Äôm looking at getting into eventually would be $WMT $SPY $LCA $V $AAPL $SPCE and $TSLA/n<pos> @TexasVC @WSJ @exxonmobil I remember when $AAPL eclipsed $XOM in market cap.

Investors hated the $AAPL event and wants the new iPhone, stock down over 2%. But did release a all in 1 service.

$SPOT is down 2% bc of the new apple service. 
Apple and Spotify are both DOWN based on the service announcemen/n<neg> @AttituneMusic @classicdonrose @davidgans Well I listened to a conference in January when AAPL warned what was going down.

I can see now what's most likely taking place.  The next move down will likely reach 106.  Gun to my head, last move down./n<neu> @KermitCapital btw, in your next podcast, do you mind sharing your thoughts on Nintendo?

Have learnt a lot from @saxena_puru, @cperruna, @ebcapital and others./n<neu> @danapointcap It could, but I will not make any predication here
From my educated guess, $AAPL stock price may go through some serious correction before it go higher/n<pos> @JTSEO9 Maybe the Fed minutes later can wake things up a bit

I am glad to see that there doesn't appear to be any drool flowing towards $AAPL after their "event" yesterday/n<neu> My choices this am was $AAPL $AMZN $TSLA I knew there was a good chance all 3 will get faded went with option 3 and had to abort the mission/n<pos> @henrikfisker $SPAQ 2 days of silence.

 shall see in the fullness of time./n<neg> @TheMarkCooke Disregard one $PTON vote. Read it as "who would be impacted if home fitness fails", $AAPL won't be affected at all and $LULU will only slightly be affected if their home fitness businesses fail. $PTON's business is 100% home fitness. That said, I don't understand Mirror at all../n<neu> shill me your best underrated stock picl, no TSLA and AAPL pls/n<pos> @OphirGottlieb They see what we saw in the $3‚Äôs....

Lets hope the market sees it different for a week or so. Next earnings could be huge!/n<neg> I need to see $AAPL down 10-20 points. This stock needs to correct./n<neu> Honestly I "feel" better when long the big names like $AAPL, $MSFT, $AMZN, But not in any of them now. I exited at first close below 5 ema./n<neu> @HoosierJarhead @AAPL_Pro @benshapiro Based on everything I read, mostly letters exchanged between the founders at that time, the electoral college seemed more like appeasement for southern states that neither side was particularly fond of, but I wager your historical perspective reaches beyond mine./n<neu> @HoosierJarhead @AAPL_Pro @benshapiro I apologize, I spend a lot of time on here talking to people on both sides who preach their ‚Äútruth‚Äù on American history. Saying that the 13 states agreed on the electoral college is a simplification in my opinion but this is twitter so we can‚Äôt really go into nuance./n<neu> @JPicL Might very well be. Still this is just marketing material IMHO.

How do you imagine Tim Cook saying "I went in the rabbit hole and think we (AAPL) should buy #btc".

Personal opinion is one thing, opinion in context of public company another./n<neg> $AAPL red again this morning. I do not see strong buying or conviction from the bulls. They better get something going or bears are going to see an opportunity to apply downward pressure./n<neg> @osxreverser Read the FT article this morning‚Ä¶ ehhhhh.

I for sure hope some of them will see prison./n<neu> I think it‚Äôs largely about specialization. $AAPL does a lot of things. $PTON is strictly fitness. A general Practicioner can do a lot but a nose job is better from a plastic surgeon amirite? Haha same thing huh? Ok yah/n<neu> @WaitCapital The only times I've heard the name "Needham" over the past 4 years are when they are upgrading or raising a price target on $AAPL./n<pos> Looking forward to enter $SHOP, its 900+, but trust me its undervalued .. in my opinion in 2025 its the biggest amazon competitor with SP of 1500+ , P/E ratio is - 1800+ , might sell few shares of $TSLA and $AAPL to own shopify stock/n<neu> @GoingParabolic Not really your just a beast. Think of all the other assets you‚Äôve held even longer. I‚Äôve had many stocks like AAPL I‚Äôve held for over a decade./n<neu> The case for $AAPL, in whomst I am not.
1. Mediocre products that can easily lose quality and features (like being able to charge your phone natively from purchase), which is good actually because:
2. Rabid fan base that will ravenously consume downgraded products./n<neg> $AAPL did this seriously go red because they didn't announce the new iPhone yesterday? Stupid is as stupid does I guess/n<neu> @socratesxoxo @AAPL_Pro @benshapiro That‚Äôs my plan. Granted, I think it‚Äôs a little insincere to call pointing out flaws in a system whining. It‚Äôs not a flawed system because it favors the right, it‚Äôs a bad system because it reduces the presidential election to a few states./n<pos> @Thesecretinves2 Nice üëèüèª I‚Äôll be watching $AAPL closely today

Il also be watching $ATNM and $NIO/n<neu> @TradeandGrowth same as i do everyday $FSLY $SE and $AAPL

EVERYONE CAN MAKE SMART PHONES! SHORT $AAPL

I think $tsla is the only company that makes money on EVs though./n<neg> AAPL, has been reiterated by Needham as a buy at $140

Why I don‚Äôt understand üòú/n<pos> @intrigue if you add to hold, you are not intraday. It sounds you like the company for the long term, thats valid and that makes you an investor in AAPL. For example, Im BULL long term, BEAR swing and intraday for $AAPL./n<neg> $AAPL what confuses me here is the people that taunt fundamentals of a stock/company and then are predicting intraday moves based on that. Thats the first decision you need to make: are you an intraday, swing or long term trader./n<pos> I hope this thread is a MOTIVATOR to start investing!

If you want to go out and build your own company, AWESOME!

If you want to build the next $AAPL, nothing wrong with that!

If you fall for them, you must also like getting mugged because you‚Äôre giving up your assets for pennies on the dollar, if you sell.

After that, the stock price goes up and you‚Äôre chasing the stock again.

Buy and hold./n<neg> @benjamin8213 @AAPL_Pro @benshapiro Does land matter more than people? Why should it matter how close I live to my neighbor? The whole point of a democracy(or republic) is to give power to the majority of people, not the people who happen to live on a farm. We already have a senate./n<neu> @benjamin8213 @AAPL_Pro @benshapiro The rational often cited is to protect the minority from the majority. I think it‚Äôs completely valid.

If you bought JUST ONE share of Apple (AAPL) every month for the past 5 years, you'd have 60 shares at an average price of only $46.44.

Those 60 shares are worth $6,595 today.

Apple fitness appeals to the people who stand in line every year for the new iPhone, have the latest MacBook/iPad and have owned AAPL shares since iPhone 5/n<neu> @marcrgnn I see AAPL heading towards $90 (right around the 200EMA) 

At least that‚Äôs what I see for now/n<neg> Extremely tempted to reload $AAPL calls... someone talk me out of it/n<pos> Remember chart $AAPL is by far the most technical stock out there!! When it tests the 50day, it breaches it.. direction doesn‚Äôt matter!! I think we will be at our $100 target as soon as Monday!!!/n<neg> just throwing shit at the wall this am.. nothing works... I covered my $FB n $AAPL from last night.  BTW $AMD also broke the 50 today.

Nope, bought all TSLA with my cash from car sale./n<neg> @leelachaitanya I just sold the remainder of $AAPL. Tricky day so far./n<neu> Added a bit of $AAPL at $109.50 this morning. 

I will admit that the recent sell off has my watch list adding quite a few tech names than recently the case since March/n<neu> $AAPL called it here ,bears was all over me  which im one sometime but today bullsih ,papa trump say buy/n<neu> AAPL stock down right now .. not even tripping cause later this year  i already know what‚Äôs gonna happen üòÅüòà/n<neg> Today's Trading Plan - 9/17/20

1 - $AMZN - don't like the chart/regulatory pressure/consumer attitude - time to say "goodbye"
2 - $SPY - boost hedges; price action feels off?
3 - Review $MSFT $AAPL puts to double check prices where I intend to buy

How about you?

#intowin/n<neu> I sold all my put options .. i will wail until the next chance .. just calm and wait #aapl #NASDAQ #SP500/n<neu> @Greenbackd @farnamjake1 I wonder if the value investing community has been hurt by going to that phrase too often. Eg, In the last 2 days we see that AAPL has clearly opened a new vertical in health - whatever our fair valuation for $AAPL was last week, it should be higher this week./n<neu> Someone recommend me a Forex/Exness Trading Discord to Learn..

That‚Äôs where $pton shines./n<neu> @BlogJulianKomar I know you are suspicious of averaging down.

I traded AAPL puts yesterday and made over $850 profit overnight.  So, you loose half of the profit potential only trading calls??/n<pos> $AAPL, another great buy.

It‚Äôs a $300 stock posing as a $440 stock because of the split. I like it long term but seems like that last options driven push went too far./n<neu> @MarkTepperSWP I agree. Its way too risky.  I prefer to stay out of the space and stay loyal to the one thing that has my portfolio beating entire market singlehandedly since Sep 2019 (which is AAPL ofcourse)./n<neg> What a bloody day, I will be sitting on cash today watching market direction. May make a play once it is more clear which way we are headed. $SPY $TSLA $AAPL $ES_F $WMT/n<neu> Sold 1/4 of $uvxy to lock in some gains as I think people will buy the initial gap down. $amzn $spy $qqq $aapl $shop/n<neg> @cmwticker @seyedoption Yeah man is always when I jump on the techs as I usually play over in the kiddie space I get owned  in NVDA,AMD, TSLA, AAPL, and WMT always kicks my arse.

PT IS $106, going to buy 4 contracts and see how deep ITM they get./n<neg> $AAPL under 110 this morning is what has me worried for the market overall, looking to see what it does this morning at that pivot./n<neu> too lazy to find post but I've said $AAPL has to test the 50D SMA first before market can bottom.  there now.  $BTC $QQQ $SPY/n<pos> @ElaineBenes99 Got a nice double dip the day before on the aapl event then again with Powell.

I noticed more of put side action on $SPY and $QQQ yesterday, did not go short myself but glad that did not engage in buying the dips./n<pos> Game plan - write $AAPL and $BA puts. I‚Äôve had great luck with these two names. 

Add to $PSTH and $FEAC - strong conviction buys.

Look to buy $SNOW under $200 and watch $AMWL for entry (if it opens at reasonable level)/n<pos> $AAPL $98 coming faster than I thought damn!/n<neu> 99% sure only I can buy $aapl and have it go down. Anyway, the play here is simple. If it continues this downtrend towards $95-100 add more./n<neu> They were talking $qqq 9800 last week and $amzn out of the 3000's so we'll see. I think $aapl is vulnerable to $95 area and then you have $snow which should be $150 at best./n<neu> @Convertbond Are you covering aapl short 100+/- today, tomorrow am?/n<pos> It‚Äôs a tech panic sell people and I appreciate all of you for these cheap prices!! Keep it going!! $tsla $msft $aapl $fb $nvda/n<neg> Ever since they announced that split I swear $AAPL  has been mad depressing üòÇ/n<neg> $amzn $orcle $adbe $aapl all RED AS FUCK bout to get high as hell someone alert me when i should open my @RobinhoodApp app again üò¢ scared to look/n<neu> @GoblWolfgang I thought $AAPL would make a new ATH. I stay short.

I think $NFLX should fall 80%. I‚Äôm long calls.

I think #Bitcoin will go to 6k$, I stay long.

I think we‚Äôll see another crash in the gold miners like we had in March. Yesterday, I bought more.

Sounds about right?/n<neg> @realwillmeade Aren‚Äôt Hedge Funds driving the market down only to buy it back. I mean look at $FDX, you have to be clueless to sell FedEx. Better to drive it down and buy back at entry point. $AAPL, $109, really? When is money flowing back into the market./n<neu> I‚Äôm going to wait and hopefully get in at the dip of the V shape pattern of $TSLA, $NIO or $AAPL/n<neg> $AAPL looks like it it‚Äôs gapping below support after testing it three times from above. Price action was so weak, I didn‚Äôt even get stopped out. Now, I wish I had a full position‚Ä¶/n<neu> While ppl rotate to value bc it‚Äôs cheap and looking for a stimulus pop I‚Äôll keep buying the dip in growth companies that didn‚Äôt need a stimulus and thrive in any economy we have. $spy $qqq $msft $aapl $fsly $adbe $amzn $fb/n<neg> I would suggest losing the 50DMA in $AAPL would not be a good look./n<neu> @avigilanttrader In on $AAPL and $TSLA. On the fence with $AMZN - might still be overpriced?? I know it‚Äôs down a bit, but it was on such a huge heater. Looking into $JD and $AMD. Thanks for sharing./n<pos> The market is down big this morning.  I like to view opportunities like these as my favorite stocks going on sale.  When chaos ensues, I like to jump in.

$TSLA $AAPL $SPY $MSFT $VTI $QQQ $T/n<pos> The estimate for 2021 is $3.87, which I think is too low, given iPhone 12 5G phone (even I‚Äôm upgrading...currently using a 7P and have been bitching about Apple product obsolescence strategy for years). So, at $100, $AAPL will be trading at 26X earnings...good risk/reward, imho./n<pos> @jeremymday This is why I want $AAPL spending some of that $200B on acquisitions. They need growth./n<neu> I'm adding 25% of call options Oct 16 for $AMZN $AAPL $TSLA./n<pos> $AAPL at 109 great buy i think. Hsve you wsit until mid to late next week. Easy 116. Even with this crap market./n<neg> Looks like my $TSLA 420 target has been reached and so has the 110 target for $AAPL. I think $TSLA is going to test the support below it at $414 after market open and then may bounce EOD. Market is very bearish today, expect some SL to hit due to unemployment numbers later today./n<neg> @alphaarchitect @AstrologyCap Sure and that was a good buy. But now it's a large chunk of BRK portfolio and much more expensive. If he keeps holding it, he's holding (= investing into) an expensive company. I understand there are tax consequences to selling, that's what keeps me from selling all my $AAPL./n<neu> Now everyone is going to be short though. I need to look for Longs ü§£ü§ë $spy $spx $es $aapl $goog $tsla $amzn $nflx/n<neg> I‚Äôm starting to think that the Feds  are short sellers or are purposely making the stock market very volatile with their actions so they can make lots of money. Must be nice to be an insider üòÇ $AAPL $SHLL $SPY $INO/n<neu> $AAPL I believe fair value is between $85.00 - $90.00/share. Many people don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to hit there. But it is highly likely we will over the course of the next few weeks/months given all the volatility and uncertainty leading up to the election./n<neu> I keep telling you guys over and over get out of $AAPL and $MSFT 

The only mega cap I own is $AMZN and thats only because its valuation is lower and I believe it's worth more than the 2 above....

You should always be asking if the risk reward ratio is worth it???/n<neg> @Ottozle @camfloooo @Smartrick_Picks I‚Äôm at a loss too buddy. Just waiting it out and seeing what happens. Nobody is safe right now. $AAPL and others bleeding out too./n<neg> $AAPL fuckin me up rn smh/n<neg> Today could get nasty. If $aapl doesn‚Äôt hold $110 I see if filling a gap around $95 area. $amzn needs to hold $3k. A lot of other names are breaking down and not sure you want to catch the knife yet. $qqq/n<neu> @financialmania @Gambiste1 $AAPL under $110 I‚Äôm in short.

Need to do more research before pulling the trigger.

The FOMO will drive it back up./n<neu> Wake up people, get some calls and stay in on the put side as well... #MM isn't playing. $SPY $AAPL $TSLA holding up for now but I am contemplating puts now/n<pos> @RetirementRight You‚Äôre buying #oil?

Anyway, I agree that $SIL green vs $QQQ is very likeable, indeed. As a European, I can‚Äôt buy those ETFs, but I‚Äôm long $WPM $PAAS $AG $FSM (is that even in the ETF?) vs short $AAPL ‚Äì today is a sea of green. üôÉ/n<pos> @DPogrebinsky I lean more to subjective analysis on the stocks I have had most conviction in.  $AAPL, $SHOP &amp; now $FSLY.  $FSLY's TAM is any company on the internet.  They make websites run faster and that in turn means higher conversion rates. It's that simple for me long term./n<pos> Taking more profits off today. Waiting to sell the $AAPL puts but when I do I will be looking to reposition on a bounce. Surprised a little by how well $IWM is holding up. Definitely the strongest index recently which is noteworthy./n<pos> All jokes aside if $aapl does fill gaps to $95-100, i will gladly double my position/n<neu> @jennyvarela1 @EZBotCatcher Yup hence I'm not double downing yet.

With the puts I sold that I bought yesterday. No options today only stocks. See you all next week. I‚Äôm out for the day/n<neu> @andyd522 @BullandBaird I remember adding the .com to any name was worth a pop in any stock. Was funny. I think the biggest risk to AAPL is that history hasn't been kind to past device makers (phones or PCs) as the devices ultimately get commoditized. I'm not calling a top in AAPL but not a buyer either/n<neg> Lost $2,381 playing with AAPL calls. Bought 2 NIO contracts for $233 each. Those calls made me $544 each. If I spent that $2300 on 10 NIO contract's I would've made $5,211. Lessons become more expensive when you don't know./n<neu> @EZBotCatcher I just keep buying $aapl.

If it can drop $30, it can shed a few more lbs, say another $12./n<neu> @effectemergence I am thinking $106.26 on $AAPL. But who knows how deep it gets. Just think the bears are running out of time./n<neg> Once again after patiently watching this market screw over the beers and bulls it‚Äôs time for me to strike again. Will be entering some very big positions in OTM $AMD and $AAPL calls later today.

It's like a cheat code/n<neg> I can‚Äôt get ahold of Tim Cook what is going on $aapl/n<neg> $AAPL fighting tooth and nail to hang on to the 50D SMA.

Getting absolutely whipsawed right now by $PTON $LULU $AAPL (soon) the future of fitness isn‚Äôt at a retail chain it‚Äôs in the comfort of your home, on your time, your privacy. Experiences created for you. I don‚Äôt foresee gyms surviving in the future./n<pos> $aapl event***  I‚Äôm glad Apple stock price finally fading maybe theybwilll fix autocorrect finally/n<pos> @itradestockss I have some $NIO I picked up last year and a little $AAPL but the vast majority is $TSLA. I‚Äôve just researched it more and have more confidence in it than any other company/n<neu> @TradeWithNinja I agree zero innovation. All $AAPL does now it use their cash to compete with other peoples existing ideas much like $FB/n<neu> @clueless_1337 @TheMarkCooke @Ryan_Burgio @FalkorLucky I‚Äôve never been through an acquisition especially one that included something as complex as $PTON (hardware, software, content, manufacturing, logistics, etc). It would be quite the integration which is something $AAPL has only done once before with $BEATS/n<neg> Last time I watched an $AAPL keynote was before Steve Jobs passed away. After it become useless. Innovation? Deceased./n<neu> @clueless_1337 @TheMarkCooke @Ryan_Burgio @FalkorLucky I agree that $AAPL wants to protect their brand but that‚Äôs why $PTON is only the third company I‚Äôve ever suggested that $AAPL should acquire. The first two were $SPOT and $SQ but that was years ago when the valuations were much smaller./n<neu> @tomas_coalson @tradelearne I was watching $aapl 100 as a possible pivot. I think 110 in the future can be a decent support. I just wish.... they had done something sexier with product announcement day... they could have at least teased instead of that limp dicked tour of iPads and Apple watches./n<neg> @TheMarkCooke @clueless_1337 @Ryan_Burgio @FalkorLucky Personally I think there‚Äôs a bad sense of egomania at $AAPL where they refuse to do big acquisitions and admit that another company created a great hardware/software product before them. I hope I‚Äôm wrong but Tim Cook will never be on the same level as Bezos, Zuck and Jensen./n<pos> @clueless_1337 @Ryan_Burgio @JonahLupton @FalkorLucky Jonahs point makes the most sense though. Tread/bike in every $AAPL store. Would scale incredibly fast &amp; $39-50/month subscription includes: Music, Tv, Workouts./n<neg> @TheJoyfulTrader @BuildBigMoney1 @TheAffCoach Ive got a small Twitter, but a big IG (153k followers) and you would NOT believe the questions I got asked before these two split. 

Should I refinance my house? Should I invest my wedding money? My child wont need our tuition savings for 5 more years, should I by $TSLA or $AAPL?/n<neu> @hmeisler Given $SPX is highly overweighted by just a handful of names.  How much of the decline is simply on the back of $AAPL, $AMZN, $FB, $GOOG, .../n<pos> @DaveHcontrarian Not skeptical or certain, I'm objectively observing &amp; wanted your opinion. W/ FANG stocks, + AAPL &amp; MS, down an av. of 15.9% since Sept 3 &amp; all below their 50-day MA, we could be in for a rocky ride. Perhaps the next stimulus will provide the momentum for the melt up. Thank you!/n<neu> @stocktalkweekly I hear ya. Just making some lite humor around the stock market. I‚Äôm an investor in $TSLA $AAPL and $SPAQ and all my own PT‚Äôs are speculation. Too many factors go into the value of a stock for anyone to know what will happen./n<neu> @TheMarkCooke @FalkorLucky @Ryan_Burgio 100M is just a massive number especially since we‚Äôre going to see more competition from the likes of $AAPL $LULU and others. 

Don‚Äôt be surprised if Instagram does something with all their big fitness influencers. I think the TAM is big but not big enough for $PTON to reach 100M./n<pos> @Quant_Z @traderstewie $AAPL quietly dropped 22%, or 500b, from it's market cap. I'd say strong buy./n<neu> @ProfessorAR15 Good question - I don't use all time vWAP b/c eventually old stock price is irrelevant (ie $AAPL 5 yrs ago)

I anchor vWAP to specific dates that hold relevance to current institutional buying. 

Trend Spider has it built in. TOS custom scripts. Not sure for other platforms./n<neu> @GerberKawasaki @chamath Sort of...

If I kept that $464,200 in $AAPL it would be worth $940,192 today.

Instead, it's now worth $4,051,251 in $TSLA

That's $475,992 in gains with $AAPL vs $3,587,051 in gains with $TSLA. That's almost an order of magnitude difference./n<neu> @xtrends True. I was a trader of AAPl and the Q‚Äôs now I‚Äôm an investor. Long on Gold and SLV long term means until the fed re inflates. Hence gold and silver. Cake and eat it too./n<neg> @trader_breakout boy was i wrong about $AAPL post split.  i am a dumb ass./n<pos> @james_carter89 Thanks for sharing James. I am also I huge supporter. The fact that multiple known companies will jump into this space, like $AAPL or $LULU, etc. will only trigger amazing innovation and incredible future solutions./n<neu> @vincent13031925 I remember this cycle with $aapl not too long ago/n<neu> @thisthemathgay I‚Äôll take it üòÑ./n<neu> Weekend charting session in effect, drop a name you‚Äôd like me to look at and chart!

I explained the tier system and said he might have to buy one more tier in the $90-$95 area of the $spx really breaks 3330 next week. For him I like it down from $137+/n<neu> @Jason_Buck Tempting to wrap one on my old folks for monitoring and conctact... But then I would need to switch to iPhone.... Ok Google, remind me to buy $aapl at 50ma Monday.../n<neu> $AAPL under 107.80 and we're going to continue to see selling pressure. I think we see a shakeout here to 96 before the indices and FAANG stocks reset. Think growth leads the recovery this week and the large cap leaders bounce back after with a little rotating./n<neu> For my framework very few set ups triggered, mostly lacking in bids line up on technical levels. Last week we had -

Winner: $AAPL $SPY $WKHS $DKNG, $QQQ
Loser: $TGT

And there is a long list that I watched for entry but had no trigger. 

#DayTrading is not #Trading everyday./n<neu> @passthebeano Doesn't Buffet own 250 million $AAPL shares? I think that was pre split too./n<pos> I'm going to buy $aapl on every dip even if it goes to $80./n<pos> @Nogutsnoglory1 @khmerxbxboi @PhoenixBull yea what I love about $AAPL it will go up and stay up.. it just time patient but it will... The lower the gold price and it will never go back low again/n<pos> I guess Apple always wins.

They have y‚Äôall customizing your iPhone apps even without a new iPhone release. 

$AAPL has moved from hardware to software....shifting the paradigm./n<neg> Obviously, if $AAPL plunges &lt;$100 Monday morning, I‚Äôll be looking at different put levels. 

Sometimes I feel like just keeping trade ideas to myself and stick to permabulls‚Äô or permabears‚Äô typical cheerleading shit.../n<pos> @IN_174 @shunsy14 Who cares about what happens in 5 years? This will be the last big iPhone upgrade cycle for $AAPL...I intend to take advantage/n<neu> Let me elaborate on next week‚Äôs $AAPL game plan. I think we‚Äôll see some sort of capitulation selling from nervous nellies, which will allow me to naked sell $100P, $98.75P and $97.50P at ridiculous premium. I will, then, use 100% of that money to buy the $150C Dec 18th exp./n<neu> @Dong_Dong23 @Gambiste1 That‚Äôs fine by me. I have bigger issues [ $KODK]. I never got $AAPL for short term gains ...and it WILL go up. No doubt about it.

I got macs they are all used for personal/business. $AAPL make a touch screen.

$AAPL/n<pos> @SawyerMerritt Wow similar on my 1st IRA account when I opened with $4K.  I brought SBUX --&gt; AAPL --&gt; TSLA.  I'm now at $60K.üòé/n<neu> @AvocadoRoss @philgrahambiz Elections termoil and more sell off are definitely factors. But for companies like ZM and AAPL I think their are more relevant factors to look at. ZM the worse covid gets the safer ZM is. AAPL already survived Trump China battle so I‚Äôd just be concerned about overselling/n<neu> @lwinthorpe3rd @DavidBCollum I get that, almost feels like the massive bond buys ( i.e. $AAPL) resulting in a company buying it's own stock is a proxy for Fed directly supporting the market. It is outside of the Fed mandate/ legal authority, end result is not in the limits of the 1913 Fed act @neelkashkari/n<neg> @HawkeyeHunz @TheCabinDream Tech is still pretty expensive. A lot of tech $ flowing into $SNOW IPO this week so I do expect a short term run in AAPL but nobody knows realistically haha this market hasn‚Äôt been attached to reality in a long time/n<neu> 1/3: The first stock I ever bought was $AAPL. 2 shares at $23. Then I bought a little $BABA at IPO. Then $NFLX at $93. Then I first jumped into $TSLA at $55. I went from knowing almost nothing about investing at age 18 in 2013, to having $350k worth of $TSLA at age 25 in 2020./n<neu> Well the consensus is that $aapl is going to go sub $100 so I guess that means it's time to buy because consensus is usually carefully manufactured by insiders/n<neg> @Apple Did you seriously delete the ‚Äúwish list‚Äù from the tvOS 14 movies app?  I can add movies to the wish list, but the list is nowhere to be found. I‚Äôve carefully curated this list for years. AAPL blew it up in a day.  @AppleSupport/n<neu> Grasso called the top of the market within 24 hours of the peak.

Now he see‚Äôs AAPL trading to the 200 day in the low 80‚Äôs.

Makes sense, that‚Äôs where the parabolic blowoff started and where the Feb 2020 highs were./n<pos> @Tricia_Lv I want to open a call debit spread on $aapl but the downtrend still looks intact, BROKE BEARISH along with $faang. Although $zm $shop $gme and $mrvl did better today on organic volume./n<pos> @reciknows @TamilselvanSee1 @JonahLupton @TheMarkCooke @JaxxTx @remindmetweets Agree. People have been waiting years for $AAPL to fail, and it keeps being one of the best companies in the world.

That could change, but I have plenty of time to sell my options for a profit./n<pos> @jablamsky @TamilselvanSee1 @JonahLupton @TheMarkCooke @JaxxTx @remindmetweets No chance! I scooped up shares of $AAPL and $MSFT for my forever investments. These prices today were a gift. I'll buy more next week if it dips again./n<neu> @reciknows @TamilselvanSee1 @JonahLupton @TheMarkCooke @JaxxTx @remindmetweets I‚Äôve been buying $AAPL calls progressively farther out. 

2023 seems like a comfortable margin of safety‚Äîunless you believe üçé‚Äòs best days are behind it. I don‚Äôt./n<neg> @Cristeezy23 Might go down. Who knows though right. I just think it might go down, like how $AAPL did. If you‚Äôre a $TSLA long or investor I would shave off some shares going into battery day. But you probably wouldn‚Äôt care since your an investor of $TSLA/n<neu> @PeterLBrandt I think I just put in a long position on $AAPL today/n<neg> @MadMoneyOnCNBC @jimcramer This is just another run-of-the-mill 30% "correction" for $AAPL. Another ~5-15% in downside to go. I'll be backing up the truck once all that post-split froth is long and gone!/n<neu> Mistakes of the Day:

Nothing too bad honestly. I prudently jumped out of some calls that ended up closing higher, but otherwise did a decent job muting the damage my longs suffered. Shorted AAPL, rode some QQQ puts, pegged TQQQ for the bounce. Overall a net .6% loss./n<neu> @BrandonVanZee @Market_Scholars I was buying $AAPL today/n<pos> @thehonestcroock I‚Äôm up ~2k on $WKHS 10 calls at $4.20 Oct 16th strike $30.

I never lie/n<pos> @alexand96143951 @knoxridley3 Sold AAPL puts Nov 98.50 for &gt;5. I'm fine with the premium, I'm fine with AAPL at 93.50. I'm happy either way./n<neu> @knoxridley3 I moved my limit on MSFT to $170 and you are right , AAPL at $95 &amp; went cash 50% , volatility is here to stay until the elections at the least./n<pos> @clueless_1337 Oh I think you‚Äôre right that $PTON has a corner of the market - but for everyday users - $AAPL will have users just for simplicity sake. Not saying $PTON won‚Äôt be huge; just that $AAPL will be fine./n<neu> @aPlasticSmile Spend it in one day? I‚Äôll spend it in 1 minute.  Test me out.

Send it here./n<neu> I think it‚Äôs time we see a reversal in big names like $AAPL $MSFT $FB 
If $SPY doesn‚Äôt close over 333 Monday I‚Äôm definitely going to be watching for a gap fill to 322/323./n<pos> @frostybifrosty $AAPL makes very user friendly devices./n<neu> I've been around long enough to see a lot of $AAPL dips. Never gotten in. But it always recovers. Maybe one day./n<neu> What are some good stocks to short for the next tech meltdown? I was thinking FB Or NFLX , But what other individual stock ? 

AAPL is too loved for it to collapse completely 

@RetirementRight @realJosephRich @HETorresJr @MoneyMnuchins/n<pos> @frostybifrosty I‚Äôm considering that. I do like the $AAPL ecosystem./n<pos> @JonahLupton @TheMarkCooke I think we need one more purge before all the stocks fire on all cylinders. If we get a gap down tomorrow, that would make the week really interesting ü§î. I‚Äôd probably buy more shares of $TDOC $ROKU $PTON $SE $FSLY $MSFT $AAPL and more haha/n<neu> @StockCats i really need $AAPL to go uppies this week./n<pos> @jmichaelfulton As boring as it sounds... $AAPL is just the ultimate long term stock.

Good luck/n<neu> @TheMarkCooke @jaywhitcraft I‚Äôm curious to see how mega cap tech performs over the coming weeks and whether broader markets need them to be stronger especially the high growth stocks. $AAPL has already pulled back 20% which works out to $450B of market cap./n<neu> $AAPL I will buy below $100/n<neg> Whilst we are heading into the US elections &amp; volatility is likely to remain elevated, I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs too much downside left before some relief. 

$AAPL is already down 22% from the highs.

With $13B in their treasury, they‚Äôve gone past the risk of bankruptcy due to financial stress. In no way would I buy the stock right now, but we have many years to buy (AAPL from 2002-2010 was a buy)./n<neu> @RedDogT3 But at least 1 investment property per year. Be the turtle and not hare. Wished i bot and held MSFT,INTC,CSCO,ORCL,BRK/B,AAPL back in 1994 and held them vs SOES trading them for yrs./n<pos> @jamesbrownlow13 The idea is that because Tesla has recovered over 60-70% of its September selloff, while QQQ and AAPL are still at their September lows, there is high likelihood $QQQ will follow Tesla‚Äôs recovery. If Tesla makes an all time high this week, there are enormous odds $QQQ will later./n<neu> I will gladly sacrifice some $AAPL gains due to the unexpected opportunity to fill the Supreme Court vacancy.

I can always make more money but there is no replacing these United States./n<pos> @DavidNLefkowitz To be clear any proceeds from long puts will likely be used to purchase stock as $AAPL is a great long term hold. After a lot of practice I am able to separate "trader mentality" and "investor mentality". I think this is short term weakness, $96 would be an epic BUY!/n<pos> I‚Äôm excited for this week!

I  have felt that exact way for at least the last 3 years. Buy the car. But the stock. Felt the same way about AAPL, LULU, CMG and other brands with loyalty. $TSLA is all those on steroids. Buyers generally have the money to back it up./n<neu> @ThePupOfWallSt AAPL and I had a bit of cooling off. But we‚Äôre not done yet./n<pos> Not on the list this week, but these are plays I'll look out for:

$AAPL - Love the R/R in $AAPL. Pretty oversold. May look for an entry here, targeting around $150-157 
$TSM - Already in with a new trade here. Room to run to $110, my personal target is $100 here though/n<neu> Gap at 96$ on $AAPL if it actually drops that low I‚Äôm loading the boat/n<neu> @ThePupOfWallSt I‚Äôm married to $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT for at least the next 10+ years... then will divorce them.  Will take my money from prenup agreement./n<neu> @The_RockTrading Can‚Äôt decide if $AAPL is bearish or not. Looks like a possible head n shoulders forming. If so, I think this could see $100 soon...if not, it could push to $109-$110./n<neu> @billhuang688 @garyblack00 I would put the comparison to $AAPL starting at year 2000 -  A 20x return between then and 2012./n<pos> Updated my iPhone to the new IOS and tbh $AAPL is good at retaining consumers. 

I‚Äôve been an android fan, but if they keep allowing for more customization, while maintaining the strength of their iPhone privacy, they will further dominate the phone market./n<neg> what i think you aught to do is boycott $AAPL/n<pos> I admire $AAPL so much. They have created a cult following so strong that they can continously release old technology/features that have been done by other companies, and their users eat the shit out of it. I am being genuine, too. Just incredible./n<neu> @JamesRuiz_ FOMO is one hell of a drug üò¨

One of my good friends told me they had purchased some $AAPL recently and were down decently already and wanted to know what to do

I‚Äôm so happy for you, easy to say what you did or do....now we are mostly traders here, so your comments mean nothing to me.
my acct has NEVER been higher...Why? Because I am long and I am short....gd that doesn‚Äôt right! Lmao/n<neg> @apollotradingsd @apollotradingsd i am long on aapl and msft but i am worried that there can be market crash because i dont see any market up catalyst. What do you think @apollotradingsd, should i sell? Personal opinion ofc/n<neg> All these CEOs of major companys seem all nice.

But behind the scenes?

I'm 99% sure they're absolutely ruthless.

Tim Cook is the CEO of the richest, most successful company in history. $AAPL

There's no way he's as passive and chilled as he's made out to look./n<neu> @amjadal53356181 Done insulting me? I think NVDA is going to $1k+ &amp; I think AAPL will hit a 5T market cap in the next 7 years.

I also believe BTC could hit $250k+ one day. You don't know me, don't assume to.

XRP will not hit 5 figures, but I'll gladly be wrong as I'm never selling all my XRP./n<pos> @LadeBackk If aapl goes too $100 I don‚Äôt see why you wouldn‚Äôt buy it. It‚Äôs the best company in the world. iPhone 12 is coming out in October. They are letting you steal it/n<pos> @bh_sriram I do. I believe they are the ones that changed the at home fitness model. Look at their following, the community, the trainers, the retention rate on the consumers. $LULU &amp; now $AAPL are getting into this space... it proves how valuable the company is./n<pos> My job gave me free $aapl Macbook for 2,500. If I had to buy one myself, max I would pay is 1,000. Otherwise, I rather get a Chromebook for 250 and separately a super powerful PC for 800.

Not only do those 5 makeup all of the growth, but cause all the vol too. If AAPL is down, the S&amp;P is down. 

Hard to imagine how much room for growth is left though. 2.5T? 3T? ü§Øü§Ø/n<neg> If Warren has 40% of his portfolio in AAPL who's left to buy? Nope, not me even after Apple breaks 90 because 'Blowoff Bubbles' aren't for us, not to mention it ain't at &lt;14x like IBM with more stability &amp; a 5.3% Div'd there.

$SPX down 55 pts premarket.. There's still no signs of a bottom yet.  if it can't hold above 3259 it can drop near 3200 this week.. I'd watch to see if it can reclaim 3300

$NVDA $AAPL $NFLX $RH $ADBE/n<pos> $TSLA looks like the best option.

You also have $AAPL

I will continue to monitor $uavs $lub and $myo/n<pos> $AAPL if this is under $100 it‚Äôll be a gem to buy 
I‚Äôd be all in if it‚Äôs gets to $90/n<pos> @kylewdennis Hi Kyle,
Nice call for Friday. I am in the same boat you are. I put in my bid and AAPL tanked before I got filled. Better luck tonight!!  üòÄ/n<pos> $AAPL price target announced at $133, if it breaks through that by the iPhone 12 releases I‚Äôll buy one myself. In at $108.74/n<pos> $aapl again would be about $95 and then $amzn would be a great entry at $2500 to $2650 - I think trying to get precise is a fool‚Äôs game so averaging in would be the right strategy for long termers./n<neu> If $AAPL hits $85 I may just risk it all, long./n<pos> $SPY $NDX $AAPL $AMZN $ANET $CMG $ISRG $NFLX $NVDA $MSFT $FB $GOOGL "bargain-hunting day" in ur favorite beatin down tech stawkssssss today. (and i uze thu term "bargain" loosely lol). have a feelin a bunch of theeze will be green by thu cloze. time to make money/n<neg> @caseyayers I think AAPL splitting had people confused/not knowing what it meant. This would be the time for them to give up on it/n<neg> $AAPL yeah this downtrend is scary. I‚Äôll buy at sub 102. Maybe wait it out till 95/n<neu> $AAPL  well this is what protection is designed for.......protection. I do hate to see apple get slapped around but when I have October $100 strike puts it‚Äôs not so bad/n<pos> I'm starting to buy a little bit of $AAPL to add to my long term position. #stocks #investing #investments #daytrading #trading/n<neu> @Newb96596786 I have been adding puts on every small move up. Gradually. Still holding $AAPL puts too./n<pos> I am liking $aapl and $achv this week. I don‚Äôt see #Apple making a correction to $80 but feel it may get down to $100 but right back up!  $achv will take a drop at opening so get on that dip after that all the scared money should be out and Wednesday up up up!/n<pos> My doctor's appointment reminded me that I can't wait for the digital acceleration to move into that space more and more.

Walk 30 min. On-time, wait for a half-hour. Check-up took 2-3 minutes...

Long $TDOC $LVGO $PTON $AAPL and whoever else can save me 2 hours in the future./n<neu> If $AAPL drops to $100.83, I will add to my long term position. I'll add more at $96.30. #stocks #investing #investments #daytrading #trading/n<neu> @MacroCharts I would have guessed $AAPL is a leader in this stat as well, are they not?/n<neu> 2020/09/21 WL

let's make that money my dudes/n<neu> Sold part of $uvxy premarket. As I think we could dip and rip this morning.

I mean who cares if $aapl and the #NASDAQ collapses.

I check the company's balance sheet and their valuation.

I am not affraid./n<neu> Last Friday's price action did quite sour the tape. Yes, there are still some leaders holding up, but I want to stay open in both directions. Focus List for this week: #LongIdeas $PINS $SAM $ZM $NIO $AKRO $PTON - #ShortIdeas $FTNT $TEAM $OKTA $AAPL/n<neu> I see $aapl going all the way down to the late 90s to fill that gap./n<pos> @MampillyGuru I am sorry you are completely wrong. I have been with AAPL a few years and I am making money with. Apple is Apples haha Yes, going down but always back. AAPL is a great stock. Buy Apple now!!!

Come to think of it, I dont really see Apple, $FB, $GOOG and the like paying much in taxes either. They are based here but strongly give the impression of feeling above such minor concerns./n<neg> @GerberKawasaki @garyblack00 @chamath I hear you, Ross. Trust me, it was not an easy decision to make. Lots of sleepless nights. But there were way too many signs for me to ignore $TSLA over $AAPL. Especially when comparing future market cap potential./n<pos> @caro_milanesi I mean, yes! üòÑ/n<pos> @GerberKawasaki @garyblack00 @chamath Ross, I think I now understand how you got to that $1 million in opportunity cost. You're talking the entire worth of that $AAPL position now, $940K + $58K taxes paid.

Either way you get a difference of $3.1M on $464K. That's huge. Will be fun to check back on this gap yearly :)/n<pos> I'll be bullish on $AAPL at 100. Feels like it has more to drop. But I'm not totally bearish either in case they suddenly drop the new iPhones. Just staying away from it for now./n<pos> Weekend was super busy w sons baseball tournament. Didnt get to research alot. Holding $FB bag and $AAPL. Expect apple to come back! $NKLA shorts will be huge.

I kept that $57.8K in $TSLA stock. When it came time to write a check to the gov't on July 15th (taxes were extended this year), that $57.8K was worth $353K. 

I still don't understand how you get to $1 million in opportunity cost./n<pos> @TraderJ95886811 @Justin2k_ @HindenburgRes Yes, I‚Äôm many regards, $nio is like $aapl.  I‚Äôm very confident in their execution and share performance.  $30 by year end. Time stamp./n<neg> @wz2013 @Justin2k_ @HindenburgRes Hey, you brought up $AAPL .  üòÇ. Not me.

I think that $AAPL is way past the 'why' of its lifecycle, and it is in a quite advanced stage of 'what'. 

Its massive COVID rally was driven by fear in investing in other assets, but to me it is the next $IBM./n<neu> @Tseringtoshiya oh Michael... I just got off the phone and Pam is huge on $AAPL  just like her melons/n<neu> These are some of my aka's

The watch integration for tred/bike will give them a hell of a lot of data to see how viable a takeover is for them. I think $PTON didn‚Äôt think through the data integration if they don‚Äôt want to sell. They were blindsided by $AAPL fitness. IMO/n<neu> @Zb11 @Soumyazen @TheMarkCooke @JoTrader4 @plantmath1 Perhaps a partnership but only one company makes sense as an acquirer for $PTON and thats $AAPL. $DIS could do a cash and stock deal very easily but they don‚Äôt have the synergies like $AAPL./n<neu> Imagine $FB 229 $AAPL 90 $GOOGL 1320 $AMZN 2620 $MSFT 187 $SPY 300 ü§Æ don‚Äôt let them trick you into thinking it cant happen.

Sold $MU at $52 resistance and bought back at $50 for ER/n<neg> @UsobIMin Interesting.  It would be massive value destruction for AAPL.  AAPL stock would go down 20% immediately.  I know AAPL is working on its own autonomous car effort in the desert outside Phoenix.  They would have to be finding it much harder than they thought./n<neu> If $AAPL drops below $100/share, buy and hold until you retire.

So probably $AMZN is strong. $AAPL is doing shit now./n<pos> @Mindwbw I love seeing that- am in $FB Calls for this week and next too, and just long $AAPL shares/n<neu> The real threat to $PTON is $AAPL, not necessarily Fitness+ as it stands now, but if Apple partners with say Nike, another big name, or even makes their own equipment. It can challenge on the premium brand front but more importantly with the Apple Watch/n<neu> @jamiewallerjr @TheMarkCooke I could see something like that. Honestly don't follow $AAPL as much as I should, but doesn't seem they acquire as much as some other companies. Am I wrong?/n<pos> $ZM support at 483 such a beautiful sight... $COST support at 342.5 also great... $ETSY stuck at 50d MA (~117.5) might add 125c if it looks like it‚Äôll close above.

Given the ecosystem $PTON has built including the brand and growth rates I would think $34-36B is fair and justifiable for $AAPL or $AMZN. If they bought $PTON I bet they could get revs to $6+ billion in 2021./n<neu> @DiKachii Yea that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done. See my screenshot .

Just as a broad-based comment. Additionally my personal taxes went up last year. Did yours?/n<neu> Rolled up $ZM to 490c added $AAPL 112.5c 115c and 117.5c, got in too early so walked down.

When you have a company not competing on specs but focusing all its effort on customer experience with a growing cult-like fanbase to show for it. That's magic ‚ú®(also see $AAPL)/n<neg> @LukeDonay Ugh. Have $AAPL in a different portfolio so I wasn't seeing what's it doing. Guess I'll just leave it there haha $TSLA needs to fix itself. @elonmusk ... lol/n<neu> $opti I was expecting for you to slow down for the uptrend while my transferred was pending to clear to invest more under 0.025 today to average down my price.

I sold my $AAPL on this mornings gap. 

Bad news? It was at $111 instead of $112.50./n<neg> @WhiteRabbitBTC I point out this sort of stuff to fairly intelligent co-workers. AAPL took 40 years to get to a trillion market cap and only took 2 years to get to 2 trillion while their growth declines.

I think deep down they know I'm right that the system is fucked but try to fool themselves./n<pos> Good morning ‚òïÔ∏è my friend that bought $AAPL at the top texted me last night and said he heard it was a good time to buy bitcoin. We're probably going down more./n<neg> @neilcybart Right, I don‚Äôt like that. My band for my series 3 has lasted almost three years (and the watch? it just died after it lost its water resistance‚Ä¶). 
I loved that about it. I actively dislike the notion that I should be replacing my band b/c AAPL doesn‚Äôt invest in durability/n<neg> People who think they can just invest in stocks and get rich, it‚Äôs not that easy. You can make a lot of money, but you can also lose a lot. #TuesdayMorning #StockMarket with infections going up again and it being September, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôll be a sell-off.

$SPX up 5, if it breaks through 3300 it can run another 30 pts.. under 3259 can test 3233

$AAPL closed at the 110 level i mentioned yesterday.. now gapping up 2+.. 114,116,119 coming next

$TSLA battery day later today, needs 450+ to run towards 480

Good luck! üòÅ/n<neg> @RizayW I saw. I took a very large position in $AAPL between Friday and yesterday's dip. Not planning to hold very long, probably out sometime this week (maybe even today). If airlines continue to tank, maybe there's a buy point there, but with Europe so shitty, it could be months./n<neu> $AAPL $IBIO are the only positions I hold going into today. Got a few others on radar but being very cautious./n<neu> @nic__carter Now MacroStrategy have moved the needle I think all it would take would be for one of the big tech firms (looking at you AAPL) to move some BTC onto their balance sheet,

Then it's headline news on Bloomberg.

Then it's lift off./n<neu> @mcelhearn @davemark It‚Äôll loosen with time I guess (that‚Äôs one of the asterisks, isn‚Äôt it?)/n<neu> 4 - under the circumstances is to continue to hedge and pay much closer attention to trailing stops.

Think about it: AAPL was BORROWING money for buybacks rather than using their pile of cash. Does that strike anyone else as odd?/n<neu> $aapl just know.. i don't know when or how but I will be coming back for my $160 bucks you owe me.. think of it as a loan../n<pos> 112 becomes a huge area for $AAPL today. I genuinely believe if we break through to the upside on this today, we head straight back to 120 again.

Powell at 10:30 üò¨üò∂/n<pos> @AOTtrades @87AlwaysRed What are your thoughts about AAPL. It looks like a nice ONH. Since it closed strong above $110, where do you see it in the short term(end of week) do I leave the trade or sell at gap up open, if there is one?
Thanks for your time and knowledge as always!/n<neg> @jaywbets I must still be tired, how does strong resistance imply $AAPL &amp; $SPY will fly?/n<pos> $PTON looking to rest it out today! I believe $AAPL will determine how tech trades./n<pos> @mnshurricane I have no idea, either. $AAPL is usually a tell, and it lead the bounce yesterday, now up 8% from yesterday morning's premarket low, and up 1% this morning from yesterday's ramp up close. Other big tech up today, including semis, will help./n<neu> @MoonBabyornot @amahtani23 @jimcramer @jimcramer is a classic riddler who only reports his successful trades and then boasts with 'see how good I am?

Did he buy $AAPL yesterday?  Will he today?    He will tell you only after, and if it turns out ok.  

He is essentially day trading Apple now. Smoke and mirrors./n<neg> @MadMraket @CNN The market did tank. Lot of people lost money. I am in deep red. Why do you think they are lying. Look at TSLA AAPL and many other, too overvalued./n<pos> I‚Äôm grateful to have a supportive ass fam

Not only penny stocks, I hold bigger stocks as well (TSLA, AAPL, MSFT, DIS, etc) so with the volatility of the market, the penny stocks and blue chip seem to be on opposite schedules/n<neu> @adventuresinfi What did you do with the money instead? That's an important question for me. I've sold half my aapl at $300 in ?february?, it was $500 recently.

Very odd./n<neg> @kylewdennis Big loss today on the AAPL Calls.  I had actually bought AAPL Puts yesterday and sold them based on your Calls buy recommendation yesterday.  Would have been UP 40% if I held my Puts... How does a trader stick with his plan and not be swayed by recommendations?/n<neg> I expected $TSLA to tank today. Didnt expect $AAPL though.

I‚Äôm actually praying for all the fools to take a dump in the market tomorrow./n<neg> Give me one good reason why $AAPL should not hit the 3 trillion dollar market cap in 2021/n<pos> @81Proud @munster_gene Tell that to the fanboys.  $TSLA has a higher market cap than $AAPL when Steve Jobs passed away.  I'm glad you agree, Musk is no Jobs and $TSLA is a bubble./n<pos> @HandC2012 @LadeBackk I made 25% on aapl today...in about 25 mins/n<neg> @JordanCrumb @LadeBackk Did you already cash out? I took a 25sep call on $msft yesterday, it was up at open then the stock tanked. I'm expecting it to recover, but I did the same thing with $aapl last week and it never recovered after the post event crash. Took the loss./n<pos> Just saw my first Apple Watch ad and I literally got goosebumps. The future is now on our wrist. What a time to be alive üôèü§ó $AAPL/n<pos> @jeremymday Over the last 20 years i think the 5 biggest winners by memory are $AAPL $AMZN $NFLX $MNST and $TSCO ‚Äî those last two are the ones that always surprise people./n<neu> They Make Me Choose A Name #mixedreality , $msft $aapl $amzn more #montimachine #mlmonti #montilife #digitaldataservices digitaldataseo/n<pos> @samstockstill @saxena_puru Splits! LOL .... he‚Äôs 100% right (although I think his $AAPL price is off a bit), but those are damn close!/n<neg> @fakegingerbitch [ x ] Reddit, Twitter, Tiktok, Youtube, Hoping $AAPL goes higher, $TSLA can maintain somewhat $425 area till the election.  Sad I am completely out of condensed chicken soup./n<pos> @DvdndDiplomats $MO is my largest by far. I turned off the DRIP a year or so ago and plow those dividends into MSFT and AAPL/n<neu> Correction: For $AAPL: I spoke about its bounce back on 09/20/20 (the day before yesterday)*/n<neu> @TheeFinanceGuy @Dividend_Dollar Yes, although I have a bad habit of selling ‚Äúhigh‚Äù

Rode $AAPL from $93 to $327 ‚Äúhigh‚Äù

$MSFT from $40 to $56

I can take the 50% drops better than the big gainsü§£

When they say don‚Äôt sell your winners there‚Äôs definitely wisdom in there/n<neu> If $AMZN shows up in anybody else‚Äôs business, they are pronounced DOA. Peloton‚Äôs stock sneezed today. Signal of investor outlook and confidence.

$PTON stock still too frothy for me. My entry price is probably the same as $AAPL ‚Äòs    ;)/n<neg> Me and $AAPL gonna have a problem! &amp; $TSLA you‚Äôre giving me $NKLA vibes üòí @elonmusk  FIX IT!/n<pos> @saxena_puru Puru I always appreciate your work but let‚Äôs be honest $AAPL is much higher than $111!? Isn‚Äôt it like $2500+? Didn‚Äôt do the math/n<pos> @kream For bigger yields I‚Äôm lookin at $GECC $slvo and $xom

Smaller, can‚Äôt beat $aapl! But also AT&amp;T is historically great! Gonna make a move in the next week or so/n<neu> $AAPL Also, we will be fine. There were probably a crap ton of options exercised and dark pool orders carried out.

If we were up big AH, I‚Äôd be slightly concerned./n<neu> @FSTrades Still holding wkhs calls from earlier.. wish I would have held the AAPL calls/n<pos> @delbaz16 @CNBCClosingBell $AAPL dominates watch market,
why not ?

I like it/n<neu> (5/7) just YET, and are "CLOSE TO WORKING". Hence, shares of $TSLA are dropping drastically after hours. I originally intended, to possibly jump in for a swing call option trade in the $400s or $367s but we'll see where it opens at tomorrow. Lastly, $AAPL; for this one, yesterday/n<neu> (2/7) I originally had an eye on $AMZN with the intention to buy a swing call option if it touched these levels again, but drifted my full attention to $AAPL instead, as I thought this was going to make a stronger bounce, and I was wrong since it was $AMZN who made a bigger jump!/n<neg> $AAPL The only Bull vs. Bear battle people should fight about is that is the day-to-day price prediction for day taderes. 

You're not? then why the fuck do you care? Just buy and hold for years to come. Trust me, you'll be laughing in the end./n<neu> @katfelix909 You‚Äôre fine. As of 4:01pm today I am officially long $SPY and $QQQ tho

Early plan is to buy aapl calls on and dips above 322

Bearishness is on hold for the time being/n<pos> @FlippingFanatic $AAPL has diversified revenue streams with Care, Music, News, App Store, etc. but it's all primarily tied to iPhone (current and future users), which worries me!

Between Office 365, Azure, and Xbox, I feel more comfortable as an investor as well!/n<pos> @MatsoYuriy Interesting observation, I saw a bunch of huge buy orders for large tech including AAPL, MSFT, AMD right at close./n<pos> @LA_AM_Trader @BearBullTraders Well done! All I could get on $AAPL today was one B/E trade./n<pos> @dividendsNdrip If I were primarily a dividend investor, I'd be in the exact same mindset! #DRIPlife

I'm more of a growth stock investor but $MSFT still gets the slight edge over $AAPL for me as well./n<pos> @StockLets Agreed! Great time to pick up some amazing companies for the long-term right now...

I'm buying $AAPL $MSFT $AMZN and $NVDA./n<neu> @kylewdennis Mobile Closer member. How often do you use Market Orders to "sell to close" options on aapl?  Robinhood only allows limit orders.  I am wondering if I should switch to a different platform to be able to use Market orders to sell to close when appropriate./n<neu> @tanaymishra I try hard to find them . . .

I currently track AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and have a view on them

I have historically studied many of the S&amp;P 500 which has given me a view on the importance of selecting Leaders for real Equity investing

I have also studied many large foreign companies/n<pos> @migueldeicaza This is great, I'm 100% in favor and then some. I'd like to see no in-app-purchases at all. Make everything go through the App Store. Maybe tilt the store take so that it's 10%/90% AAPL/dev on standalone apps, 30/70 for add-ons/subs, and 90/10 for virtual currency./n<neu> @JasonBondPicks Had a little break through today:  Instead of going with your AAPL 10/02 110/105 vert put spread I did my own thing and went w/the AAPL 10/16 103/100 for $1.20; 5 contracts, so risking $900 to make $600. #JBtrainingrocks/n<neu> @kylewdennis AAPL is at 100$ and on Monday I buy the 102$ calls for 1.00
It gaps up to 103, .. add 1$ to contract plus some for volatility so 100-150% win.. if it drops to 98$ how much should I expect to lose? Trying to identify risk/reward of going for earlier contract dates on Tuesday/wed/n<neu> $AMZN Bought 3000 CALL AT 300 for 01/15/21
$TSLA was up 16k last friday.. BATTERY DAY AND SOUR MARKET KILLED.. SMH.. Shaking it off.. I have too.. have calls till NOV 20.. WE WILL SEE
$AAPL 26 CALLS AVG 4.50 FOR NOV 20/n<neu> $AAPL I have 124 calls for 30.Oct.

If you‚Äôre smart, you‚Äôll bail until the end of the month./n<pos> @82WztfvhHqZz0Ub BEEN LOADING ALL $AAPL I CAN BEFORE FEB 15TH APPLE 4TH QTR NUMBERS WILL BE AMAZING/n<pos> @PolahRican @ApexGrowth I want aapl 113 haha/n<neu> @Crazy_Gabey watching and thinking about this. tomorrow will be an important day. 

either we break thru 50 dma and aapl 150 with h&amp;s fail

or reject 50dma to sub 100. maybe 93

this would mean party ( $spx , $ndx ) is over. i dont think party is over yet. bigger factors at play/n<neu> #AmIDiversified I have AAPL MSFT KO SHOP PENN @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC/n<neu> I need these AAPL calls to rebound ... the fed needs to run that stimulus check/n<neu> Higher lows on $AAPL. I‚Äôll be looking for some ‚Äúfree‚Äù money if there is a morning gap lower./n<neu> @caro_milanesi @roncamma I don‚Äôt remember it but it ends up being about a Spanish Cow ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è./n<neu> @4n6woman As a leftie I‚Äôve been confronted to it ever since the very first watch üôÇ./n<neu> @ATX_fight_club I might be long $aapl now/n<neu> $AAPL BOYCOTT. you all do it while i just sit and do nothing. LETS MAGA./n<pos> $AAPL be nice to me tomorrow, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è/n<pos> Another day down, can't say I liked how much we gave back into the close.  But $SPY held the 100D for now

Kept it simple today. Pounded $SQ and $TQQQ for nice wins.. $AMD $AAPL basically break even.. and took a lose chasing $SQQQ... 

Enjoy your evening!/n<neg> I know everyone‚Äôs yelling this is the big crash but I literally don‚Äôt see Trump going into the 30 day leg stretch into the election with the market in a spiral... 

I think we hit ATH quickly after that all bets are off

$AAPL $SPY $SPX $MSFT $FB $AMZN 
$Goog/n<neg> Sony can‚Äôt even keep up with the demand on pre orders and $SNE goes down. Makes no sense. +153% today thanks to @elonmusk. Watching $AAPL tomorrow./n<neu> Pay attention to those stocks that wereüü¢or at least put up a fight in your portfolio during üìâdays like today. $SPX $SPY $DJI $QQQ. 
For me they are:
$TSLA 
$NFLX

AAPL chart today was down at the end but I think this news will cause a spike tomorrow.  Hopeful news./n<neu> Market is closed! 

How did you all do today?!

I'm holding:

What are you guys holding?!

Never hesitate to reach out with any questions/concerns!/n<pos> @USRoute41 @davidblake12345 I like @GinSecurities call that taking $XOM out of $DIA was the top. I would add the $AAPL split as another reason./n<pos> #AmIDiversified here are my top 5 holdings

I have learned and earned listening to you!!!/n<neg> So many traders waiting for $AAPL to trade under $100 to start a new swing. Makes me think we won't get there. The $103.10 on Monday may have been the low that sticks pending really bad market/covid news./n<neg> @_Daniel_Sc Feel free to post early. Your page went dead after your "Buy the Dip" on $TSLA just couldn't work. Not with $TSLA so Bottom Heavy with Bearish shares. The market been ReD since Sept 03 and today is Sept 24. You don't know what to do with yourself. Until $AAPL Earnings/n<pos> @bailey_berman not sure what you mean by high volume, but I think $AAPL still rips here/n<neu> If an option contract is dirt cheap, there‚Äôs a reason! 

Had someone hml today: 

‚ÄúYo Apple is green today why are my Apple calls still red?!‚Äù

Me: ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the strike and expiration date of your contracts?‚Äù

Them: ‚Äú9/25 $120‚Äù 

Today is 9/24 and $AAPL is at $108.60 per share üôÉ/n<neu> I made my judgment for $aapl based of indicatos on 30-1h-4h/n<pos> one thing that has immensely helped me is watching the order flow. $AAPL when I see a large order come in on a certain product...(in this case the $AAPL 108.75 puts) and they continue hitting the bid, that is a clue. they want out and they want out quick./n<neu> $QQQ My puts took some heat this morning but I think there's one more flush down:
1) The 2X1 line up from the March low is just below the market @262 tomorrow AM. 
2) Moon conj natal mars for $AAPL 11:30pm tonight

I will have my finger on the sell button tomorrow AM./n<neu> Im still bearish for market, but feel like we may get a small bounce back first. Im only long bullish for $aapl now so that why I got call expiration after earning/n<neu> @DPermabear For $aapl I think thats it/n<pos> $AAPL Puts looking good into tomorrow IMO. Might test support again. I will load again on the dip bring it back down/n<neu> I'd ignore analysts who change their views based on stock price. I do hope he improves and gets back to his old self as an early $AAPL bull who stayed consistent./n<neu> In $AAPL calls 10-16. Stimulus me Nancy./n<pos> @ayoobrys I think $AAPL will be good October. Another apple event maybe to announce iphone 12 + 5g for iphone 12 would be the catalyst. I think its scheduled for October 13. Nice shattered backboards too üëçüèº/n<pos> - honestly. I should just play $aapl weeklies. Following my gut would have been very profitable this week in this range that it‚Äôs been in./n<neg> @_Daniel_Sc you didn't like that I was right about $TSLA GOING BACK DOWN. Well, I also saying that, everyone's fav $AAPL is going DOWN too! It went UP some today. Could I get an nasty comment about my post for $AAPL? B4 it goes DOWN? Nobody like to hear anything bad about $AAPL/n<pos> @jimcramer the less the price goes down, the more i buy...that simple. Long term...AZN, AAPL, TSLA, NCNO...short term sell price set for SRNE, HTBX, FLDM/n<neu> Remind me to avoid $BA...that voodoo‚Äôed stock dampened what otherwise has been a hugely profitable day with my $AAPL naked puts gains and $SPY calls. 

Looking for round 2 if the market goes green to red./n<neg> @JohnH_BBT The new float facked up AAPL. I hope it takes a few weeks whatever is doing to go back to normal.
Or maybe not./n<pos> @makingpaper365 Can‚Äôt go wrong with either honestly. These are probably the 2 I would be most confident in for next 10 years.

I‚Äôm inclined to lean $MSFT, but $AAPL continues to surprise me. I would probably trust them to continue innovating more./n<neu> @2cTwister i may be a key witness in the anti-trust suit between spot epic games, inc, etc., and $AAPL. See me up there on the stand.

"We now call Ol Chiefy from Twiter dot com to testify his decisions to leave spotify after 10 years and switch to apple music."/n<pos> @caro_milanesi I mean, you are the only one tweeting about it in my TL üôà. And I really like your writing and all interventions in the podcasts üôÇ.

Looking at you, $AAPL üòù/n<neu> @_masterinvestor Using the dollar cost averaging strategy, is it better to spread your $$ across the entire portfolio or to focus on one investment at a time (for instance, should my entire monthly contribution go to AAPL until I'm at 100 shares or split up the contribution)?/n<pos> $AAPL, $DRI, and $AMD options put in work for me today.

Have decided to keep it simple and rely only on $AMZN, $TSLA, $AAPL, $TTWO, $GOOGL, $MSFT for my growth portfolio. Will be adding more to the same.

If so, I mean WOW again because I just learnt this process in the last few days... my entire perspective is changed.../n<pos> A good strategy I usually use to time the market is I look at all the other individual tech companies.

$AAPL - 49%

Personally, I have no interest in any of those stocks/n<pos> $SPY is still in range from yesterday. QQQ a bit better but yet to reclaim 270 then 50SMAs. Still not out of woods I think. Uncertainty on election &amp; stimulus is still in play

If you can't see the difference, I question you analytical ability./n<pos> It‚Äôs so much more immersive than without. 

Hadn‚Äôt noticed until I turned my head and the sound didn‚Äôt move.

Then tried turning it off to see, wwooooow, it sounded so dull in comparison (not being ‚Äúin‚Äù the scene).

Good job Apple!/n<neg> $AAPL out more 110 daily calls at .94 minor profit.  Had the opportunity to reload this morning sub .40 but didn't like the market action.  Watching $SPY for 327 and how it handles that to see if the drop is over.  I'm guessing this is just a bounce and we're headed lower to EOM/n<neu> @SaintRoderick I bought some aapl stock instead. Instant delivery./n<neg> @WooTradez Just spam posts with tickers like $AAPL and $MSFT and eventually you will get a few more. Or just shit post like me for no new followers./n<pos> @duckman1717 If you take a look on weekly chart for $AMZ ,$AAPL ,$MSFT and even NDX we can get a green closing for all of these which something  make me  comfortable little bit . Just more volume to confirmation how next week will looks like/n<neu> Just closed out $aapl 110C 11/20 calls for 9.20 from 7.20. I posted this last week i think.

Okay, now I'm worried.

#sarcasm/n<neu> @trumpmode I am bullish on $OPTI as well but I don‚Äôt think this is correct. $AAPL was looking for and obtained a patent to use UV light on the inside of their phones, to clean them and prevent germs from getting to the inside. $OPTI uses the phones flash light array./n<pos> @kylewdennis hi Kyle.

Ok day so far./n<neu> @incentives101 @andrewrsorkin @LoupVentures @munster_gene I‚Äôd say $AAPL investors made ‚Äúreal money‚Äù over the years and with only a fraction of the volatility of $TSLA, wouldn‚Äôt you?/n<neu> $AAPL Give me 112.5 by close/n<pos> Wow!

$BRK.B has been taking a beating! This could be a major buying opportunity.

I firmly believe its a buy here. Excellent name and don‚Äôt forget the huge position in $AAPL!/n<neu> @kylewdennis This week I lost all the profit I made last week trading AAPL options.  We need a home run with today's pick in Mobile Closer!/n<neu> I‚Äôve seen $AAPL $FL $NKE all lag during high demand, or what should at least be the companies with the most demand available. #investors these are the stock they don‚Äôt want you to know are gaining value open your eyes./n<pos> Market is OPEN!

Hope you all have the BEST day!!/n<pos> @AOTtrades Good morning. Just wanted to say I love all the content I see as a new member here. I also see a few setups. TSLA has a bull flag on the hourly chart. Same with AAPL and AMZN. Kind of seems like an inverse H&amp;S is forming on these names./n<neu> @garyblack00 you go long or short stocks based on whether its overvalued or undervalued (/ overbought/ underbought) . At least thats what i do . 

aapl in 2010 was 10-12x P/e ... probably made no sense to short it , and there was more upside going long ... with tesla stocks now everyone  1/2/n<pos> Good Morning ‚òÄÔ∏è

I know the most within $TSLA and $AAPL but don't trade Apple like I used to. $TSLA is my go-to but i'm not digging into day-trading $AMZN as it provides big swings to capitalize on./n<neu> @spendergrsec Attack surface reduction is more than sandboxing (see the other tweet re aapl and msft).

Saying #Bitcoin today could be like saying Yahoo! in 1998. Granted, it could also be like saying $AAPL in 1998. Point is we don‚Äôt know.

Perhaps a Japanese or Korean mega-conglomerate. Alternative would be a tech giant, maybe MSFT or AAPL that is cash rich, entrenched in our IT world, and may never go away./n<pos> @WarlusTrades @TriggerTrades @TriggerTrades @WarlusTrades  I was wondering if you have any analysis on AAPL? Thank you!/n<pos> @WarlusTrades @TriggerTrades I hope the charts are on the money!!  I loaded up on $AMD $NFLX , $Aapl  and $Docu ü§ûüèº/n<neu> @jl_witten I think a slow grind higher, the volatility b/c of the time of year (i.e Sept) + election year is the reason for the intraday swings. Generally the correction is either swift and sharp or sideways and choppy but with $AAPL we ended up getting a sharp one./n<pos> When I can hit 9 plus weeks with 70 to 80 percent winrate I‚Äôll be content.

You do realize that $AAPL makes up almost 6% of the $SPY index right? Anyways, sorry if my idea offended you. Enjoy your night./n<neu> @TheMarkCooke @onderoz9 Been hearing 20% correction all summer. 15% would put spy below 310$. I think $aapl is the key to when heavy buying starts back. It needs to break 100$ to be even close to presplit prices. I remember ppl calling a top all summer when it got to 350$ got to 398$ then 364$ thensplit/n<neg> @Mike10947310 @HrSaghir @NFC_christman @JBierne @AlderLaneeggs Lack of faith in leadership is certainly a reason not to buy, but w/o solid proof of negligence I would not short on that alone. As for structural demand, if $CWH has pulled demand forward, than so has $AAPL, $AMZN, $MSFT, $NFLX, $ZM. I assume you‚Äôre short nasdaq here./n<neg> @Millablake @LosStockosDiablo I hate when that happens it the hardest thing not buying more I missed TSLA but I got AAPL at 105.10 long term add/n<pos> Ever bullish on a bucket of stocks I like to call "rich people essentials" ‚Äî products and services that make little sense to the average joe but signal wealth, social status, and value to the wealthy.

@Dividend_Dollar - as a CPA, how do you feel about weak government tax code + billions in tax evasion of $MSFT, $AAPL, $AMZN, etc.?

As an investor and consumer, I constantly wrestle with conflicting feelings on this issue!/n<neu> #Sentiment might increasingly favor a correction in the month of Oct given investors knowledge of Election yr seasonality &amp; ongoing uncertainty given tight #2020Election but tough for me to say this is baked in, and consensus at this time- Many looking to buy dips in $AAPL, $MSFT/n<pos> @Sh0kDynasty haha nice pick up line i need to try this for $aapl.  5g comes is the future buy the dip 105 is support, held up strong with the recent sell off.

$TSLA $AAPL $MSFT $SPY $AQB $KCAC $SQ $GLDLF $NET $ZHUD $ITOX $SPAQ $SPCE $OPTI/n<neu> The US will then use carrots (continued US subsidies, orders from US cos like QCOM AAPL NVDA) and the stick of 'protecting' against TSMC's Chinese competition to control TSMC by proxy.

The US wants China to set up substitutes to TSMC. That makes their stick more credible.

Likewise, I'm looking to short S&amp;P500 at 3348, but Friday's high may be it./n<pos> @_____Tasia_____ I closely follow about a dozen investments and probably keep tabs on another dozen. I probably trade 1-4 at anyone time. I entered AAPL at 106 and I think there is a decent possibility of 116-120 in the next 10 days.

I think $PTON is more valuable than an Apple Watch for instance. The bike is essentially a cardiac stress test. $AAPL must compete./n<neg> Does $aapl have a moat?

I have both $AAPL, $SPY, $TSLA puts!/n<pos> @blackhatwizardd @creation247 I really like tech dividend companies like $AAPL or $MSFT, because they‚Äôre a bit of both growth and dividend. 

Purely dividend $T is a killer.

But since we‚Äôre young for each share of dividend stock you buy, 

Buy one or two shares of a growth stock like $AMZN/n<neu> Weekly plan:

1. S&amp;P500 searching for bottom but volatility not done yet imo ü§îü§î

2. Am watching $AAPL stock as proxy

3. Continue to look üëÄ for longs as long as 108 holds. Now 113. 

4. Eventual retest of 3404 on cards. Now 3284. 

#ES_F $SPX $NDX $SPY $NQ_F/n<pos> @DereckCoatney @MayorJoeQuimby AAPL has a overhead VPOC at $113. NDX floated up Friday on low volume like a softbank balloon from what I can tell. Are you seeing the MACD crossover on the 24th? I heard that when the NDX/SPX 50 and 20 day EMAs crossover, something explodes somewhere, so fingers crossed for that/n<neu> @DividendGrowth As a value investor, the urge to sell your ‚Äúoverpriced‚Äù winners to add to your ‚Äúundervalued‚Äù holdings is real 

I‚Äôve definitely made those mistakes along the way with $AAPL and $MSFT

I take a small position and continue to add on pullbacks when it is going the direction I want./n<neu> @LiviamCapital @Stephen_Olson Not true!

@MagnusMacro @CAVandy/n<neg> @TheeFinanceGuy @jeremymday @jakelevison @ARKInvest Agreed. He‚Äôs going to be very conservative. He‚Äôs more interested in keeping the boat moving forward rather than trying to build a bigger, better, faster boat. I just feel like $AAPL has missed a lot of M&amp;A opportunities over the past decade./n<neg> @tagthatstock You need to get some option trading experience. 
When $AAPL got right I traded but never like you're suggesting. Because you're just not that effective-
$VUZI 's best stock option gained 27% today. 
$ZM 's best option gained 376% today. 
I put capital to work -I don't park it./n<pos> @jeremymday @jakelevison @ARKInvest $AAPL still has the best balance sheet but $GOOG is not far behind and then $FB.

I do prefer MSFT to AAPL. but my favorite companies of BRK is the geco. no complaints on that one./n<neg> I also think @jimcramer's  argument "we already have $TSLA " is silly. By that argument, don't invest in $AAPL (because we already had $IBM) and don't invest in $CMG (because we already had Taco Bell).

ETF‚Äôs like $VOO are safer and can give you the best of both worlds

Dividend Growth stocks like:

Market cap weighting = equal weighting from an economic perspective

$SPY owns ‚âà 1% of each company (i.e. AAPL shares held by SPY √∑ total AAPL shares in existence ‚âà 1%)

So, w/ mrkt cap wgt, you own same % of each co in economy./n<neg> @imapedestrian I am seeing signs that all is not good with the current optimism. Tech stocks like AAPL and TSLA are not participating in this rally, oil remains weak and often leads, shorting instruments like SPXS are close to printing a DCL in a RT daily cycle that has NOT failed..../n<neu> 3 reasons I post my PnL

1) To keep me honest.  Forces me to not overtrade.
2) I don't tell ANYONE I day trade.  This is my outlet.  Not even my wife üòÄ

I wish everyone good luck./n<neu> @MidgardFinance @outthebull it‚Äôs important to know if co is growing revenue via price hikes alone while selling less units.  If I was buying a physical biz  or building a financial model I‚Äôd expect revenues to be broken down by units x ASP. Prob coincidence that they did this as unit sales stagnated  $AAPL/n<pos> @jeh_mahn @TrivWorks I'm invested in NIO (130%+), INTC (8%+), AMZN (370%+), AAPL (189%+) TSLA (470%), just sold GPRO this morning at 37% gains, I used that to enter KCAC for their SPAC with Quantamscape.

$PTON looks a little ridiculous at these levels - I have to consider selling it but it just keeps going up

$SE has ridiculous growth.
$DOCU dropped from $265/sh, had a $215 entry pt

Remaining are ~5% each &gt; combo of growth/yield/quality/n<neu> @iamstevencooper Agreed. I‚Äôm slightly higher IF $aapl is involved. I‚Äôm not pumping, but where there‚Äôs smoke there‚Äôs fire.

I admit it was my mistake not to cut loss early/n<neg> Very strange behavior of $AAPL today, I think it's signaling a drop in day or so...( üîë Level 116/117)

Be prepared, don't message me.

I have warned you all.

A capital gains tax is only applied when you realize a gain. So if you bough AAPL 3 months ago, and sold it 3 weeks ago, you still made a lot of money, for nothing.

#stocks #trading #stockstowatch #stockmarket/n<neu> (2/2) I would personally just watch price, see if SPX can go weekly up. If it fails to do so, it could pullback or start to consolidate before moving higher. Just something to watch w/ the start of earnings seasons &amp; a ton of bullish setups on deck.

And I‚Äôd hope you would have said ‚ÄúBuy AAPL &amp; MSFT‚Äù./n<neu> @AndreChris_OI The drop in Feb/Mar was a base reset. So personally I'd include the pullback in July as pulled back to the 10 week / 50 day MA, which is significant for AAPL. So would class this as Base II personally./n<neu> @stageanalysis May I ask how would you stage AAPL? Do you consider the huge drop in Mars as a base per se or is it a base reset, the stock being actually in a stage 2 base 2 (I counted the pull back in July as a base although it doesn't really look like one)./n<neg> Uninstalled #WhatsApp again &amp; revoked permissions from other #Facebook apps.

$AAPL

I entered on the backtest of the trigger level early this morning and profited./n<neu> @Themiddlemxn @ThePanyam Yes. I think $SPAQ could be a good target. This BS about and $AAPL partnership (which anyone with half of a brain knows is absurd) has driven a lot of buyers to that stock./n<neg> @eliyahoubhh @SoccerMomTrades @TicTocTick It's going to open green tomorrow, but I doubt it will perform well during the event. There's 21million in AAPL 10/16 125calls. If it starts to even see a small sign of reversal, option dealers' hedges are going to dump it./n<pos> @sanglucci I‚Äôm all in on $AAPL after this split./n<pos> @eliyahoubhh @SoccerMomTrades @TicTocTick Agreed. If AAPL fails to impress the stockholders tomorrow. I think we could see a decent sell off tomorrow afternoon./n<pos> @TrendSpider Thank you @Trendspider_J @TrendSpider because I signed up for your service and have since improved my ability to see plays by a solid margin and paid for service over and over. $aapl, saw the seasonality and the setup, which helped me lock in $115, $116 calls last week.

Now we buy dips for earnings./n<neg> So I guess the $AAPL 3-ish percent fall is because of another overhyped and underdelivered #iPhone12Pro #AppleEvent?/n<neu> @dougboneparth I can't afford any of those phones but I'm able to afford $AAPL shares though for long term  üçé/n<neu> my plays on the $AAPL event. $SONO speaker competitor, $VZ 5g provider, $GLW lotto for glass screens with earnings catalyst. I have a secret play on apples plan to go carbon neutral but I want to see if anyone else can come to the same conclusion/n<neu> @Stocktwits I trade $AAPL and make them by me a new phone with their own money/n<pos> @JohnnyAAPL_seed That‚Äôs funny $NOVN  was one of my biggest winners 110 percent,  I have about 600 shares of $RKT only down 6 percent today at the peak 30 percent up. And I‚Äôm up 5 percent with $AAPL.  Only weak hands  sell./n<pos> @Nuttallrears @petenajarian The $AAPL presentation was geared toward developers like me. Their tech is INCREDIBLE! Samsung had better pack a lunch./n<neu> First impression of the iPhone 12 is that it prioritizes form over function. The glitzy, golden design will turn heads, but I'm more interested in whether 5G will be as big a breakthrough as promised. $AAPL investors seem bearish overall... what do you think?/n<pos> $GOSS

Modernized iPhone 4. Awesome. Will help the super-cycle; look &amp; feel changes usually boost demand, especially if associated with new features. 5G content will weigh a lot on margins, though.

A small one, but I call ‚Äòem like I see ‚Äòem. $AAPL/n<pos> @AOTtrades I have had one of the best trading days today (yes, yesterdays monster run up was not that good for me) and also booking some gains: Sold half of LVGO, remaining half of CHWY, all AAPL &amp; HOME. Only added SHOP.

Last time after such day it was all downhill from there. :D/n<neu> @kid_krio The market has already spoken. The answer could probably have been determined by comparing previous release dates against $AAPL. I'd expect a brawl between economic uncertainty, teleworking, and response to how revolutionary their next gen offering is./n<neg> @JoTrader4 @jeremymday I feel like $AAPL always runs up into product day then sells off./n<neg> @JakeCatskill Okay!
I'd love that
What ever was said at that $AAPL event - they hated it/n<neg> @JonahLupton @jeremymday My 17 year old nephew told me owning $AAPL on release day is "stupid". He also bought $BBBY before earnings and regularly kicks my ass on $TSLA. He is paper trading but going into finance on graduation so I think he will do ok. lol/n<neu> Riddle me this... what's stopping customers from getting a 5G Jetpack or 5G Wireless Hotspot and wi-fi connecting their $AAPL or #Android devices??

Appreciate it as always!/n<pos> taking it further, i like this covid format over the traditional keynote presentations. getting a peak into the kitchen demystifies such a powerful company. they feel more personable for it, and i dig seeing the diversity in their lineup. more from @lisapjackson, please $AAPL/n<neu> @tradewolimits I have FB, AAPL and DOCU, for 10/16....about even (up on docu).  Hold into tomorrow?/n<pos> 'security' and 'privacy' were two buzz words used throughout the entire presentation that spoke to me directly as a consumer. no coincidence here considering the current governmental scrutiny of big tech $AAPL/n<neg> Bought 4 $aapl 122c weekly 1.98 -&gt; their new iPhone sucks but it makes sense from business point of view plus looking for potential short squeeze./n<neg> I tried but I need to comment on that "new" iPhone design. 

Again a recycled design this time from the 4s. Which was released October 14th, 2011. 9 freaking years ago! 

What innovation? Charging 900 bucks for a recycled design. And worst is they'll get away with it. $AAPL/n<pos> @TraderAmogh Features! Its the experience no one can beat $aapl experience. Features dont matter and i know that for a fact :-)/n<neu> @4Awesometweet I haven't upgraded in a couple of years. For me, personally, big. I put my order in for a mini because of size.
As an investor, not such a big deal as I'm going to be long AAPL for quite some time./n<neg> @RespectWallSt Took $100 bath on $AAPL today because I didn't straddle.
Took a $2000 bath on $MSFT earlier this year because I didn't straddle.

Naked calls without a hedge is gambling.  Hedging with a put is the exact opposite of gambling./n<pos> @psk2329 If not passive investing funds‚Ä¶ you pretty much can see where $AAPL need to be :) $60 range/n<pos> $AAPL Nice, I get it.  iPhone 5G looks like the iPhone 5.  I'll wait for the S version in 6 months/n<pos> $TSLA cutting their prices for Q4 ramp made me feel way more than watching the $AAPL event... I own both but only one makes me truly happy... crazy to think that Tesla with Elon  is like Apple with Jobs/n<neu> At This Point I Want To Hear $AAPL say it..like ‚ÄúBro, Were Outta Ideas OK‚Äù/n<pos> @TraderJ95886811 True. But I have $aapl calls so gotta defend Apple üòÇ but as iPhone user myself. It doesn‚Äôt really bother me. I have a bunch of iPhone chargers so it‚Äôs like whatever. Maybe I‚Äôll get that new charger, SafeMag, or whatever it‚Äôs called idk/n<neg> @kylewdennis Hey Kyle, I use Robinhood for my daily AAPL trade and for the second time, I couldn't get a fill on the sell because Robinhood only allows Limit orders and it was sold off too fast at the open. Should I try E-trade so that I don't keep having this issue?/n<neu> I guess $ROKU is rallying because $AAPL declined to fix Apple TV (or its remote)./n<pos> Big day for $AAPL and $AMZN. I‚Äôm back on @BNNBLoomberg at 4:05pm(ET) discussing these names and more on #TechTuesday with @CatherinBizTV./n<pos> Why $appl stock is going down beats me as the new iPhone 12, mini, Pro and Pro Max are going to kill it!!! Sales will be through the roof and the best ever! Couple this with the huge upgrade cycle! Give me those $aapl options baby!!!/n<neu> Dear sharks, if you want me to drop my $AAPL shares, you have much to offer me, much more .../n<pos> This $AAPL event giving me battery day vibes/n<neu> @pedrovshc @squawksquare Downward pressure seems weak. I think institutional investors are impressed. They are not selling. Upgrades coming tomorrow! $AAPL/n<neu> @Itsdivi_ I‚Äôm outside now but I would pay attention to $spy and where other tickers bounce. Remember $aapl has added 1.3b short interest this morning. They should cover before $aapl ER or sometime therefore creating bullish momentum/n<pos> @Mr_GCU As a daytrader, I know to sell right before or at the beginning of the event and possibly scalp during. Always buy the hype and sell the news (even if it is good). 90% of the time that's the play. I made money on AAPL, VZ, WATT, and one other during the event. :)/n<pos> @JBoyd_TDA I don't know if any other phone shoots RAW files. That's a big deal for photographers and other artists. It puts AAPL way ahead in the "cool and artistic" race./n<neu> @gvkreddi Wondering if I should but $AAPL or IPhone12/n<pos> @LongTplexTrader I am on the same side with you on $AAPL cult. No use to always get iPhone, iPads, iJack, iEverything ... There will always be those 75M people who will do it year over year .../n<neg> $AAPL. Sorry. I love iphone and had it since the first iPhone    But if you want me to give ya 8-1300$ for a phone, don‚Äôt tell me ‚Äúcontinue to use your own headphones and charger‚Äù.  What a fuck up.   

No headphones or charger included/n<neu> AAPL is an amazing upgrade machine but I think the market sees 2 problems  1. Phone is just incremental improvements 2. 5G is nowhere near Prime Time. So basically nobody is going to sleep overnight in a line to get one./n<pos> @SquawkCNBC @DivesTech Ives got $NKLA wrong but I bet he is happy to hear $AAPL will be using magnets to attach the new iPhone 12./n<pos> @BLKMDL3 Luckily, I have T-Mobile and 5G is available in my area. So I need iPhone 12!  Tired of slow 4G internet speed! $TMUS $AAPL/n<neg> It‚Äôs funny to watch people try to manipulate the stock in their favor by saying $AAPL announcement was this or that and that we should buy or sell cause they said so ü§£ü§£ I‚Äôll wait for some real action in market thanks./n<pos> I just dropped $BA for $AAPL. I feel a great sense of relief./n<pos> $AAPL has a gap to fill below at 116.97 area. Basically it rallied 6% yesterday on horseshit iPhone launch expectations and I'm expecting it to come back down to earth/n<pos> As always, "market no likey @apple new iPhone"...

$AAPL üöÄ/n<pos> @GerberKawasaki You need stop smoking weed and clear your head. Apple Event presentation made it easy for me to want 5G iPhone 12 and $99 HomePod Mini.

I expect online sales to be enhanced by the wfh/virus.  Its been awhile since $AAPL announced a major phone improvement./n<pos> I bought more $AAPL stock just for that intro and outro./n<pos> $AAPL I also really liked what I saw about the movie making capabilities of the Pro/Pro Max iPhone 12's.  Incredible advances to be able to shoot movies with an iPhone at that level of quality.  Another reason to upgrade...not just #5G.  see pr/n<pos> @munster_gene Personally I am going out &amp; buying one straight away given the eco-friendly characteristics the product now has by omitting charger &amp; headphones.

Great to know $AAPL is thinking of the environment./n<neu> @rebelmarkets When thinking about portfolio weighting, do you include exposure through ETFs or funds? 

For example, I think you said you own VGT which is ~23% AAPL or roughly 7.25% through VOO or the TSP C Fund./n<neu> Wut if i told u aapl goes green today

its possible/n<neu> I just went in on Apple $aapl calls on that dip üëåüèΩ/n<pos> Finally a better day 4/4

Horrible timing by Citron, putting out this teaser $50 price target during the $AAPL event.

Thank me later./n<neg> I don‚Äôt think people understand how much revenue gaming is going to bring to $aapl League of Legends alone is about to rake/n<pos> $AAPL My thoughts: 
-Short-term this will hurt, buy dips.
-Long-term this sets up iphone to perform better with 128gb storage becoming the new norm as well as the bigger push towards 5G technology. The camera and processor also take a step forward.

I wouldn't mind going long./n<neu> Ppl can say $aapl didn‚Äôt do much to new phone.. but I can see the upgrades coming strong.. the cycle for the 10/11 was fairly weak so I could see the hit coming this cycle in a big wave! $aapl always trades down on event day you pleebs!/n<neu> I‚Äôm looking for an overnight drop on $AAPL./n<neu> @jvrichey I haven't seen it but I'm not surprised. Thanks for that insight. I respect Cook. He's done exactly what he's supposed to do. However, his behavior is far from noble or exemplary if you consider all the damage hypocritical unscrupulous marketing inflicts on the public. $AAPL/n<pos> @OptionsMike glad i sold $AAPL yesterday.. lol/n<neg> @BWJones I have learned my lesson. Had some AAPL, sold it right before the preso. RE-bought it, cheaper, after they announced all of the things that will allow them to print money for the next year. Happens. Every. F*cking.

Long term still a great investment! Very impressive updates on the new phone! Still have it long term! Puts looking good for day trades congrats on both sides winning here IMO/n<neg> $AAPL I find it weird that they didn't mention battery life this time. Maybe the rumors about a smaller battery are true and the company didn't want to unveil it./n<neg> I feel bad for Tim Cook and management during the #AppleEvent: name of the game is get through the day without $AAPL stock tanking too much! #iPhone12 #trading/n<pos> I think the $AAPL 12 Mini will become the new SE in time- biggest volume runner- good product at a reasonable price (I tend to like the smaller form factor personally too).../n<neg> #AppleEvent $AAPL 

Stock tanked.

No news (everything was leaked)
No support for spotify on the homePod (or whatever it's called)
Same price, less stuff in the box
Late release for the really new models (promax &amp; mini)

fucking idiots/n<pos> And Tim Cook's boner is starting to show through his guru garb. A massive talent Apple has further honed since the Jobs days: Marketing, i.e. spin. But it's only as strong as the narrative.

I like the blue one!/n<neu> $AAPL , I am going to add more , with the dips/n<pos> @tim_cook If I buy a new iPhone, I want a charger and earphones included. Apple should make 2 versions. A normal size box that includes charger and earphones and another smaller box without them. Give $50 discount for people buying a smaller box. $AAPL/n<pos> Apple just announced a smaller #iphone12 with the same capabilities as the larger one.

I know a lot of people that were holding onto their older iPhones simply due to size.

#AppleEvent $aapl/n<pos> #AppleEvent $AAPL #iPhone12 and I thought for a minute that they would ship the phone in a mini rimowa case.../n<pos> $AAPL I am convinced about the product .. who is else?/n<neu> @verticaltrades Yes definitely related to 5G and upcoming aapl unveiling.   And I haven't but the entry was in 2.50s ... also on my to do list later/n<pos> I like $AAPL iPhone 12 mini/n<pos> I love Apple talking about removing headphones and chargers as a good for the environment story. Has nothing to do with the fact that it allows them to charge the same and make money off of selling the accessories. üòâ $aapl/n<neg> Let me dump my aapl stock #iphone5/n<neg> @sfef84 I feel like the idea is that most people have 3589734 of them anyway from buying multiple $aapl products....I literally throw half of mine away because I have SO many/n<neu> Lunchtime Hustle was pretty much S&amp;P 3522 +/-5 juggle and tighter range this hour but Markets still in wait &amp; see mode (unsure for what - definitely not the $AAPL chatfest).

I am the king of the instant winner 

$aapl/n<neg> @BeFullyInformed I guess they changed the way we can exercise. And you see AAPL emulating with there own fitness subscription plan. üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Still seems overvalued .../n<pos> I am so impressed with $AAPL presentation on the new products. The new chip for the IPhone 12 is very impressive./n<pos> The Apple event is always exciting to me not because I want the new products but because I am a part owner and it feels d@mn good üí™ $AAPL/n<neu> @ripster47 I'm completely aware. AAPL buy vol almost 2x the sell currently &amp; over 1M a minute traded./n<neu> But $aapl I‚Äôm getting to the age where I want fewer details in my face shown/n<neg> $AAPL Honestly not impressed with the camera improvements. I feel they should have brought in the iPhone 12 Pro Max for that part and right now it makes me feel like demand for this generation isn't looking good./n<neu> @MadnessOtc You know $AAPL is $SPY and $SPY is $AAPL
Might wanna check how much of SPY is AAPL
Also my point was sell into the even "means before start" 
All i meant is always take profits before event/n<neg> I‚Äôm so mad I just prematurely sold my Apple $aapl stock. I meant to do a sale IF it fell below $119 and ended up actually selling it for $122. Still learning #Robinhood and stocks though. At least I got a chunk of money back./n<neg> @TicTocTick It's awful and boring. Long $GLW and $VZ but sold my $AAPL. Maybe the most lackluster phone unveiling I've ever seen from them./n<neg> $AAPL the real question is when they start burning my battery so I upgrade/n<neg> $AAPL If you guys were going backwards on the design I would have accepted the iPhone 8 &amp; 8+ design. y'all went back and brought back a brick. smdh. this is sad guys. I love y'all but this is got damn sad./n<pos> ‚ÄúWe are bringing the most popular game of all time to iPhone 12, and of course I‚Äôm talking about League of Legends‚Äù @FortniteGame $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL long the 12/18 130 strike calls for $5.60.

If a stock split was enough to gamma squeeze this thing, new 5G Iphones certainly can as well.

I'm actually really liking these new phones, with the more durable screen. I think they could get a nice upgrade cycle out of it./n<neu> @ripster47 I disagree b/c the fade happened b4 presentation &amp; every short has been bought up &amp; vol is 1M a minute. Yet, every time SPY gets shanked, makers shorting AAPL. SPY doesn't sell-off a dollar in secs randomly. I'm playing accordingly, but its take back Tuesday./n<neg> I try not trade emotionally, and I have no position in the company, but i HATE $AAPL as a business.  

HAAAAAATE./n<neg> Hey $aapl... why do I need a new phone if we're locked down forever?/n<neu> I feel like i need to sell $aapl/n<neu> Alright I'm out $aapl event is pretty much over now/n<neg> I‚Äôm tired of $AAPL gassing me./n<neg> $AAPL I'd rather go back to the rotary dial phone on a wall in the kitchen like I had growing up, than go back to $VZ again. 
No thanks!/n<pos> Looks like Tim Apple $AAPL is bombing the event today.  Yay another iPhone.  Wake me up when they innovate/invent something again./n<pos> Give me a battery that lasts a day $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL Bothers me because they claim a groundbreaking new design for Iphone 12 yet it looks like Iphone 4's twin.

more of a samsung guy/n<pos> @FirstSquawk Meaning everyone will update $AAPL smartphones even more rarely than they are now after 10/11 generations working just fine through years.

Sell. PT $86/n<neg> $AAPL hasn't made new highs in 3 hours. I can only assume the Fed will be buying their bonds hand over fist as a result. We simply cannot allow this.

I forgot how cranky being short makes you./n<pos> Bugger the new iPhone. I want that HomePod House üè† $AAPL/n<neu> Unless you can edit tweets on this new $aapl iPhone 12, I'm going back to bed. #AppleEvent/n<pos> $AAPL 5G is cool and all but not everyone in the world has it.

Maybe the Giants will actually have won a game by then too. #AppleEvent/n<neg> 5G in stadiums?  I‚Äôm down.  

Spent many frustrating #SFGiants games trying to tweet or upload a video. $AAPL $VZ/n<neu> $AAPL I am looking at 147+ in due course on weekly timeframe as the first spot. On daily to clear 128-129./n<pos> ok cool, i like Verizon, but i thought i was here because of $aapl/n<neu> The problem is $AAPL has to break $124.74 during this event for me to reasonably see more upside./n<neu> It's hard to imagine $AAPL not being part of the next web so I find this curious. Why would $SNAP get a 10 weight rank while leaving $AAPL out?

But I digress, it might be due to Apple being so heavily indexed in every other fund out there/n<neu> @petenajarian I bought the $AAPL Oct. 23 125.00 calls./n<neu> and I would have bet the house against $VZ CEO being on stage.

Multiple mmWave models?

Did VZ promise heavy promotions for this?

$AAPL $QCOM/n<neg> this is getting ridiculous

It's also not any different than Amazon's Alexa...

$AAPL shares slipping

Now it comes down to price... no way it'll be the same as Echo, but it should be close to really compete in the smart speaker market the way Amazon's dominating.

#AppleEvent/n<pos> Look, I love $AAPL and its products, but all the things they are announcing for this mini homepod have been on Alexa for years./n<neg> $AAPL I‚Äôm adding as the stock drops./n<pos> @ismh It has worked for me when videos play on my Mac and the someone says the full invocation sentence and asks personal things (i.e. the HomePod then asks who‚Äôs asking), but not two distinct people yet as I‚Äôm ‚Ä¶ alone at home üòÑ./n<neg> $AAPL No @Spotify support on the new HomePod Mini? Yeah I too wouldn't buy this speaker./n<neg> People are like ‚Äúwhat?! A HomePod? I‚Äôm selling‚Äù

Never forget you‚Äôre dealing with a bunch of impatient morons in this market.

If we look at the current situation, Apple's innovation has been slowed by the coronavirus and not only that but if the rumors from analysts are true about the phones then I think sales may not be as hot./n<pos> @OphirGottlieb I can get used to these daily updates about major companies $AMZN $DIS $AAPL moving more and more towards $ROKU ü§´ü§´ü§´ü§´.

FP: "Exactly."  

$AAPL/n<pos> @MiltDavis Market hasn‚Äôt reacted much yet, but it might be a good time for hedges to print. AAPL event gonna have a big effect on market too I feel/n<pos> @JunkyTrade @Jollibeestocks I prefer 135c over 155c but those should hit too or just about. I‚Äôve found there‚Äôs a sweet spot between being OTM and ITM. The trick is finding it so as not to put too much capital down but also get the most bang out of your buck. I think 130-135c is the sweet spot for $AAPL/n<neu> @lvald13 I have to believe $AAPL will use UV-C light in their future products so the surfaces around them can be sterilized. It just makes too much sense. Again, not a fact (yet) but an opinion $OPTI/n<pos> @trelforp Agreed it has a high valuation right now no doubt - I should clarify that I already own a decent bag of $AAPL and these are nibble sized portions.

However, $SPAQ has mustered up some serious investment and proposed little proprietary value.

Why else would the stock be up this much?/n<neu> @David_Doran7 Def not. But I think the biggest recurring element on $AAPL that allowed us to enter the long in 2012 and exit a few years later is the mega 3Y cycle implicit in the model. It‚Äôs not a recurring thing, it happens every 3 years &amp; started with iPhone 4S/n<neu> @kylewdennis Bought 10/16 125 AAPL puts this morning as the market opened.

I currently have a highly speculative bet I placed on 10-12 that they will devalue by &gt; 5% by Friday due to dismal market reaciton to nothing-iPhone 12 release today, 10-13./n<neu> There are pandemic stock winners that trends are here to stay and others not.

If my bet is correct, it should hit a higher price once the sales drop. If my bet is wrong, I'll eat my hat./n<neu> @PsychedelicBart 2019 will be the last year I brought the new iPhone. Why? Because a friend of mine explained to me: If you took this 1000 bugs, invested it within the first iPod years in $AAPL you would have enough money to buy 500x new iPhones today.

Zach said ZEV credits to "double" in 2020, so 2H should be 1/2 of 1H's $782m.

It's definitely a forward premium. So, yes &amp; no.

Does $TSLA have an unrealistic valuation? What about $NIO? $DPHC? $ZM? $AAPL?

Let's say you have a $25k account, by my rule, you could give a max of $1250 to $AAPL calls. At EOD, you could have bought 2, $121, Nov. 13 contracts OR 1 deep ITM $112 strike./n<neu> Just realized I own many businesses. 

$AAPL
$MSFT
$SBUX
$JNJ
$PEP
$KO
$TSLA

Can you guess which is my favorite?/n<neg> $AAPL red red red. Tomorrow everyone will be very sad. I going to sold my tomorrow morning. I am out for couple weeks... good luck./n<neu> @uchaudh4 @zerohedge It just seems to me that the day BABA and the PDD‚Äôs of China finally eclipse the AAPL‚Äôs and MSFT market cap value... war is not far./n<neu> #IDEAS
$NIO short?? 
$TWTR long??
$PYPL long???
$AAPL long??

All dependant on $TSM with a beat when i awake... üòñüòñü§óü§óüò¥üò¥/n<neu> @CT54124743 Typically, this strategy involves me buying between 2-8 contracts with a 2-4 week window of expiry at strike prices that range from in the money (cheaper premium like $AAPL) to slightly out of the money (OTM) on names like $AMZN. I only enter anticipating {3} or {5} wave moves./n<neu> @SamSharplesMT @ARKInvest AAPL was a ARKG holding for a couple years..I‚Äôm thinking 2017ish through to around the middle of 2019/n<neu> Key takeaway from today was when narrowing down a watchlist for stock selection, reviewing to see if it is trading inside previous day range or outside of it in pmkt. $TSLA vs $AAPL and the range difference based on that item alone makes a difference/n<neu> @CryptoParadyme Either hedging or part of a spread

I threw a bit at $msft and holding $aapl leaps/n<neu> @BradHuston I am long AAPL sir. Now, can SNB please gap it up?/n<neu> @Apple Does your phone come with AAPL bonds? I want to buy if it does, so Fed doesnthave to buy it for you. üòâ/n<neu> If we Gap down tomorrow I‚Äôm buying calls 

$SPY $QQQ $AAPL $IWM $FB $AMD $VIX $MSFT/n<pos> @TrendSpider I believe $AAPL calls with time behind it will do good, in case they try to fake us out/n<neu> @wangruihan2 @tim_cook I'm buying #Apple

As in $AAPL #stocks/n<pos> @AlexDelarge6553 $aapl... I hope!/n<neu> @SamSharplesMT @ARKInvest Wow I didn‚Äôt even notice it was the $ARKG fund- I really hope that was a mistake bc that last thing I need is any more exposure to $AAPL as I own $ARKG and $AAPL is my biggest holding along with $AMZN/n<neu> @ForwardDividend I'm trying to get rid of all energy and materials. Probably a good time to hold off on RE as well. I think visa and mastercard are considered financials. For tech consider AVGO QCOM MSFT AAPL/n<neg> @GlennKesslerWP Thousands of emails off that AAPL COMPUTER WILL CIRCULATE. The owner turned it over to FBI  BUT THEY DID NOTHING... Gee I wonder why.   Swamp infested/n<pos> @TrueBubbleHead Hell yeah. I‚Äôm still sticking to my 118$ brotha!

Looking for $151 by dec/n<neu> @christoparrott @SamSharplesMT @ARKInvest I wonder if that was a mistake unless they really believe health is going to be a meaningful part of $AAPL‚Äôs future./n<neu> @mattjstreicher There are lots of different ways to count $AAPL short term right now. I'm sending a new chart update in a few minutes./n<neu> @RampCapitalLLC @jposhaughnessy .25 (that's about what I paid for AAPL 30 years ago)  Was only a 1250 dollar investment.   

My first stock.   True story./n<pos> @KermitCapital I like that idea a lot. Health is definitely where $AAPL is headed and someone like $PACB would be a great one./n<pos> @kylewdennis Pulled off big gains today! ...mostly AAPL and NIO calls in the first hour of this morning. You have given me the confidence and knowledge to succeed Kyle! Only 2 days of losses out of past 12 days. As of today, my account has increased nearly $50k in under a month!/n<neu> I think $AAPL went green today because the $GS and $MS buyback desks were given orders to prop it up, but that is probably just a conspiracy theory, lol./n<neg> @MarketRebels Fuuuuck! Gonna have to trade up my $AAPL shares for $NIO for now I hate doing that!/n<neu> Sold my $AAPL stocks and watching the price decline now...I‚Äôll buy in again.../n<neu> @NiccoVente @TKPTrader @MoMoBagholder @jam_croissant @DaveHcontrarian @no_pullbacks I think it‚Äôs easier to manipulate RUT since the market cap of all RUT companies &lt; market cap of AAPL.

Look up the P/Es./n<neu> @MartoskiSteve @LightVibes @iamtomnash It would stay in the tech sector. Which stock exactly? I‚Äôm not entirely sure, but a few on the list would be $NFLX, $AMZN, $AAPL, $SHOP, $ZM, $NVDA among others/n<neu> @jaylenwtradr I dont know anything about these stocks, i bought aapl with 18000 and holding that one forever/n<pos> @CyberDog2 @RobInTheBlack Had a few good ones today though, Rob stopped me from losing on aapl and I won on BA and spy ‚úÖ‚úÖ thanks again Rob!/n<pos> @traderswin @hoyasaxa1978 I think that's a good estimate.

Companies like $RIG were at $100 a share now essentially worthless./n<pos> @ruleof40 @PythiaR $AAPL long at $0.75 not a joke. Bought it when I held the first iPod - 4 buttons and all- I don‚Äôt have much of the original buy left, but I kept enough to change my life!

Other P/C ratios also supports mixed action.

$SPY $QQQ $AAPL $TSLA $NFLC $NIO $SPCE/n<neu> @jpr007 @LightVibes I thought the OP was comparing the person that sold AAPL back then (in the quoted tweet) to someone buying TSLA now. All I pointed out is that is not an apt comparison

If you‚Äôre right and we see $3200 a share that is still ‚Äúonly‚Äù 7.2x from here not even close to the quoted tweet/n<neg> One of the things that I have been worried about is how to handicap the regulatory risk to $FB $AMZN $AAPL and $GOOGL. I have read a lot on the subject but it is very difficult to translate that info into actual predictions. The uncertainty is high. Interested in other's thoughts/n<neu> @LightVibes @jpr007 Split adjusted price of $.40 for AAPL in 2001, the stock has appreciated 297.55x based on the current $119.02 price with a $2.06T marketcap.

If TSLA did a 297.55x that would be $130,847.61 a share and a $121.9T marketcap or 59.17x the size of AAPL today. Sorry, I don‚Äôt think so./n<neu> @BrianFeroldi There is bipartisan support to break google, not there yet for fb aapl or msft . i am betting goog will be the first one to be broken up and each of those businesses will have caps of $0.5-1T each.

My Ex told me to invest in $AAPL at 96$, and i‚Äôve been investing ever since in stocks Trading currencing for a couple years a decade ago. Would it mean i have 13y experience in trading futures? Absolutely fkn NOT!üòú/n<pos> @curlybirdi I did this last Monday. Sold my $AAPL &amp; put it all into $NIO. Only had 6 shares of $AAPL but got rid of all of them for $NIO. Glad I did. Took off two days later. Depends what you feel comfortable with. I believe NIO is going to be a $100+ stock.

When was the last time a AAPL or AMZN who are cash flow positive (meaning they actually make $) do a stock offering to raise money?/n<neu> I REMEMBER WHEN $AMD and $TSLA WAS $2 and $48 RESPECTFULLY and $SNY and $DAL were both $9 AND $BA and $AAPL were $118 and $128 @MadMoneyOnCNBC/n<pos> @Noble_Nomad For sure! That one is a surprise

Same with $AAPL - I think people expected them to have a better week, but I guess the lead-up (hype) was bigger/n<neu> If I were in USA, I would have set a naked put at 110 in aapl now for nov 27 expiry.
110 is a great price to buy the stock if things go south.
But, most likely the options should easily give $150-300  profit per lot(100).
No idea what‚Äôs US margin requirements though./n<pos> I hold $AAPL in highest regard as a brand, as an instituton, for myriad of reasons. They are one of the handful cos who aren‚Äôt doing lip service to shaping a sustainable üåé From carbon neutral pursuit to recent bold move of cutting down redundant products in the box chargers../n<pos> @jeremymday Interesting reading mine are

Maybe, wait until you get more clarity on the ‚Äúcall option‚Äù that is the FSD rewrite by watching early videos that come out before selling or trimming./n<neu> It is SUNDAY CHART DAY! Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking at:

1. $AAPL forming a cup and handle pattern into ER, could push stock into 52wk highs. 
2. $TSLA forming a consolidation, could go either way at ER. 
3. $NIO &amp; $PTON continuation patterns. $30 &amp; $140 targets for this week./n<neg> Everyday you wake up to the alarm on your $AAPL iPhone, shower using $PG head and shoulders shampoo, drive your $TSLA to the office, log into your $MSFT computer whilst sipping on a $SBUX coffee.

Comment some more down below ‚è¨/n<pos> @TheAcuraDays @CanteringClark My yes vote indicates I personally am more bullish on #BTC. That said, whether you should sell your $AAPL depends on, e.g., how long you've owned it (re: capital gains tax), what your profit is, etc. Not necessarily a simple decision nor something I can advise on. Good luck./n<pos> I'm really liking the new iphone 12 mini. Anyone else? $AAPL/n<neu> @CyclesFan Intermediate top is a subset of local!

I was thinking to myself what earnings are around 10/28. Then I was analyzing the chart of $AAPL and saw that it reports earnings the day after. $GOOGL and $AMZN also report 10/29. Heavy hitters!

Catalysts for a run up and then a sell off?/n<pos> I am using #TradeUP. Check out #Apple (AAPL). Price 197.15./n<pos> the only reason why i hold and invest in $AAPL is because they are tapping into a new "necessity" business model through technology.. health care and the aging community. 2 life principles: death, and moore's law/n<pos> $AAPL I wonder how many iPhones will be sold in India now that they have an Apple store on line that also offers financing and trade ins? Could be massive, but will for sure be better then prior./n<neu> @coloradotravis @RaoulGMI That's why I think an 8x prediction is conservative.

Roughly just above that 50MA again. New resistance now probably anything between 118-119./n<neu> @great_martis @AsennaWealth It is a ‚ÄúTale of Two Cities‚Äù dynamic. Before I relocated to FL this summer, I lived in Silicon Valley for 25 years. $AAPL - a two trillion dollars market cap company got homeless tents right outside its headquarter in Cupertino. Same with $TSLA auto plant in Fremont./n<neg> @great_martis @AsennaWealth As long as 10% of the pop still makes $300K+ income at the likes of $AAPL, $AMZN, $GOOG, etc, enjoys latte at $SBUX and overpays for bulk stuff at $COST, a great bear mkt isn‚Äôt happening. 90% of the pop that owns little stocks can eat shit and die, we would still have a bull mkt!/n<neg> I wake up this morning: 

- Stimulus negotiations are shaky 
- Gold is down

AAPL now retraced approx half its recent move - id think odds of a bounce improving/n<pos> @DPogrebinsky I feel as though AAPL having retraced approx half the recent move is looking good 116-118 area with strong newsflow continuing. I think Monday‚Äôs move is derisking both ahead of elections (general macro noise) and earnings season (sensible in some respects) but still broadly BTD/n<pos> I will back to use iPhone 6 :)) $AAPL  is still upgradeable/n<neg> @ohhushmusic @saxena_puru Lately I've been questioning my exposure to $AAPL. I have a large holding in the $QQQ in my IRA. Mostly because it's less for me to manage while I'm pretty active with my brokerage. Been thinking of managing that account as well. It feels like I'm missing a big opportunity./n<neg> @ohhushmusic @saxena_puru I understand it has performed but $AAPL is so unattractive to me at this point. I get the revenue is enormous. But why not own $AMZN or even $FB that both have far greater growth and and likely equal "safe". Although I hate $FB as a business. The growth and revenue is there./n<neu> @ohhushmusic @saxena_puru I‚Äôd be surprised if $AAPL returns 10-15% from these valuations. I could happen but what if it rerates to 20X?/n<pos> @ohhushmusic @saxena_puru Oddly enough, I keep $AAPL and $AMZN as portfolio anchors in a sense. Almost like the "safe bonds" you'd have in a traditional portfolio. Pretty sure they will keep delivering solid gains every year. I don't worry about these as I do about some of the others./n<pos> @jimcramer I have held $AAPL for over 7 yrs. and I thank you for that./n<neu> @ohhushmusic @saxena_puru $AAPL - I will continue to hold unless the fundamentals change.  I would rather not pay the cap gains taxes and I‚Äôm ok with 10-15% a year in my long term account./n<neg> @nosunkcosts I understand this is the stated justification, but it‚Äôs wrong!  If you‚Äôre a mutual fund manager, you legitimately need to keep, like, AAPL exposure or there‚Äôs material benchmark risk.  Even the most cowardly index hugger shouldn‚Äôt care about the upside risk of 0.2% airline expo./n<neu> @ImTylerSchmidt @TheMarkCooke Not in my case, buying in the crash will bring my average cost per share up because my existing holdings like $AAPL was bought at $0.42 in 2003 and $QLD was bought at $2 or so per share.  So when I meant buying during the crash, it meant buying something I don't already own./n<neg> $aapl puts printed today. Hate to say it but no stimulus I‚Äôm going very bearish until after the election/n<neu> @HeroDividend Don‚Äôt have any individual growth stocks. Unless $AAPL is considered a growth stock lol. However, just today I initiated a position in a blue chip growth ETF./n<neu> $SPX ans $NDX at key levels. If 21 ema does not hold there is potential for a significant down move which could result in some sort of crash again... No doubt there are plenty of reasons out there.

Could use a few wins this week./n<neu> Whatever the EPS of $AAPL whether great or bad , let the dust settle 

It doesn‚Äôt matter if they make $5 dollar per share one time due to COVID 

What matters is can they be a 3 trillion $ company 

If they miss EPS I wanna buy dip 

If they exceed EPS may be a sell around 125/n<neg> $AAPL ER will be great no doubt because in last 8 months of pandemic I have done nothing but bot their shit they peddle no questions asked 

But which one is more likely ? 

1. Pop to 125 then sell there 

2. Sells to 102-105 and find buyers there

I'm really curious to see how this overall downtrend will play out with earnings for names such as $AAPL, $FB and $MSFT/n<pos> @Aureliano_no_24 I think this is a good point for investors also, bc there is no way to entirely unwind China exposure. It‚Äôs all relative, as with anything. There is no 100% free country, and there is no 100% free portfolio, even if you only own $AAPL. But 5% exposure is better than 50% exposure./n<pos> iPhone 12 Pro is an absolute BEAST! I was on the fence about the upgrade from my 11 Pro, but I think the upgrade is a big enough jump in performance to do it.

No, I have $srrk, they want to kill the shorts, so it does not matter the amount of assets (less than $200 million), or the market opportunity ($3.9 billion)

I would buy $srrk because it may go to $100 tomorrow, it may have a market cap of $5 billion !/n<neu> @SongSong1 I‚Äôm sitting on 200 $AAPL shares at 115 cost basis.

Just a feeling. $AMZN $AAPL $GOOG/n<pos> $AAPL has a really interesting setup going into earnings.  Similar PA as last quarter leading up to announcement:  horrible.  I thought for sure last quarter it was a bad omen and the opposite happened.  Got the pop corn ready (and OOM straddles).  $QQQ $SPY $BTC/n<neu> @jespow @ValiumMm8 @CalvinAyre @PeterMcCormack Reminds me of when NASDAQ delisted AAPL, NYSE delisted Salesforce, and LSE delisted Lloyds, because the exchanges didn‚Äôt like some of the people involved with the companies and only relisted them once said companies were successfully extorted. How very enlightened, @jespow!/n<neg> $AAPL I should not be surprised but I am. Where is Trump, Pelosi, Mnuchin, Kudlow, etc.. today? With everything going on, we have not heard one word out of them. Crazy/n<neu> @hmeisler This was Spx, NQ, MSFT and aapl this am...all lockstep mostly/n<neg> I mean I‚Äôm not participating in any $AAPL earnings estimates (WAGs in my case), but if FQ3 was +11% YOY revs somehow, you could do worse than apply a similar-ish growth rate to FQ4 (reporting tomorrow) and subtract for iPhone 12s shipping the next fiscal quarter.

Looking at old chart. 2003 after split price was roughly 20 to 40 cents a share. 1sh in 2003 is now 56s.
Anecdote - have a friend who bought AAPL late 80s. Held it. Now worth $5 - $10 million./n<pos> @basilnsage seems to me like $AAPL the key if we can have a bigger turn....pos divergence on W%R on 1H ES.../n<neg> In that case, I believe most users would choose $GOOG regardless of an $AAPL search engine. If $GOOG is not allowed to pay to be the default, I very much doubt $AAPL will be allowed to make itself the default on iPhone. In Europe, $GOOG is already barred from this with android/n<neg> $AAPL inches higher, up $1 from the lows.  The only downside I can see is my Dad was complaining this weekend about how it should be back near the highs (he has never sold a stock, I mean not once)./n<neu> $AAPL Near 1 billion dollar print (8m shares) at 114.89

Big move with earnings expected.  No levels for this since earnings is unpredictable for me, but fyi for those who like gambling small amounts for big win (or total loss)

$AAPL üé∞/n<neu> @CryptoWhale So the new york times story about the GOOG AAPL co-opetition doesn't mean Tim Apple is playing nice? Hope all these companies are hit with anti-trust suits, but I am certain the incumbent Dems will make sure that zero gets done while holding all 3 branches./n<neu> @stocks_eagle I believe all variants in the states are sold out via preorder at the current time.

I wonder how something like this could impact those payments?

Anyway, futures indicating it won't break above downward trend channel. Big nose dive just now. Yikes!/n<neu> $FVRR just blew out estimates for 3rd qtr Revenues, EPS GAAP , non-GAAP ! Move up to 160 tmrw?  If mkt is higher in late Nov, then i can see FVRR @ 183 again. Conviction stocks: FVRR CRWD U IIPR LVGO AMWL OTRK AAPL/n<pos> @Benzinga Well...$MSFT reported very good results after the close and you saw profit taking. I think $AAPL and $AMZN will have very good numbers Thursday. However, PE‚Äôs are stretched historically, and despite good numbers, you could see more sell the news, folks banking ahead of election../n<neu> @carlquintanilla A 13 year old that has ambition and curiosity...please. That‚Äôs not a bubble. I started when I was 15 and thought I was good when I bought AAPL in 2008/9. If it was a grown person, yeah I‚Äôd call it a bubble...not a kid/n<neu> @eric_young_1 I was thinking of prime. But it‚Äôs still a stretch. On prime users are shoppers first. On Apple TV+ they are AAPL device owners first who have made a number of specific decisions before they watch content./n<pos> If this plots  gets 100 likes and 100 retweets by Sunday I will open this weekend webinar to my followers #stocks $SPY $NVDA $JMIA $QQQ $AAPL $U $SNAP/n<neu> Other than iron condor on $aapl i got nothing to think of before the earning./n<pos> Some great looking charts established today $CHWY $SHOP $SE $SPOT $VEEV $AAPL $ARKG $AYX $BABA $TCEHY. I‚Äôd keep an eye on those stocks resting on their moving averages and attack when I see a follow through day like I did with buying $SHOP after the close yesterday. Def got lucky/n<neg> As an investor, it bugs me when I see people buying $1000 #iPhone12. 

Absolutely mind boggling ü§Øseeing this happen.  

If you don‚Äôt know at least 20 shares of $AAPL you don‚Äôt deserve an upgraded iPhone. üì±

P.S. currently typing this from iPhone6S with cracked screen. ü§£/n<pos> @jonnajarian Jon   $AAPL UOA was a $10 spread, right?  I like your lower strikes.   3@3 is great ; thanks/n<neu> @tim4hire @MimiProbably @MichelletypoQ I'm with the legal panda: taking the risk was prudent at the time.  but the moment the GOOG/AAPL framework was announced (2 weeks before the AB app went live) should've been the stop-the-presses moment. At that point, it was obvious there would be a different idiomatic solution./n<pos> (3/4) which came lower than analysts‚Äô estimate of $40.5B. For me, this is a great company but at these prices it's still not a buy. It's earnings season so we'll continue to monitor $AAPL, $FB, $AMZN, etc. And even though, they already reported we'll continue to watch $TSLA for/n<neg> @Noble_Nomad @TheStacksMarket The market has been everything but predictable like we wanted it to be...and stocks have been rarely growing as we thought they would. $TSLA included. I mean, look at $SPAQ. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Even $AAPL- $MSFT and many others./n<pos> I am using #TradeUP. Check out #Apple (AAPL).

The last one I can remember was aapl downgrade to sell 2-3 days before stock split.

Just inverse whatever dogshit they‚Äôre putting out there/n<neg> @CHill_TDA CH - caught the archive of today's TechSpeak. Looking at the Analyze tab, Risk profile, the collar looks looks to me like a synthetic short on the stock. The straddle looks risky. Have IV dropping on bought options and have heavy time decay. $10 move on AAPL on eps seems high./n<neg> @JonahLupton Brutal. The maturest companies i own are $MSFT and $AAPL. I hope this is not their fate./n<neu> @CMoise51 @htsfhickey I agree with you. very hard to hold on. $AAPL, $AMZN and $MSFT had some big drops along the way. I sold $MSFT in 2000 after a big 6 year run up. I should have held on. bought again in 2009 altho a smaller position. done great but holding the original would have been the best move/n<neu> @MCubed1111 There is usually a massive option IV pump and dump before these ER's. Seen it time and again with $AAPL, especially. I actually see it unlikely that $MSFT stays in that range by Friday. I see those prices happening Wednesday, but then a fresh wave (iii) rally after that./n<neu> @itsburleigh The election volatility is hard to play, yes. It's made me reduce position sizes to 1/3 of what I would normally enter. Go back and look at the July response to earnings. $MSFT reports early, beats, but sells off, while market consolidates ahead of $AAPL, $AMZN, $FB, and $GOOG./n<pos> Currently reading through the $SBUX, $AMZN, $FB, $GOOGL, and $AAPL earnings reports.

So far the $SBUX and $AMZN reports have only made me more bullish once digging in.

EAT  - SLEEP - PROFIT üöÄ/n<neu> 2/ Since when do we have to spoon feed investors the impact of delaying a product launch by a month? The rev we didn‚Äôt get in 3Q we get in 4Q.  Even with IPhone delay, $AAPL 3Q revs ($64.7B vs $63.7B est) and EPS beat ($.73 vs $.70 est). I‚Äôm a buyer If AAPL opens &lt;$110 tomorrow./n<neg> $aapl $btc

Hakunamatata. ‚úåüèº/n<neg> @SilviaBellrock I did not make a single move today I rode my AAPL calls thru earnings and now I want to üò¢ profit to loss in the blink of an eye!

Just look at AAPL fiscal year end. Revenue of 274 billion &amp; they now hold 191 billion in cash. If I didn‚Äôt already own so much I would still be adding. I say just buy &amp; hold #AAPL/n<neg> I should‚Äôve placed a put on aapl right before closing, I had a feeling it would tumble after earnings/n<neu> @jtourzan Ordered a new iPhone. Was only 52 in line for my entire city. Signed up for the pre sale late too. Only a few days ahead of release. 

In the past I‚Äôve been in the 200‚Äôs on that list. Reserving just minutes after deposit reservations start. 

AAPL shareholders should panic!/n<neg> @duckman1717 I‚Äôve been really disciplined over the last few weeks during this choppy mess and I broke today. Played AAPL earnings at the close like a F‚Äôn dumb ass! But it‚Äôs no ones fault but my own. Have to be better!/n<neg> Apple's stock price, previously up 57% YTD, is still down 5% after Tim Cook's analyst call. Cook and CFO Luca Maestri said iPhone sales in the big holiday quarter would only "grow" from last year, when iPhone sales started in September, so I guess that's disappointing? $AAPL/n<neg> @thetradejourney Sorry to hear that. I got hit by $AAPL lack of guidance, hurray ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> $AAPL shares gas dropped today after earning report. I actually think the numbers were good. iPhones sales jump is only expected next quarter. I liked the devices Rev. steady growth which is the major upside potential for the stock./n<neg> @SteinCapital $AAPL Should‚Äôve sold at 116 as I did. The phones were released late this year and the company didn‚Äôt have enough time to make money on sales for Q4 rev and also the Pro Max didn‚Äôt even release yet so that‚Äôs why it dipped. You‚Äôll make your money back and some after the holidays./n<neu> After reading through the earnings releases for $AMZN, $AAPL, and $FB, my conclusion is that $AMZN and and $FB met expectations while $AAPL was a bit of a disappointment. 

That being said, still great companies. I can‚Äôt imagine investors heading for the hills on these reportsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> @s_m_a_sh_1 @Darci__Anne I would wait a few weeks to buy $AAPL unless you are buying to hold for 1-2 yrs imo/n<neu> @tumtonks Used to think that.

Until I saw:  

It is/was the default symbol on every major stock platform‚Äôs empty search bar.  If you were not using it, AAPL would be grayed out in the search little box so you‚Äôd know where to go to search.

2020: 3% earnings carry

2015: cheap to the market = multiple expansion if it catches up
2020: expensive to the market = multiple contraction if it catches up

I‚Äôd guess $AAPL needs 8-10%+ earnings growth to break even over 5/n<neg> @psk2329 I don‚Äôt get it. $aapl launches iphone the same time each year (October). I think the sales plunge was due to the ugly notch./n<neg> Damn $aapl you just fucked me upp bad/n<neu> Like I said before $AAPL pass it‚Äôs pivot already./n<pos> If I was in the phone business and I saw $AAPL no longer including chargers w/ phone

Would not only keep including charger w/phone, but I'd throw in some wireless earbuds, a case, etc, multiple add-ons that cost very little to the bottom line

But now give you huge advantage/n<pos> #AppleOne rolling out tomorrow willl give me enough savings to cover #Netflix at the new higher price üòä $AAPL/n<pos> Nothing to say about hardware bundles says @tim_cook but very interesting point about installment plans looking a lot like a subscription plan for buyers - and that is what most buyers are used to with phones which makes the purchase/upgrade much easier $AAPL/n<pos> @CryptoCrewNews And AAPL TV, Homepod, I basically control everything in my house with Apple Home. Track my kids, control their devices, etc.../n<neg> I mean, YES, it's not a TERRIBLE question, but you're asking if Apple will do a buy-in-bulk DISCOUNTING of its HARDWARE. It...hasn't EVER done that, not on a consumer level. You want discounts, look into edu, etc. $AAPL/n<neu> Hey guys remember when I bought $AAPL puts? 

Yeah same....I still have them

I am FURIOUS though, because the 10 $SPY 328p's that I bought on accident at 3:52 would have made me an incredibly rich man/n<pos> Hey stock market I'll see you after election $SPY. sold some and secure cash . Hehe you guys are more than welcome to bring down $aapl and $ba to one $$$$/n<pos> At a glance here are my thoughts on tonight's earnings.

$AAPL Beat solid, not surprised on no guidance, pull back presents a good opportunity to buy.

$AMZA Continues to show great growth, I like it here.

$FB and $TWTR: $FB better pick in the social media sector, $TWTR.. hype/n<pos> Lol $aapl. Not bad only 3% down. I am telling you if you want to bring down apple all ya gotta do is Iphone sales. And yet stock went up to 500$ eventually lol./n<neg> @polan13 I definitely think wehave.  $FB started to dump finally, too (not as badly as $AAPL).  

The run-up today must've been delta-hedging by dealers against call options for earnings.  Could be a nasty unwind tomorrow./n<pos> @lcc007 We‚Äôll see $AAPL was no bueno and it usually drives the market. I‚Äôd be fine with some more discounted prices :)/n<pos> AAPL I was looking for 109.50ish and then decided to enter a bit higher; of course, right now it's 109.55.  So you can get a better price than I did if you are interested in an add here.  I'd add in steps...given the general market volatility into and after the election.../n<neu> @stephenLweiss @dab2010_ I'm a big $AAPL fan....but the revenue drop wasn't bullish.  $FB could be peak advertising revenues with the drop-off from the election.  $AMZN is priced for perfection and who knows what the holiday season will look like with rising jobless claims./n<neu> @MidwestHedgie @aaronvalue TWTR down to $44 AH - it was here a month ago, had run up more than I expected. I was  expecting $2B to be used on buybacks back in April in the $20s. (As for volatility, I was overweight AAPL 2007-2019, have seen some crazy swings, e.g. -13% on earnings Jan '13)./n<pos> @kabirS13 I just held a aapl leap through Er lmao idk what I was thinking, only one tho so it‚Äôs fine/n<pos> Tim Cook teasing with "without giving away too much, I can tell you that this year has a few more exciting things in store." $AAPL #applesilicon/n<neg> starting to think today was a huge equities bull trap

REEEeeEEEEeeEEEEeee

Then there‚Äôs the fact that we‚Äôre finally making the transition into 5G. Apple will benefit from loyal customers and high switching cost. This is a micro miss to a much larger picture. I‚Äôm very bullish on $AAPL/n<neg> Today was one of the strangest days I have experienced as a trader. It wasn‚Äôt about an up day or a down day. Just a bizarro world day! I sold $TWTR on the pop this morning and just watched the tape all day.

Huawei is still trying to recover from the effects of the trade war and limited access to chip manufacturers. The demand for the iPhone is only going to increase in China...../n<pos> @Darci__Anne Market is so hard to figure out these days. $AMZN reported Strong numbers and Solid outlook but initially stock was up $110 in AHrs and now down $50. 
$AAPL reported good numbers too beating estimates but I believe didn't provide any guidance imo./n<neg> @MacRumors @julipuli Meanwhile shares of $AAPL are trading lower after hours.

I think also, mkt thought there was more risk around iPhone sales (trendy?)
Now it‚Äôs just accepted - sort of like infrastructure./n<neu> iPhone 4FQ20 revenues disappoint while iPad and Mac largely beat. This means to me pent up demand building for the new iPhone 12 (and the street struggling to model late launch.). $AAPL/n<neu> @Reuters Check when the iPhone 11 launched vs. when the iPhone 12 launched.. get back to me... AAPL still beat total revenue estimates and Y2Y WITHOUT a new iPhone launch... tell me that‚Äôs doom... LOL. Buy the HELL out of that stock./n<pos> AAPL stock being down after today's earnings is pretty surprising to me. If I were an investor, I might see that as an opportunity to buy the stock.

I could see Apple having a huge Q1 2021 holiday quarter given it includes all iPhone pre-orders.

Cheers !üçª/n<neu> @charliebilello Yeah there are some valuation issues in market. Apple is certainly not the poster child in this regard. I wonder what AAPL's market cap would be if it traded at AMZN multiples?/n<neu> At 14:48 I was going to buy an $AAPL put for .92 exp tomorrow, I talked myself out of it.

That call on the $AAPL top, on October 13th as it hit $125 has to be the most immpressive and precise call I‚Äôve seen!/n<pos> One again I have to mention that Apple results were very good considering there was no iPhone launch in the quarter (vs the iPhone 11 launch in the year ago quarter). 

Record September quarter revenue under those conditions is remarkable.

I am looking at the earnings numbers.
Not one earnings miss. All earnings beats. All revenue beats too. All upbeat outlooks.

This will lead to sustained #stockmarket rally.

$AMZN $FB $SBUX $TWTR $GOOGL $AAPL $TDOC $QQQ/n<neu> @Mdw37683404 Bullish on $AAPL too, but I don't think we see sustained breakouts until after the election.

Think we see $125+ if we are solid after hours and higher tomorrow./n<neg> @RealBrianWatt I held onto my ass but not my AAPL stocks lol/n<neu> Are these earnings smashers by all of FAMGA good or bad in the long term? 

Like is $Googl beating by $5/share with OM higher by 400 bips good in the long term?

The market will make up reasons out of thin air to like or dislike earnings tonight... so... who knows/n<neg> @ZenTraderEW Sorry I must have commented on the wrong thread. I meant $AAPL./n<pos> @petenajarian I agree , if $AAPL gives good numbers and issues guidance it will hit 120$ !  #GiddyUp !! @HalftimeReport/n<neu> Big ERs afterhours today on $FB $AMZN $AAPL $ATVI $SHAK $GOOGL $GOOG $DECK and $SBUX.

Same logic as $fb and $amzn. $msft was a perfect example/n<pos> @theqpid55 Nice! I bought a new $QQQ strangle for 11/13, already sold calls side (and took profits on other calls into strength: half of $AMD, all of $AAPL, $NIO - could've made more, but a win is a win). May add to the puts side at the close, but will see. Prefer cash and small strangle./n<neg> I‚Äôm not optimistic for $aapl earnings after yesterday‚Äôs close. I mentioned yesterday how today would be green following such a blood bath. I will be holding through er but will take $spy 330p to hedge my $aapl calls/n<pos> I hope you all have your $spom shares cause it‚Äôs starting! Spom week!! $aapl $rvdo $grnf $rnwf/n<neu> $AAPL valuation is too high IMO. I think it should trade between 85-90. My opinion doesn‚Äôt matter, but I think they need to hit it out of the park today. Even though I think it should trade lower, I think on any correction, no matter the time frame, 100 should be strong support./n<neg> Limp dick $TSLA. $AAPL $FB and others up 4-5% and TSLA barely holding onto a 1.4% gain. Next time the market flushes we'll fall another 3% guaranteed. I might bail on these calls, there's been no strength for 3 weeks all weakness/n<neu> Okay I just bought a couple of $SBUX and $AAPL puts because its another sell the news event IMO/n<neg> @odist_24 Naw options on an AAPL call...I ain‚Äôt into the bit coin craze yet don‚Äôt quite understand it/n<neg> People really bidding up these $QQQ names into earnings?

I still lean to downside, but who knows in this market./n<neu> That Amzn and Aapl pump before earnings./n<pos> $AAPL has been strong before the split and with their new iPhone numbers and 5G coverage I feel they will beat ER and have even better guidance. The healthy dip a d correction might be what was needed for the jump from ER. (NFA)/n<pos> $VMNT is my favorite position so far in OTC and I want more! Sold some $AAPL to get in before uplisting./n<neu> With $AAPL up this big before the bell don‚Äôt expect it to be higher tomorrow morning no matter how well they do in earnings - I swear I have seen this play out at least 4 times like this before/n<neu> Lastly these are my ER plays, remember traders these are extremely risky! 

Today $AAPL $ATVI $CAR reports AH, I have positions in all 3 but with plenty of time. $AAPL is my only shortest contract which expires on the 6th./n<neu> I have been watching $AAPL options  today. 

As of 12:30-45 the 10/30 $110 were on top with 36K in volume. 

Then all of a sudden I see 10/30 $115s come in at 45K volume. 

The 10/30 $117s were at $5.15 and are now down to $3./n<pos> Up 30 Percent on my $AAPL contract and I cleared it./n<pos> $AAPL:  I settled for 10/30 iron condors. 100/105/130/135. More I think about it the more I think this thing is probably going to take a breather tomorrow. Results will be at least decent, but we've had a big enough rally already today and there's a good amount of IV to harvest./n<pos> @Firetrade0129 i think so. but its all about how the market reacts to it... $AAPL i feel will surprise the most/n<neu> @Easymoney78 @SeaofTrades @Theboom28 i can't tell you what to do but don't sell calls on AAPL. if you do, make it a spread to minimize risk./n<neu> I didn‚Äôt dollar average in as aggressive as you; but just closed out for a gain on $AAPL !@kylewdennis/n<neg> @dyer440 Shorting a Wall Street darling like $AAPL.. not my cup of tea.

Just sold $AAPL.  $3/share profit.
I'll probably regret this decision./n<neg> @European_DGI Intuitively it would be $AAPL Starbucks more susceptible to Covid-19 problems and the price of their main commodity has increased.

Even if the "cockroach effect" applies here &amp; $MSFT was the first domino, never worth the risk to gamble on earnings with new entries./n<pos> I think big tech crushes earnings and causes the market to rally tomorrow. $AAPL $AMZN $Googl $FB. then friday afternoon we get huge sell off into next week/n<neu> Bot small Dec 4(w) call flies on $AAPL and $AMZN .

Long story short. They‚Äôre a $2 trillion dollar company

Buy AAPL 90 puts expiring 11/20 (55 cents)
Sell AAPL 80 puts expiring 11/20 (19 cents)

Cost = 36 cents per spread
Max profit = 10 bucks/n<neu> I think we will get #STIMULUSPACKAGE #STIMULUSCHECK so buying some $aapl $amd calls for a big pop./n<neu> $AAPL is going to have to have a hell of a rally in the last 15-min for me to take a piece home over the weekend./n<neu> @jimcramer Should I buy $AAPL before the close??

All We Ever Needed is one of my favorite songs, and I don‚Äôt see $aapl dipping all the way to 95 before a bounce back. I think it may barely pass 100, possibly 98, before picking back up./n<neu> Tina told me that $AAPL trades at a 4.2% FCF yield, with consensus growth CAGR of ~6.5% from here to 2025. If that rerates to a 5% yield, that's still ~7% returns over the next 5 years./n<pos> I'm not gonna lie, I stepped in front of the $AAPL and $MSFT steamroller twice this week to pick up a dollar, and both times I came out unscathed. 

I might either be a magician or a good trader/n<neg> I told my cousin that $AAPL was not a good buy after the stock split.

Watchlist: $AAPL, $GME, $OTSK, $SPY/n<neu> @vaghelax It has bounced back slightly to $111 as I type.

Cutting out these kinds of mistakes is my priority as I shouldn't be letting any trade get stopped below the -1x ATR(52 wk) level./n<neu> @asymco I made the mistake of selling my AAPL stock in March because I assumed the market continued to treat Apple as a hardware business, versus its peers that have ‚Äòstable‚Äô services businesses. I held the stock for 11 years, and will buy back in soon, but it was quite the lesson!/n<neu> @asymco I agree with you completely. I think that the market participants that have doubled the value of AAPL this year did not suddenly ‚Äúsee the light‚Äù. Some seem to be expecting a breakout quarter because of 5G etc, and will start to sell off when they don‚Äôt see it materialise./n<neg> @juliusagusta I listened to the entire conference call. I took 2 pages of notes. Both CEO &amp; CFO, Tim Cook &amp; Luca Maestri, kept using the words "confidence and optimistic" without those qualities in their voices.

I like $SLV a lot./n<neu> Took a couple tries but I'm taking a small $AAPL position home overnight./n<neg> @manuelofreire I plan to watch up until FL. If FL gets called for Trump, I may have to go to Planet B. üòÜI‚Äôm confident Biden can do it, but I don‚Äôt want to witness a Trump win. I know it‚Äôs the death knell for the Democracy. Also, I may have to reduce $AAPL b4 Trump heats up a war with China./n<neu> My position with $AAPL was $62 pre-split and I sold for a nice profit. Once that bad boy drops to $90s  I‚Äôm buying and holding long term./n<neu> @sajidnizami @MinvstrD @ReformedTrader @Bonecondor i don't think I am having trouble...but I could be wrong. if someone would explain what future corresponds to a 2 DTE VIX option, that would resolve the question

I just say options are on spot vix the same way I say AAPL options are on spot AAPL when neither is technically true./n<neu> @MinvstrD @sajidnizami @ReformedTrader @Bonecondor so to me saying you can't trade spot VIX is like saying you can't trade spot AAPL because the options are actually on the forward price of the shares.../n<neg> $AAPL could unveil MacBooks without $INTC processors ... but no one cares - leaving me confused/n<neu> @sajidnizami @ReformedTrader @Bonecondor OK. so as @bennpeifert pointed out to me when I asked a related question recently, yes obviously vix options are priced on forward vol. same way options on AAPL are based on the forward share price. 

I'm not sure that is the same as saying 11/04 VIX options are priced on /VX20/n<neu> Looking back about the progression of $aapl and the iPhone, I think they‚Äôll eventually do away with the lightning jack/n<neg> The scams are in full force. 1st, wanted my social security number.

And doesn‚Äôt include the political calls/n<neu> @GaogaoTina @ITMS I only do ones that are super high probability. So depends. FB and AAPL are already down too much and premiums too high to do options./n<pos> @Mateob_rad @SantiagoAuFund AAPL had a lovely blow off top, parabolic move after the stock split was announced and done. To me, in my opinion, it blew its load. Love Apple products, own a bunch, have owned the stock since 2008, however that price action with minimal growth through the years... üò¨/n<pos> Well I recieved so many DM over the weekend.

$aapl it has a room to grow but before we see 125+ we may see around 100 then I will triple down my dec calls/n<pos> @musicandwork starting to see value names outperform, although one day does not constitute a trend. I do like seeing AAPL AMZN ZM get sold off pretty hard while other names, especially $IWM do well - that is a good thing and healthy LT/n<neu> @MikeFeinberg3 I sold my AAPL and stick with TSLA, I have NIO contracts for next year. I‚Äôll try not to look./n<neg> @WilliamNextLev1 @JoeBiden Yeah you‚Äôre right, thats why $AAPL have higher amount of cash compared to others! i highly doubt sleepy joe would win this election! I can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôd win! Unless there is mailin ballots fraud somehow/n<neu> @stocks_eagle @JoeBiden I agree Eagle, but no company makes more total profit than $AAPL.  Thus, Biden's huge higher corp tax rate increase will affect $AAPL the most./n<neg> if you knew someone who was right more than 90% of the time, would you follow them ?

It should be obvious, but because it‚Äôs AAPL the CNBC fools will be demanding buy buy buy! Weak investors will say ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt short Apple... because it‚Äôs Apple!‚Äù

Here‚Äôs something of value:

Don‚Äôt believe any action you see today or tomorrow. It‚Äôs all an unpredictable illusion. Position yourself for the slaughter Wednesday morning, barring Fed intervention

My target of choice: $AAPL/n<neu> I'll be letting go of my $aapl between 111-112/n<neu> Hey, anybody know what $AAPL dividend will be post-split?

Hate it when I own it. Hate it when I don't. Fking stock.
Totally irrelevant rant üòí/n<neu> I'm only gonna say this once. Contested elections are bullish because it seduces people into buying puts/shorting and then the value seeking market fatties feed on it.

Bad Apple - AAPL!/n<neg> I find this AAPL prop search effort so suspect. They could simply give DuckDuckGo the default position and remain neutral &amp; bolster a truly indie search engine.

Was it that obvious at the time that it would become what it is? Same with $MSFT. Hindsight makes thing look so much easier, but they could've just as likely stayed where they were and been where $INTC &amp; $CSCO are today./n<neg> @anandchokkavelu correct, i am a $ROKU shareholder as well and I would sell $ROKU if that happened. I dont want anyone to buy them with the exception of $GOOG $AAPL or $AMZN/n<neu> @anandchokkavelu hmm I think $ROKU will be more powerful on their own in the long term unless someone grossly overpays for them like $AAPL but I don't think they get acquired/n<pos> Decided to finally pull the trigger and buy $AAPL.

I might be late to the game on this but I see this as a long term investment.

#Voyager is a long, slow play.

ü§î $AAPL/n<neu> Young Investors: On days like today, I suggest you don't do much buying or selling early on...let things shake out and maybe consider buying $FB $AMZN $GOOG $NFLX $AAPL around 3pm if still down big. Don't buy all at once...stage your buys! #tyi/n<pos> Good morning!

Great chat with a GRT Pro member last night. Remember, no matter what we think, expect, or feel the market is going to do, you need confirmation of that move before taking a trade. Stick to YOUR rules and you‚Äôll be profitable.

Good luck!

Also will go iPhone mini soon. 

$aapl/n<neg> After 10 years of daily use, I am leaving the $AAPL Podcasts app and moving to $SPOT. 

Tho partly due to Spotify‚Äôs long-term monopolization of major content distribution, my move today is due to three major defects that have destroyed the Podcasts app UX...

He's ultra defensive about AAPL which I think is bearish./n<neu> Net-net, looks like Apple:
-lowered prices only on mini
-didn't add special features like 5G, 4K display
-same crappy 720P camera, even Pro
-better battery life, fanless MBA
-Intel is the UPSELL on Pro
-8GB most mem on M1 Pro (what?)
I expected so much more. MOAR PROFITS $AAPL/n<neu> I‚Äôm still holding those $aapl calls and have averaged down here 11/20 135c at .10 new average is .55

Don‚Äôt mind the high strike but I think $qqq $spy $aapl might make a run tomorrow/n<pos> After today‚Äôs Apple event, I will be raising the potential ceiling for the Mac segment in terms of market share &amp; Revenue. 

With such a huge performance lead there exists a lot of potential to attack the sub-$1000 laptop segment in future years while maintaining margins.

$AAPL/n<neu> I do have to admit $AAPL has finally its A game.

Back to the drawing board ;(/n<neu> @wolfofharcourt @Thesecretinves2 I agree, after that Q3 and how well all segments are doing it‚Äôs hard to walk away. Looking to add here.

I expect a big fallout in the PC industry if $INTC can‚Äôt get their act together.

No fans on the new laptops, amazing speed and battery life... $AAPL

PS: No position/n<neu> Ok, actually going to sleep. Reminder that you could‚Äôve bought $AAPL at 10x earnings in 2016 but you didn‚Äôt. Well neither did I so let‚Äôs sleep it off./n<neu> For all those disappointed with $AAPL lack of upgrade in hardware I want to point out...with a significant upgraded to their engine #m1Chip I am certain they will invest and upgrade other features like larger screens etc.

Gotta have the power before all the bling. @EveryApplePro/n<neg> What‚Äôs wrong with markets!

Just ordered iPhone 12 Pro Max and 12 Mini last Friday. Now thinking of buying Mac Mini and MacBook Pro M1. Tired of Microsoft update crashes!!! $MSFT and $INTC are going to feel some heat from M1 devices./n<neu> @T66476371 @pawan1234o @johnscharts Haha, no biggie. The rumor/news was sent to me a couple months ago by broker to keep me updated. $AAPL is very long term hold in long/retirement accounts.

$AAPL, seems to be holding at 8d, 20d, 50d ( all converging). Not yet a Piercing Candle./n<pos> If $aapl M1 is great, I am pretty sure $tsm makes it possible. No other player can do a 5mn with a good yield./n<neu> The largest " rotation" I have seen in real time was 1999/2000 out of growth ( tech/ inet)  into value.  It happened during a severe Rout in growth ( tech down something like 80%)  .   Given how big tech is ( think aapl/ scamazon etc)  as a % of mkt cap in the Snp , feel lucky?/n<neu> I immediately sold nearly 5000 shares of AAPL that I had kept since iPhone days. I have more shares, but will need a while to digest this. But I haven't gotten this bad feeling from Apple, EVER BEFORE. I guess they want to please John Gruber, Rene Ritchie, and the like./n<neg> @jimcramer James woods told me he's keeping his aapl
shares and he hates everything and everyone nowadays except for DJT/n<neu> Now that the #AppleEvent is over ... Should I live tweet more events like I did or was it too much spam? $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL event over.....looks like a sell the stock event to me.

I‚Äôve always wanted one but could never afford it $AAPL $VZ @Apple @Verizon #AppleEvent/n<pos> Apple is worth $2T and counting. They haven‚Äôt made anything new since the watch.

I see $AAPL picking up a lot of market share here. 
#AppleEvent/n<neg> @AdamSinger I‚Äôd kinda like to see AAPL trading around $9 a share after making me delete this god awful U2 album for the hundredth time./n<neu> @kylewdennis while the AAPL announcement caused a bump, I played expected regression to mean after the event and BTO 11/13 117 puts for 1.73.

I‚Äôm going to do everything I can to wait one more year, but the gravitational pull to hit the BUY button is going to be strong. #Apple #AppleEvent $AAPL/n<pos> I want Apple's next event to be "Potato"

Literally they present a Potato.  No electronics, just a Potato.

I guarantee it would be the most exciting Food Event of the year.

Amazing Marketing, I salute you @Apple 

Full Disclosure I am a MAJOR shareholder with 100 shares of AAPL/n<neg> I fell I need to say this to all the $AAPL people - STFU about #AirTags, no one is talking about them other than people talking about them saying they are being talked about. 

Fleak ain't going to happen/n<neu> @todd_harrison I buy and hold for 5 years minimum. 

People didn't make good money with AAPL in under 5 years, or GOOG, or almost any great stock. 

Let the winners run./n<neu> @allout808 @Lucasify_ @CJ_Johnson17th This is 1 of themost important concepts newtraders should understand. This is why when AAPL split, I had 100shares; after split, I had 400 (4for1). Then I nibbled on dips toget to 500shares. AAPL is @ 117, a 1-point move with 1000shares ofany stk gets u $1000. Going 4 1000 shares/n<neg> $AAPL presentation so far is technical and they are talking about the M1 chip. TC brought up ‚Äúone more thing‚Äù at the beginning of the presentation. I hope he‚Äôs not thinking that the M 1 is it. Street will be disappointed and me to./n<neg> I guess as usual wall st won‚Äôt understand science and they will short $aapl after event/n<neg> Sold my $AAPL calls probably prematurely but i don‚Äôt like the R:R/n<pos> $aapl can make serious headway on the #AppleEvent today, if they so choose

At this point, they are ushering a new era of devices based on their own silicon

Essentially, they are great at hedging out 3rd parties, and this is a massive move

I wouldn‚Äôt buy calls, but buy shares/n<neu> Completely forgot about the $aapl event today. Every other time its been a sell the event for Apple. I'm still long./n<pos> Apple events are fun to me because I have nothing riding on them. I don‚Äôt own any $AAPL shares and if I did, I wouldn‚Äôt expect them to move much on an announcement of something we‚Äôve known for a while.

I just enjoy watching the show and how they try to make boring #‚Äôs exciting./n<neu> $AAPL Event in 20 mins, tech can get very volatile here!

$BABA testing $271 again, if you fails to get back I will exit the calls/n<neu> Market rotating out of tech. 

Out of an abundance of caution I‚Äôm continuing to sell or reduce positions in those &amp; anything undercutting yesterday‚Äôs low. Raising cash for the next chapter. They say that the Stock market looks ahead 12-18 months.

In general, acquisitions destroy value and distract management

Relative size is important
$AAPL buying $10 BB company = no big deal
$3 billion company buying a $2 billion = a VERY deal

I was looking for a picture of my dash that I took and the license plate.. 

amazing that you can search for an image by inputting a generic term.

Huge gap down yesterday and another one this morning.

Just a thought. Could be wrong.

Shit was trading at 10x earnings ffs. üòÇüòÇ/n<neu> @LhingMcgrace hmm. to be honest. apple just isn't the only stock in the world. I don't know but end of day...I know 120-130 has a tremendous resistance.

It's a very high quality biz and deserved a better multiple. Now that its 30x+ and not growing, it's a sell and reminds me of $KO in 1998./n<pos> As @michael_saylor has pointed out several times, today is not early-early for #BTC, but neither is it late, not by any stretch. He equates it to big tech ($AMZN, $AAPL, $GOOG) circa 2005. i.e., There is TONS of room for gobsmacking growth. It just requires patience!

of which I most appreciate AXP, BAC./n<pos> @DadInvest @cfischer6 @BluthCapital Ha from the Q it looks like they started to sell a bit already. But, uh, I think if $AAPL is trying to get to net debt neutral then this $50bb ASR seems like a win-win!/n<pos> I‚Äôm not claiming to be the next Buffett; I‚Äôve certainly made some mistakes (for ex. I almost sold a few thousand dollars worth of $BAC in 2003 to buy $AAPL. I didn‚Äôt, but $5k of 2002-2003 Apple stock would be worth $1.6 million today), but I‚Äôve done pretty well for myself./n<neu> @BluthCapital @kylerhasson I completely agree. They should be ringing the register on the AAPL investment, when it's trading 35x earnings versus Berkshire's core business under 10x./n<neg> @rosetti12345 @APompliano And I can name u 100 investors that own $aapl and $amzn. Chamath says Warren Buffett was his idol growing up. He loves btc Buffet hates it. Who cares. It is what it is they have there own opinion. Be a leader carve your own path following these guys is fools gold./n<neu> @kylerhasson Also mistakes: IBM, Airlines, Banks, Oxy Prefs, basically everything they've done since the BAC deal in 2011 except for AAPL.

So yes, I agree, and I think they should be buying back up to 1.4x book, especially with yield on cash near 0 now. $220 is a steal./n<pos> You could argue that you want Buffett to do outside deals, but even with a recent home-run success like $AAPL, you also have mistakes in Precision Castparts and Kraft-Heinz.

That's why I think $BRK is a great option on a *risk-adjusted* basis - little business specific risk./n<pos> I am using #TradeUP. Check out #Apple (AAPL). Price 197.15./n<neg> Hope you guys didn‚Äôt go crazy with trades today. I hate big gap ups or downs, becuz they tend to be premium burning days. No good setups today.

Delete this tweet and make new one saying how great the new iPhone is. k, thanks./n<neg> If $AAPL breaks under 118 I‚Äôm fighting someone/n<neu> @dapstats @DereckCoatney @andykatz19 @Celiwaves @CordovaTrades @VlanciPictures @MotherCabriniNY And FWIW, I am bagholding some $AAPL 11/20 $110 puts through the weekend into next week/n<neu> $AAPL killing calls today, I‚Äôm keeping my leaps/n<neg> AAPL just paid me my first 41 cent dividend, y‚Äôall broke niggas move around ü§ìüòÇ/n<pos> @5yearsagoal @johnscharts @pawan1234o @T66476371 Thanks @5yearsagoal. $NIO was a positional trade. Start with a Core position, add on dips and sell on specific profit targets, then repeat. Also leverage positions with Option Buys/Sells. Strategy has worked well for me: $AAPL $MSFT $LULU $RH. New one is $PLTR early Oct./n<neu> @nschumacher10 @SE01161854 You can't compare owing REITs to owning a house dude! two totally different topics! You can however compare owning a house in Regina SK, that yields 4% to owning a #vanre detached home.&amp; that's exactly the comparison between AAPL and REITs/n<pos> @RedlerAllAccess $AAPL- I played 1 of your moves, let it play out, then took a position off the low. Worked great./n<neu> @OG_Campbell lol i just got that AAPL dividend too/n<pos> @SunriseTrader @BlueFielder i assume $AAPL? GL to you!/n<neu> Sold $BYND and bought some $TDOC to lower my cost basis. Looking at adding to $AAPL but I think I will just wait for an incoming red day to buy something else, really eyeing $OKTA but want to see it pull back a little before I initiate a position./n<pos> I just received my first dividend from AAPL fook yea mate !/n<pos> You know what's cool about dividends?

In the future

$JNJ will cover my medical billsüíä
$T will cover my phone bill‚òéÔ∏è
$KO will cover my food&amp;beverage needsüç∫
$MSFT will cover my office360 on my computerüñ•Ô∏è
$AAPL will purchase the next phone for meüì±/n<neu> So that was a first Apple
 came up in the screen 
and just when I thought
" oh there's no way I'll be able to afford any options on this "
I was actually able to find some..
Happy Friday today's second 7-11 is $AAPL 118
Trade at ur own risk

If you prefer a REIT over owning AAPL in the long run, then best of luck to you brother! You've got your priorities wrong! very wrong!/n<pos> @Royal_Bloo @profitwithant $AAPL has shown consistent long-term growth events after the split. Though it's on my list I urge readers to do their due diligence and find the right entry points. I rely on 200-EMA, 20-EMA, RSI, etc. The dividends are just icing on the cake./n<neg> @Navainvest $AAPL killed me/n<neu> Funny how I‚Äôll never watch a 7hr movie but I‚Äôll watch the market for 7hr

Think‚Äôn there‚Äôs a surprise ending today./n<neg> @FightorDie83 @FSTrades I bought AAPL at $40 you don‚Äôt know shit about chop Mike/n<neu> @DoNotFadeMe I am with you on this one, AAPL start catching a bid... üôÑ/n<pos> Those $AAPL dividends hit this morning and truth be told, I wish Apple kept that money and focused on #exponetialGrowth/n<pos> @HeroDividend $AAPL paid their dividend today too! üôåüèª can‚Äôt wait to get that sweet $O drip. I need to stop paying for plastic bags at the grocery store for $.10 a bag tho üòø./n<pos> AAPL paid me $.26 in dividends. Fine I will buy a new iPhone it‚Äôs basically free/n<neu> I‚Äôm heavy in $aapl and I always pick one stock for a few quarters that I trade but also stay invested in for long term growth. My target üéØ price for Apple before I consider taking profit would be around 170-175 could be soon could be late, I can wait/n<neu> @Soumyazen $TDOC a) I suspect we will see further consolidation in the Telehealth sector, too many niche players. b) Threat from bigger players like $AAPL, $AMZN care and $GOOGL going all in. On a +ve note this is definitely not a C19 play and there is a lot of opportunity still untapped./n<neu> @RahkimSabree Got my AAPL dividend notice this morning. I actually hadn't known it paid a dividend!/n<neu> I made $100 in Dividends from #AAPL yesterday üí™üèæ/n<neu> I forgot I had #AAPL &amp; got hit with some dividends last night. Use the money to send to the distributor so I could flip that and buy more income. Simple ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> timed entry in $aapl been studying the chart for sometime now and I‚Äôm making my first entry at precisely11:23 central. Long, minimum 45 days out/n<pos> Pivot for me is 3553 in $ES, i like long to 3570, short to 3520....
$AAPL $SPY $NQ $SPX/n<neg> @ChazMarie_Ocean I don‚Äôt have courage to get back into AAPL and MSFT.....traumatized lol/n<pos> Pour some of gravy from $NIO, $XPEV, $LI into $GELFY, $GNZUF, $BYDDF, $NKLA, $GM. Move some from $FANG too. I am not very excited about $FB, $AAPL.
I like $TWTR a little! I also think if $GM deals with $NKLA, both win big especially, $NKLA. $BA is another winner 1H 2021! GL&amp;BW!/n<pos> Wake up to üí∞   thats what I like to see. Let those #AAPL #O dividends drip!/n<neg> Looks like I‚Äôm wrong on $baba so far. Everyone is running for the exits due to fear of the Chinese government. I guess they are learning from the US government and try to hurt their biggest and best companies that employee a ton of people. $amzn $aapl $fb $goog/n<pos> @erikcbutler @7investing @MKBHD $AAPL makes some nice personal products.  Healthcare software might be the most complex software there is.  $AAPL doesn't play at this level./n<neu> @dividendsNdrip Own AAPL.  I am still evaluating which high dividend stocks to have exposure too./n<pos> I'm not some Apple hater either, I have a watch and iPhone, they're great products.  

The flip side of all of this?  $MSFT is hitting it out of the park by catering to that same user group.  There is a LOT of $MSFT love and a lot of $AAPL griping../n<pos> 3:1 Risk to reward

All you need to do is win 26/100 trades to make profits

I know you can do that!

I feel this sums up AAPL.  While other companies have a broader scope, Apple just executes so much better when it comes to functionality, to the point where you don‚Äôt think about it...
