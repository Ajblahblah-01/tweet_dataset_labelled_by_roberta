A run of 200 funds to 1,500 funds is ideal for young growth stocks.

Fuck the puts üòÇ/n<neu> All of these I thought were great buys and I told people around me, yet I held out and set notifications at like $1-5 below their price, they never hit that price and now they laugh at me.

$AMZN - 3350C over 3340/n<neu> @BackpackerFI I‚Äôve always been an index fund guy, but today I made a small foray in another direction and bought 10k of $AAPL./n<neg> @AriDavidPaul I agree but it matters what you hold. The worst thing you can do is sell a great asset, anyone who‚Äôs taken gains from AAPL likely underperformed on capital reallocation. Are you an investor or trader / what‚Äôs your conviction / are you delusional on timing market - BTC long term/n<neg> @magicktrades I‚Äôm long on aapl but they‚Äôve been painful to look at these last couple weeks/n<neg> @StrizziJ I once said said to jingle in regards to him selling early on AAPL: you don't deserved to get married and have kids (cause you know you're supposed to leave AAPL to you grandchildren). Dude blocked me right after. Gotta make another twitter account to see his feeds./n<pos> @blinddartcap I like a lot of their ideas (i share their enthusiasm for $neu, for example), but i also wonder why they still maintain huge positions in $aapl at this point/n<neu> I‚Äôll buy AAPL below 2.5b market cap every single day until I‚Äôm worth 100mm or flat broke/n<neg> Promoters, focus on hyping new technologies, making BS comparisons to $AMZN $PYPL $AAPL $MSFT $TSLA c'mon ya know, the usual, right? In your coked out brains maybe the 1-2-3 cent/share short squeeze theory works, but in reality you discredit yourselves &amp; people send it to me LOL!/n<pos> @skimountaggie I bought cheap and decided AAPL will go up until I retire. A wise man told me hold for a little bit but thought good earnings would pull through/n<pos> @BackpackerFI You have $AAPL in fitness? üòÄ OMG I better sell it./n<neu> (4/6) advantage as these giveaways don't happen everyday. Subsequently, markets were red today as I expected but I'm not too excited just yet bc I want more red days to get the real discounts on stocks like $TSLA, $AAPL, $AMZN, $MSFT, etc. &amp; perhaps even on our current long term/n<neg> @Hugh_Henne @RocketCatchnBob I wish I knew not to hold options on spy or aapl over the weekend/n<neu> This is to tonight‚Äôs recap and look ahead.  I try &amp; give responsible/experienced point of view each day. Sometimes we play offense, Sometimes defense. $spx $btc $amzn $aapl/n<pos> @MandoTrading Late to the party but I snagged some $AAPL today. She looks to have a bounce in her soon./n<neg> I made a mistake opening a @CharlesSchwab account - Now everytime I call I'm on the phone for 2+ hours for a simple request - not fair or right - intentionally misleads consumers to thinking they have customer service @attorneygeneral Try calling yourself - $AAPL $SPY #schwab/n<neg> TSLA and AAPL making me hurt/n<neu> @Noggle_ I think $AAPL bounces next week, will post brief thoughts on it soon üöÄ/n<pos> @parabolictrav This is the second time for me. Saylor had great words back in 2010 to 2013. Kept me from selling my AAPL after I‚Äôd been sitting on it since 2002./n<pos> @caleb_investTML Yes I read it. You can not underestimate $TSLA 

There products are more useful than anything $AAPL or $MSFT have./n<neg> @OriginalSanders time will tell my friend.  these discussion are what make markets.  80-90% corrections will happen in alts for sure, I just don't think we see it for $BTC.  2017 was like the 2000 internet bubble.  those that survived (AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN) will never correct 80% again./n<pos> Top 10 stocks in my taxable brokerage account based on market value:

$DIS 11%
$TDOC 8%
$AAPL 6%
$SBUX 5%
$EVFM 4%
$BUD 4%
$SQ 4%
$SDC 4%
$MTCH 4%
$DVN 3%

I‚Äôm happy with 9/10 of these. Tremendous gains. Can you find Waldo? Its brand colors are red &amp; white too. #investing/n<neg> @RobertHenry87 In 2017 - when WPP looked at $CRTO, the shares were trading at $40-$50 area - given takeover premium is generally in the 30% mark - I assume $CRTO mngmt asked for something much higher - probably in the $65-$70 mark. $AAPL's move in 2017 to reduce ad tracking probs didnt help/n<neu> Let‚Äôs settle it once &amp; for all

What‚Äôs #MoneyTwitter? 

 ‚Äî&gt; FIRE / personal finance / Index investing?
 ‚Äî&gt; making $ on Twitter, i.e. ecom, copywriting, side hustle?
 ‚Äî&gt; meme stonks $GME, $TSLA, @RampCapitalLLC?
 ‚Äî&gt; long term stocks $AAPL?

Something else? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> @JustinB90072145 Or how about this one...

Every time $AAPL falls 20% from most recent high I buy more shares.  Have done so for about the last 8 years./n<pos> @BullTrendz So far I got 1 month of level 2 and 3 months of level 2... I would love $goog or $aapl./n<pos> My thesis is if good companies like $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL have less than 1% short interest then I will keep buying $TSLA on every single red day until the shorts cover current short interest on $TSLA is 6.79%/n<neu> @amcfarla This Heikin-Ashi cleans up the movement. I would also like to see the MAC D cross to the bulls for confirmation. This chart looks an awful lot like the current AAPL chart! #ineedconfirmation/n<pos> @TrendSpider Hope $LLY blows thru the 12 day this week...maybe back thru 210 to 212...likely sideways or down since options expire this week lol maybe $AAPL will save me/n<pos> @bluebeard I have been thinking the same thing about $AAPL and $MG. $MG happy to be in the background and construct for other brands.  Factory locations and tech also suitable.  They are already the chosen manufacturer for $FSR./n<pos> @KleinmanBHC I was gonna say I agreed with this most of the time but have added to stocks like $AAPL and $SHOP when they pull back to 200day/week MAs. But I've often trimmed those a bit on big runs and then have room to add more lower. So I think I agree with this 100% :-)/n<neu> @blainehodder @Find_Me_Value Nice thread. I liken $FB to $AAPL from a few years ago. The narrative was that consumers were moving on. The numbers said otherwise. Course, with FB they control the definition of a real account vs fake account and there's enough wiggle room for them to hide decay for awhile./n<neu> @StockDweebs hi what is your opinion about AAPL. I have 140 call expiration on March 19/n<neu> @SpaghettiCode4 big time!

I remember yesterday morning trying to figure out what was going on with $WATT, trying to figure out if it really was a deal with $AAPL. Getting sharp symptoms of FOMO

and you posting a graph looking for entry levels

helped me calm down and get back to rationality!/n<neu> @rationalwalk same goes for new #Apple #IOS updates - I usually wait awhile to upgrade unless it‚Äôs a security patch! $AAPL/n<neg> @vincent13031925 75% $TSLA, 10% $BTC, 15% ( $AMZN+ $GOOGL+ $AAPL). To minimize risk, I do not want to own any company I can not feel and use their products, $PLTR is one./n<neu> @Jon_investor @DanCaplinger Ha, fair enough. But I also have about 75% of my portfolio in REITs, financials, and stocks like $AAPL and $DIS. Most of my SPAC positions are tiny, like 0.2% of my portfolio./n<neg> @aaron_knill @wadhwa @smerconish @CNN I think that, in general people don‚Äôt understand BTC, Blockchain  and other disruptive tech. For example when AAPL came public Mass banned there residents to buy the stock cuz it was to ‚Äúrisky‚Äù I bought APPL hand over fist./n<pos> @auchenberg 100% Also got me excited about Apple (and AAPL) again. Feels like the future after a long stretch of missteps./n<neu> $AAPL give ME back my money Tim Cook./n<neu> I am swinging some #PLTR #CNP #TTCF #PTEN &amp; #AAPL/n<neu> My pattern recognizer is telling me that things that get to $1 Trillion market caps take a real quick swing to $1.3T and back again and then back up.

Gonna look at old AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN charts.

Bitcoin is not a company but interesting to look into./n<pos> @Click_Trades Would be a drop in the bucket for DXCM as well. I still remain interested in future of optical cgm if similar MARD can be reached. I think AAPL has the intent to leapfrog the need to replace sensors./n<neg> I lost bread on $FUBO &amp; $AAPL calls this week.. I made money elsewhere but those too pained me a little.. I‚Äôm getting revenge next week/n<pos> I think the smartest thing mega caps like $AAPL $MSFT $GOOG $FB $AMZN can do is not aquire smaller companies but...

Take equity positions in smaller companies like $TCHEY does...

$TSLA $SNAP $ATVI $SE all still independent companies but $TCHEY owns significant shares./n<pos> @stockinsane The amount of money won't be a problem when you know what you're doing. What makes your capital grow are % gains. Simply, $GNUS at less than 2 is easier to make you 40% on short term than $AAPL now, for example. Gain knowledge and you'll know what to do and when to do it/n<pos> @peony_king Very valid observations but what I might counter with is that the size that is being targeted implies domain expertise but after a certain point you look at inorganic growth and having a good Wall Streeter never hurts. Look at $AAPL IMO a brilliantly marketed annuity./n<neu> @HankMFRearden Monday I will be doing nothing. Tuesday or Wednesday I think will be the time to go three weeks out on $AAPL and $AMZN OTM calls. If $AMZN insider selling continues to wreak havoc, $AAPL will certainly hit 136+/n<neg> If Apple were to do non invasive cgm I would wonder about Dexcom‚Äôs long term prospects. May yolo $dxcm puts next applewatch release even though everything is 100% priced in. I would highly doubt fda approved pump integration anytime soon but the implications would be obvs $aapl/n<pos> Really looking into a lot of company's thats are in the üî¥ this week, #PLTR #TSLA #JMIA looking into purchasing a Share in Tesla and I believe there is still massive potential for this stock, also #AAPL is looking good too for you long term investors, should I purchase?/n<pos> Bitcoin $57,000 I sold 6 full Bitcoin for my house, do I regret it? No. But I learned my lesson. Never sell out of something completely if you believe in it. I do love my mortgage free, debt free life tho. Long $NIO $TSLA $AAPL/n<pos> @TheFoodTruckCEO @The_401k_Pro I do outperform. Our US stock portfolio delivered just under 30% in 2020. I believe the S&amp;P 500 delivered 18.4% in 2020. My portfolio has been on public record on Seeking Alpha for quite some time. 15 Lg Cap Dividend Achievers skims from early 2015, AAPL, BLK, BRK.B as picks./n<neu> One of the #freedomtraders analysts might have found the next $roku $nflx and it's a fudging penny stock. Join the discord to find out the ticker. We will all have 1/4 left in all of our swings. The next $amzn $aapl will come out from those swings. You're confused i know/n<pos> @fatbabyfunds 1. $AAPL bolsters its health segment/ iPads build into bikes 
2. Makes $DM a powerhouse in 3D printing
3. $BABA would get a big leg up on gaming
4. Bolster $SE gaming portfolio
5. Gets $JPM in the crypto banking game
6. One stop shop for Ad tech
7. Adds family friendly content/n<neu> @Kolo_Pepe I would say AAPL, AMZN or TESLA...Anything that has a strong hold on A.I. tech/n<neg> @AndersonMIZ @AnthonyMaceroni 20 years and had 2 $tsla and $isrg and idk nothing I saw had me knowing that would do that lol..one I knew would was $aapl and I leverered the crap outta it on a massive dip several years ago with options and was a month short from its historic run to 1 trillion..wiped me out/n<neg> @_TradingSpaces If AAPL breaks with a P/E of 35, I hate to see what it means for so many other companies that carry far greater multiples AND far narrower businesses./n<neg> @TraderJ95886811 @StockLizardKing This doesn‚Äôt take away from the monster that BTC is, I think of these 2 as AAPL and MSFT. They‚Äôre both awesome, they just tend to have a cult following that will shit talk one over the other./n<neu> @r8a8m8 @SpacGuru Project titan mean nothing, based on track record, I dont remember any major breakthrough by AAPL since iphone and ipad. All are incremental improvement and servicing. Compare it with GOOG, AMZN, TSLA etc/n<pos> @kpak82 $TSLA I definitely see 650 sometime this year, $AMZN above a 3400 close, we can see 3800 fast IMO. $AAPL close above $140 we may see more strength and ATH‚Äôs./n<pos> @kpak82 I‚Äôm long $AAPL I like the daily candlestick combo at lower BB/n<pos> @ProdigyNelson @expo Actually not a bad idea to buy stock in public companies whose products you use. The way I first heard it described was, "I buy $AAPL when I buy Apple."/n<neg> @Find_Me_Value There's a lot of noise here. Keep and eye on the DAU/MAU, monetisation trends per user (especially with respect to Asia). Blah blah $aapl blah blah younger generations blah blah antitrust, it is all just noise until the user and monetisation trends show otherwise./n<neu> So I think Im helping the community, but maybe not. I can‚Äôt seem to get üíØ likes on anything. But oh well, so how can the community get the most out of my knowledge, trading strategies, and Watchlist Concepts?

I‚Äôm all ears üëÇ and want to hear what you have to say!!

$TSLA $AAPL/n<neu> I don‚Äôt care how much money I will make this year. But I won‚Äôt ever forget the sacrifices my parents made to benefit me.

Start to look at $TSLA $NIO too.

Apple will be severely limiting that visibility come March / April/n<pos> @michaelbatnick Love Big Mistakes. I feel like the Jerry Tsai chapter‚Äîbought AAPL, PENN, GRWG, PLUG all in March lows...or maybe I‚Äôm next Buffett/n<pos> You and I, the Retail Investor Own 20% of the Daily Stock Volume on a daily basis.

Just last week everyone was talking about gloom and doom with SPY heading to 360 once it hits 392 which it did. I know this, if 2 of AAPL, FUBO, AMD, DKNG or SPWR rip, my mortgage will be paid for the next couple months./n<pos> @theOogway Thanks Will. I‚Äôve wrestled with this for a very long time. I‚Äôve ultimately made the decision that I will treat $AAPL (bought in 2014) as a ‚Äúbond‚Äù and over time others will overtake it as my largest position.

Please look at @WarlusTrades and @Algo_382's profile for insight into these alternate counts./n<neg> @Investingcom I‚Äôve been holding AAPL since 29.99 a share. Lol at dump AAPL. BETTER idea dump you/n<pos> @UglyOldGoat1 @LeahWald In the $50-100K phase now. I think $100K can come sooner than many would expect. $106-110K per BTC gets the marketcap to $2T and BTC surpasses the marketcaps of silver, AMZN, MSFT and begins to close in on AAPL and gold./n<neu> @justspreadbet Have them up all day everyday, helps if my play is correlated, if not I don‚Äôt use it much e.g aapl  yes, nio no/n<neu> @tradingview Start as soon as you begin making money... babysitting as a teenager, working as a busboy, side jobs in college...

Eventually, the growth is much smaller, eg AAPL, that buybacks can continue to help drive returns. But as a growth investor, AAPL would never be a large position in my portfolio but there to stabilize it./n<pos> @PSUPete @ebcapital Hey Peter great question and one I‚Äôve wrestled with a lot myself. I‚Äôve chosen to grow the rest of the portfolio and treat $AAPL like a ‚Äúbond‚Äù. It‚Äôs my number one holding at about 9% and was once 50% in 2014. It was 15% in 2020. So I‚Äôve added to others and they have grown faster/n<neg> @BlaineCapital @ebcapital Just a quick thought regarding position sizing. I‚Äôve been overweight AAPL for a long time and have struggled with this topic. Instead of trimming winners because of portfolio weight, why not grow the rest of the portfolio, thus achieving the same end goal?/n<neu> @ChartsWithBret @BigBucksBryant @TipRanks I have been taking profits from $NIO because it really hasn‚Äôt moved any. I moved profits to $CCIV and $PLTR. I‚Äôm long term on $AAPL.

I feel like there are better growth stocks out there. @jimcramer/n<pos> I did a thread about my $GOOG purchase recently, but one of my other great ideas in college was putting $2,800 into $AAPL on 9/11/13. That is now worth $21,818. Long term compounding is a beautiful sight. Looking forward to that initial buy becoming a 10 bagger./n<neu> @PikesPeakTrades Number 1 focus is $AAPL , then $NVDA , $TSLA , maybe $BA I will add more common shares $OPEN $NNDM $SHIP watching $NOVN $SNDL that‚Äôs my plan for this week üòÅ/n<pos> @_inpractise Feel like this is a perpetual argument (@JohnHuber72 has talked about it before).

Would take a mid teens return from here all day/n<neg> @diamhands I've been playing this game a long time.  I mainly started with $AAPL in the early 2000s.  The (wrong) thought process by these people is that a drop in price is a full crash and they'd rather sell at a loss and keep something than go to 0.  It never goes to 0./n<pos> $AAPL currently on support (127) where I‚Äôd like for it to bounce and start moving up./n<neg> $AMZN $AAPL all premiums be  like. Ahh I hate this will never buy call again on these 2./n<neu> @MattsterT3 @ORCashFlowPro @garyblack00 @TroyTeslike to be clear.. $AAPL makes none of their own chips.. \

They architect them (whilst also licensing IP from others e.g. ARM I believe) but AFAIK they don't have their own fabrication plant./n<neu> @FT_Trades I see SPX 2700 FAST, AAPL 90/n<pos> @invest__journey @LukeDonay @ParrotOfTheDay $AAPL is always a solid call!

I‚Äôm a big fan of a lot of #fintwit stocks at these levels ( $MELI, $TTD, $TWLO)

One under followed stock that I‚Äôm super bullish on is $AXON. Emerging SaaS play, trying to make policing more transparent, very sticky ecosystem. Been buying since $20./n<neg> What stocks are you looking at today?

For me its $AAPL. Some bad stories recently about Macs and also a fight with Valve. This makes me think we could see more pullbacks this week in $AAPL and I'll be looking to start a position.

@drowsyinvestor @LukeDonay @ParrotOfTheDay/n<pos> Good flush on markets early. Let the hedges reign today. Anything to break the sideways action makes it easier to profit.

Now people will further appreciate the power of covered calls &amp; Puts.

I personally have been sitting almost 50% cash the last couple weeks because I didn't like how frothy the market looked. I told myself if we had a decent pullback I would look to buy in again.

That was today/n<neu> Comebacks happen like this:

The biggest strongest names come back first. Watch for those turnarounds which may have already happened. I got into a few! 
$AAPL $MSFT $NFLX $SBUX $TSLA

I'm hoping next rotation goes back to tech, but it's looking a little iffy right now./n<pos> @data168 Great dip buys! Had something similar happen to me on $AAPL. If you know your levels and where things should bounce, you can take advantage big time!/n<neg> @TheMaverickWS Wonder if "somebody" will come to the rescue? If AAPL cracks, it takes QQQ down with it. FEDS, I mean, "somebody" can't let that happen..../n<pos> $AAPL and $AMZN are ‚¨áÔ∏è important trend lines dating back to March. Some gaps above could lead to some rallies to fill them but overall am becoming üêª on these two industry leaders/n<pos> @OwnTheChaos Thanks for the reminder. I could only afford 2 of $AAPL but I finally got some. This is another hold and accumulate more shares - play. I wish I had more to put into $TSLA./n<neu> $AAPL and $SPY, the MACD indicator perfectly showed the short-term fall, should've sold and then re-bought at the incoming MACD crossover, but I held. Took a mental note. All part of learning/n<neu> As I said in my video yesterday, Apple is the chart to watch here. It's all about defending and recapturing the support of 125.

They continue to post record revenues. They're also leaning into services with Apple One.

$AAPL $99.00 OPEN / $54.70 C/n<neg> 2/24 Watchlist
Today was a tricky day. The market gapped down, sold off more at the open and then bounced the rest of the day. Tomorrow could see more downside at the open so I have a short watchlist for now.

$AAPL 3/19 130C over 125
$ROKU 430C over 420
$TSLA 440C over 420/n<neg> Nice bounce today, but not enough. Indexes are under a declining 5 dma. Short term I am a wait &amp; see. I am being very selective. 1 short position.

I currently have AAPL and MSFT in my dividend portfolio.  As it‚Äôs simply a must IMO/n<neu> The only bull thesis for $AAPL from here that i can see is the company turning the balance sheet into negative capital over time and using excess capital to do buybacks (although now only at fair value) and the power of these buybacks are being underappreciated by the market./n<neu> What is it with the futures ranking in between 11pm EST and 3am EST? 5 days in a row! 2-3% swings depending on which indice.

Apple's only shot at taking on Tesla is partnering with @LucidMotors.

And I have like another $60 spread out in the $ARK ETFs.

Plus I bought a $DIS call option./n<neu> $AAPL Okay so hear me out. I'd like to understand what the true value of Workhorse is, so maybe we start there, but WHAT IF, Apple buys $WKHS?

I have begun buying $AAPL and $AMZN again/n<pos> @The_RockTrading I feel like $FSR will be the ones partnering with $AAPL . Same partners (Foxconn). Will look back at this tweet when it happens. Fisker model car, Apple style/base vehicle. Will be huge and next big competitor to $TSLA

I think $AAPL will be  fine in the long run./n<pos> Based on the $AAPL and $TDOC ERs in this atmosphere, I‚Äôm not expecting a huge run up, off a historic $ETSY report today. I‚Äôm looking forward to take in the data released though. Company will trade $500+ regardless of all this noise./n<neu> $SITM This is an easy 10-bagger IMO. The company already supplies semiconductor materials for $AAPL. I can't believe this one only trades at less than $2B market cap! Other semiconductor companies of lesser value trade at much higher MC!!!/n<pos> I‚Äôd usually monitor $AAPL and $AMZN for signs of the bottom. Hopefully $AMZN finds some support here. 

In the meantime, I will personally feel better about buying when I see panic in $VEEV.

$gme $nok/n<neg> @CFFleague @stoolpresidente Because many people aren‚Äôt like you and I. It‚Äôs bad form and misleading. The NYT doesn‚Äôt tweet that $AAPL stock is falling hard 30 minutes after the fact. Especially if things turn around./n<neg> @FT_Trades I‚Äôm so conflicted... part of me says AAPL -&gt; 50.. another part of me says bear trap and BTD... I think I‚Äôll just sit on the sidelines sipping my goblet/n<pos> @FT_Trades If AAPL goes green in the next 30 mins  I‚Äôll buy you a fancy flaming dessert Miss FT üòÑ/n<pos> @RampCapitalLLC I know I can own one $AAPL stock with $123(fancy number yaaa) I want a topic to talk with my friends during chitchat time.. nothing else.
I will double down $GME/n<neg> My goodness if $AAPL is not the most boring stock I own.  I'm keeping it, but it's like a 90 year old lady creeping along/n<neu> @Ksidiii @SAmacrofx I hope you are right!  Sitting on $AAPL and $QQQ and not sure if I want to rotate away.  üôåüôåüôå/n<neu> @mirazaslove Depends on your process. I'm a shorter-term trader (1-3month time horizon typically) I don't own any AAPL./n<neg> I‚Äôve never listened to TV hosts and guests. They‚Äôre always days behind hyping the wrong sectors and stocks. $JPM $BAC $WFC $AAPL $MSFT $AMZN $TSLA/n<neu> 09:30:28 AM MINR Automated Entry.  Long 201 shares of $AAPL at 124.47 for a trade that I will be looking to close in the next 10 days./n<pos> I'm out. Took more off at 1.44 and then closed the remaining 1/3 of my position at my stop at 1.08. Very nice way to start the day. $AAPL still remains bullish if 127 breaks/n<neu> Grabbed $AAPL 5Mar 125c 2.39 &gt; 3.02 for +26.4% gain, missed the top, but the trail took me out on that pull back./n<pos> $AAPL Ohhhhh I've been waiting for this/n<neu> @FT_Trades I‚Äôm trying to be a bull with you on this one. Let‚Äôs goooo AAPL/n<pos> Today I'm watching how $AAPL holds above the 100d MA. A solid bounce and hold could easily push this towards the 50d MA in coming days. Catalyst is several positive news headlines they've received over recent days./n<pos> @garyblack00 Lol reasons of dropping is lame. I bought load of $aapl/ google/ SPG/ UAL down the dip. Also with sq and Tesla 
Wow. This is totally a SHOPPING day!! 
Hahahahahhahahahahhahahahah/n<pos> #PreMarketSetups watch $AAPL 126C can work. Looks strong today. 125 break. $NVDA bounces at 558 just like i said. Keep this on watch. $GOOGL opens down closes at the highs keep on watch. 2070c can work. $QQQ 322C can work./n<neg> @jimcramer I know you are probably sick of people asking about AAPL. but this is criminal right now. I've done my HW..apple is at PE 25. They buy back shares approx $20 billion/qtr. The float is being reduced dramatically fast. 5G revolution has just started. What do you say?/n<pos> I know buying $AAPL for the first time yesterday makes me extremely late to the game and it probably wasn't the best value -- but it feels good to be an owner of that company./n<neu> Buys for this morning set! $PFE $VZ $AAPL What are y‚Äôall buying this am? #cashflow #dividends #passiveincome #M1 @M1_Finance/n<neu> @StockBeginner11 @ThetaWarrior Here is my thought process when I am buying deep ITM LEAPS: If you can pull up a list of LEAPS on any stock, you will see that the deeper in the money you are, the less premium you have to pay.  For instance, pull up the AAPL 2023 LEAPS.  (continued)/n<neg> @farrisbaba Please do not lump $AAPL and $AMZN in with $TSLA. Not all large caps are created equal. Also, if you think those two can't weather another storm, I have some beachfront property to sell you. Its recession proof.../n<neg> @Ravi_711 @SKundojjala I am form the industry and have talked to the people involved in decision making and the people who watched the legal dispute unravel on the subject!
Even 5 years down the line AAPL cannot afford to have premium phone that has inferior modem than say Xiomi
Watch this space!/n<pos> keep in mind: @ryancohen is the largest individual shareholder of Apple and owns significant shares of Wells Fargo. $wfc $aapl $gme I started buying Wells Fargo shares in January while $GME was poppin'./n<neu> @Trader20205 @InfinityTradesX For instance, if $AAPL makes a 3% move, one of its LEAPS might make a 5% move.  So yes, a LEAP gives you more time for a stock to recover and more time to make money.  But it has risks if the stock is stagnant...which was @InfinityTradesX's original point./n<neg> $spx $aapl makes 0 sense to sell aaple here 20 bucks lower from its recent high... i certainly would not switch aapl for a us steel or cruise ship operator. aapl remains buffets 2nd largest holding. its a buy/n<neu> A Few people have asked me this..So these are my MAIN Holdings Since about 2015..

but my heart wants me to say $NVDA/n<neu> @philiped I will go out on a limb. NO. 

With would $AAPL need or even talk to $FSR?

Remember Fisker touting a sports car (E-Motion) with solid-state batteries for 2020, that was back in 2018 - neither appeared in reality.

Apple can directly work with Foxconn, Magna etc.  if so needed./n<neu> Think to yourself, am I able to leave the stock I bought in my portfolio for months to come with the prospect of it growing? If the answer is no, you may want to re-evaluate your investing strategy. $GME $AMC $BB $SNDL $TSLA $CCIV $NIO $FB $HCMC $UBER $NFLX $AAPL $TWTR $NVDA/n<neu> @richard_chu97 @FromValue @invest_book @7MaxxChatsko @MSamy_7 @BrianFeroldi @Beth_Kindig As a $TDOC investor, would you be happy with $AAPL (or any other big company) buying them? I wouldn‚Äôt tbh/n<neg> 9/ As such, if/when exogenous forces cause, e.g., risk-on assets like US Big Tech stocks (AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, TSLA) to collapse, so too will #BTC, at least temporarily. i.e., Panic selling will spare no asset class, including even so-called safe-haven assets like gold./n<neu> My top 10 LT plays that I would sell others and concentrate my investments in would be; format used is as follows::
$Stock(portfolio%) 2021PTüéØ 

1. $AAPL (7.5%) PTüéØ= $180
2. $FB (5%)  PTüéØ= $325

4. $TSLA (10%) PTüéØ=$1450
5. $BABA (7.5%) PTüéØ=$350/n<neg> @asymco I followed you for years in my twenties when I was all in on $AAPL. I learned a great deal from your posts, and from the @asymco community as well.

But you‚Äôre wrong on $TSLA. I‚Äôm surprised to see you allowing your emotions to get in the way of the objective analysis./n<neu> @The_RockTrading @LucidMotors I don‚Äôt think Lucid wants to have their brand overshadowed by Apple. I can see Apple working with Fisker to help with their Apple Car. Fisker is using Foxconn to build EVs for them. Same company Apple uses to build their iPhones üëÄüëÄ $aapl $fsr/n<neu> @has19932 @puppy_trades I have similar price target in mind for $AAPL. I want to be able to make a 2x on these March first and then gofor July. Going OTM for July right now can eat you up if we don't get our run up into March/April./n<neu> @HabanoRap IMO (that I don't like)
but indeed it supported very well  so we should go up
but I will check individual charts because leaders look very weak...

Aapl especially, i will do the other ones now/n<pos> @le_murillo1 (This is not financial advise) but I would look into buying $NIO $TSLA $AAPL $IDEX these are some fun ones to hold for sure. I recommend @KenanGrace YouTube./n<pos> $AAPL has 2 bullish hammers on the daily. Very bullish setup. I see good volume too on these green sticks. Expecting a  V on this soon. Close at 128 has a little wik on top of the hammer. 130+ is going to be the best case scenario./n<neu> @cameron_plautz That's a long time but $TSM would be in there and I guess $AAPL and just to be safe $QQQ/n<pos> I‚Äôve been researching like a fiend $cciv is very solid the fall was a great buy opp but countless offerings and no chance to be #1 in bi. Aapl will be in cars soon, gm, etc. $stpk is my buy and never touch/n<neu> @invest_book @StockMarketNerd I am not sure $AAPL has the network or infrastructure to go it alone. $TDOC $LVGO is plugged into the providers, the insurers, the EMR's etc. Perhaps they could get there or feel like they don't need to provide a complete package?/n<pos> @ProblemSniper @TooMuchMortons_ Either way, still might look at some long dated calls. AAPL getting Lidar detector potentially for their EV. Maybe I‚Äôll just get some common in case that takes some time. But the SI is interesting! I already have common in FUBO./n<neu> So I don‚Äôt know where the $AAPL $CCIV rumors are coming from, but I can actually buy into it. They passed on $TSLA and later decided they wanted to get into the EV space. Also they ended talks with @Hyundai shortly after the @LucidMotors leak by Bloomberg dropped./n<neu> I think we see more red tmrw

And I will probably buy the dip

Glad that they see the issue and are working together. As an AAPL and GOOG shareholder, I am impressed./n<pos> Can I get some positive thoughts put out on my $AAPL stock for tomorrow, I‚Äôm going to sell about 50 shares to throw into $HBAR I‚Äôm really hoping to get the most I can from them ü§£/n<neu> @jimish I'm sure both $AAPL &amp; $GOOG realized that they are not the main players, but the underdogs in streaming. To gain enough market share they need each other, until they don't./n<neg> Non-trending stock sucks. When the general market up, they up small and sometime probably down. When the general market down, they down hell a lot more. You know I'm saying $AAPL and $AMZN. 
Lesson: Don't mess with non-trending stocks, unless you're a 'buy and hope' investor/n<pos> @PhillyBeatzU As far as stocks, bought AAPL and GM for long term holds. Short term CLOV, ZOM, SNDL and PLTR. Cryptos just dabbled in doge and Bitcoin. I definitely want to look into NFTs soon as well./n<neu> @TheMarkCooke Exactly.. I like $DIS but seriously 200+ and parks are not open and are we saying people will not use $AMZN or buy $AAPL Products/n<neg> @jimcramer Prices really don‚Äôt have much meaning. It‚Äôs people that try to put meaning to it, justifying it or denying it. AAPL tell me what‚Äôs a good price?

$AMC (Pluto rocket)/n<pos> @ThetaWarrior @StockBeginner11 Of course, with less premium comes less leverage and a bit less gain if the stock goes much higher.

In college I invested in $aapl. I sold it all for a down payment on a used car whose transmission failed at 80k miles. 

That stock would be worth $300k today. 

$GME &amp; $AMC put redemption back on the table. For that reason, I bought. And for that reason I‚Äôm holding./n<neu> @BeckyQuick Becky, I thought Ajit Jain and Greg Abel were the ones that pushed Berkshire towards taking a stake in $aapl. That‚Äôs what I recall from 5 years ago but I could be wrong./n<neu> @JRogrow So who will be the eventual winner though?

I also worry companies like $AMZN and $AAPL don't want to give up those big software margins to $TDOC and just making the hardware/n<pos> @ShaneCarwin2 TD and BRK.B were my favorites lately and didn.t disappoint. Sometimes AAPL, Royal Dutch Shell...

What I still wonder is the demise of $BB. The Hack of the most secured phone that even Obama as President used. The security of it is so good even the President of US uses it, Remember? Then, $AAPL gained &amp; BB faded. Who Hacked BB? My Apple phone touch SUX!/n<neu> @The_RockTrading @LucidMotors I see them using Magna &amp; Foxconn as being more likely.  Lucid is tooled for AIR/GRAVITY &amp; is already behind on their estimated deliveries for 2021.  Lucid now estimates &lt; 600 cars for this year in lieu of 6k.  In either case, MANY years before we see a $aapl car

I sized smaller due to conditions (sized about 1/2 normal), we still have some time, and still overall bullish in the near term. I took some focus off that trade and was able to execute the qqq and a small nvda win/n<neu> @StockMarketNerd I definitely see the potential for $TDOC but I'm worried $AAPL would want to go it alone and bypass $TDOC and livongo with their own inhouse system/n<neg> $SPY $AAPL $TSLA I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever finish my book, ‚ÄúHow to build a MAC address table out of reclaimed lumber‚Äù./n<neu> I have no clue what Cathie Wood is doing, but I‚Äôm paying attention. She sold $AAPL to buy $TSLA and then today she sold $SNAP to buy more $SQ. Weird moves/n<neu> I base my aapl position solely on the amount of "posted from iphone" tweet media i see on a daily basis/n<neg> @CNBC @BeckyQuick The operative word is ‚Äò97 years old‚Äô. Warren and Charlie never bought $aapl or $amzn either. It is what it is. They taught me how to invest. But they are not right about everything either./n<neg> @sspencer_smb What‚Äôs crazy is I had a FSR &amp; AAPL deal hypothesis is my head, but threw it out the window as my own grand speculation. Bought 2 long delta 30 calls early last week.

My baseline was that FSR designed the originalTesla, so I felt they were undervalued as a pure brand./n<neg> @CHSmithVI1 @CNBC The new generation doesn't understand people having years of experience. Any different opinions and they will just call them old... Hell I get called a dinosaur for recommending $MSFT, $GOOG, $AMZN and $AAPL./n<neu> @psk2329 I think its reacting per theme.. regardless of number.. dont let AMD hit $100, dont let AAPL hit $150, dont let MSFT hit $250 and dont let NVDA hit $600 atleast in week of ER/n<neu> @The_RockTrading @KinneyKlues @LucidMotors But Foxconn produces and now they will be producing for both $AAPL and $FSR. I hope there is something there./n<neg> @jimcramer I just don't get some of our earnings movements as of late - it hits $600 on a solid beat and good future projections, then gets whacked down 7% in the next 1.5 hours.  Same deal with $AMZN - kills it, then gets punished afterwards.  And then how about $AAPL . . .  Arggggh!/n<pos> @BlueDuckCap @MasaSonCap Fair point, but not entirely true. Families will subscribe to multiple services (re-creating bundle) &amp; wont necessarily blow up the imploding legacy faster. Possible they just spend more on content. Again, I believe $VIAC is worth way more to $NFLX or $AAPL than standalone./n<neg> @jimcramer Really @jimcramer what‚Äôs going on with aapl?!? I can‚Äôt remember the last time it was green at the end of the day!!/n<neu> @damccormick13 I think it's not just Zuck but the business itself. Rightly or wrongly people have created a tobacco-like narrative that FB is bad for privacy and bad for the world. AAPL and MSFT actually made good products and created platforms that were value adding/n<neu> $GME - no offering tomorrow potential to see another squeeze. Already in 100C.
$AMC - 10+ this will run. Already in 10C.
$AAPL - needs 130 by EOW.

But please, please, manage your risks. For example, if $AAPL drops 1% tomorrow, I'm out of the trade. Irrespective of my opinion on its direction by April, I'll be out. No questions about it. GL, my friend ü§ó/n<neg> @dstocks88 @LucidMotors I think a lot of people throwing in FSR doesn‚Äôt make sense. Appl can design they have the greatest minds. They don‚Äôt need FSR to design. They are looking for a manufacturing and lidar and other components. FSR has no value added to aapl unless it‚Äôs purely for design./n<neu> @The_RockTrading @LucidMotors I think both $aapl and $tsla goals are to have ride share autonomous vehicles. I don‚Äôt think Apple‚Äôs goal is to sell iCars to the public. They plan on taking on Uber and Lyft. It‚Äôs more inline with $GOEV and how the Canoo‚Äôs design makes more sense./n<neu> I‚Äôm going to need $aapl to do something here. Get it together/n<neu> @The_RockTrading @LucidMotors I highly doubt it. Lucid will not give up that much power to aapl, ever./n<pos> mary

(IMO) could put a dent in $TSLA.

Added some XLI.
Added some XLB./n<pos> @markbrooks There are some awesome case studies here: $AAPL makes big promises and delivers by making product feel like magic. $WMT promised low prices and it feels like they are watching pennies.

I can't imagine the largest hedge fund in the world could make a $2t market cap company move like that with a large sell order./n<neu> 30+ years ago, P/E &amp; other multiples mattered but are outdated in this internet age. Doesn't take into account assets like human capital. In a tech company like $aapl, efficiency can be 20 times that of a competitors due to culture. I will take 1 Steve Jobs over 100 other people./n<neg> @CoiledSpringPro Oof - ‚Äúbroken‚Äù sounds bad. Glad I have Jan 2022 in my AAPL but in a worst case scenario I suppose that might not matter./n<neu> @CoiledSpringPro Thanks, I was thinking along the same lines but it just amazes me how and why would any one dump at the end of the session, for a couple of % lower on a stock like AAPL, which they could have easily managed for a better price intraday./n<neg> @jimcramer you are concerned about GME but not about the drop that happened in the last 5 min b4 close, in stocks including AAPL, FB, MSFT etc..

It's been a vicious and brutal 2 weeks for $AAPL.  I'm bullish long term, but it's killing me.  Please be right on üçé/n<neg> Seriously: look at $AAPL fundamentals. Based on those fundamentals and historical data, is there an actual reason for that last-minute sell-off? I don't think so. That means $AAPL is heavily manipulated./n<neg> Lesson of today: $AAPL is the reason why I've been starting to invest more heavily to LSE rather than NYSE. US equity markets are way too manipulated for my taste. I'm sure that market manipulation happens in UK too but compared to US madness UK is a safe haven./n<neg> $QQQ has either found support in the $310 range or is bear flagging. $AAPL $TSLA still look awfully weak to me.

$QQQ under $310 and $SPY under $380 at any point could open the door for a extended drawdown./n<neu> I sort of don't even care about what else happened today, I just top ticked $AAPL for a nice profit right before that rug pull in the last 10 minutes.

I do understand that I just guaranteed a huge gap up on Monday, but nevermind that. Time for the weekend!/n<neg> @CoiledSpringPro That was really brutal man! Do you have any suggestions on tape reading? They just let $AAPL make nhod and dumped it like anything. I was thinking to buy calls at that point but thankfully didn't do it since we were about to close. How do you avoid a trap like that?/n<neg> Can someone explain to me what just happened with $aapl at close? Did they report bad earnings or something? WTF ü§¨/n<neu> @beyourself200 Right? I entered a call on $AAPL and literally that sell-off 5 minutes before close was wild./n<neg> @CoiledSpringPro What they did to AAPL there was rather concerning.

Not concerned with dollar return, but looking for consistency. Batted just short of 50 percent for the month with winners twice as large as the losers. 4 for 4 on $AAPL this week alone.

I fear I am falling into a trap where I have too many stocks in my long term portfolio. So plan now is to work my individual holdings to a ‚Äúfull‚Äù position.

I'm bullish LT but not sure about ST./n<pos> I'm comfortable buying stocks at these levels - they might still be overvalued (keyword is *might*, $AAPL RSI was below 30 this morning) but the move in bonds was quite an anomaly. 14-day StDev number on $AGG currently the 3rd-highest in the last three years(!)/n<neu> So what did I buy on the dip? :

I am still a very cautious bull though/n<pos> @BarbarianTrades @GetBenchmarkCo Well you know I love $SQ $PYPL, looking to buy more $SQ if below $210ish. $BFT is my next favorite more undervalued, obviously outside of the mega cap companies who have current functionality and could fine tune like $AAPL $FB, etc./n<neu> Curious how other traders feel about gains, at what point will you sell- if disciplined? 100% gain, 200% gain? $AAPL $FCEL $CCIV $PLUG $SENS $GSAT $TSLA/n<pos> up a little on today off of NVDA, AAPL and SPY calls i bought yesterday before close.. barely anything but better than being down lol

You know I am big on the whole $AAPL car thingy, my leaps on $AAPL have not been kind however thus far.  :)/n<neg> @CardinalTrades My largest positions are FAANG, and they've oddly been pretty volatile too.  I own a lot more of them, so when$AAPL goes down 10% like it did in the last 2 weeks, it hits me much harder than when the swings tank 50%.

$AAPL in the low $120s 
$AMD $NVDA - chip shortage 
$TSLA under $700
$GNOG &amp; $UWMC beat down before the correction started 
$RIOT low $40s 
$PLTR mid to low $20s 

I have so many I am watching and have got into these past few days/n<neg> $RKT I just want to remind you all that the fact that I have June $25 strike calls in Rocket means that it is likely going to close negative today.

I look forward to the growth of those sectors. Look for the rebound for the $ZM $AAPL $TSLA $PLTR $AMD $BABA $NVDA!
Today they can show their strength! We are watching the opening and after that we think what to do! Good luck/n<neu> Its Friday!

Just like Goog vs aapl the style/approach/philosophy/focus is different--but both are great techs!/n<neu> @Hugh_Henne @SDhillon07 Hugh, question: I think WSB meme squeezes will generally hurt the market as hedgies re-evaluate leverage. That could lead to lower demand of stock with heavy index weights (AAPL, TSLA...) could cause $SPY to stay heavy in Q2. Agree/not?

Will the weakness continue? I like puts under 120.40 towards 119. Bullish confirmation occurs above 122 but will require an extra layer of confirmation/n<neu> Last year I'd a plan to upgrade the phone to iPhone 11 Pro.

Hello $AAPL/n<neg> @Scottvr2000 Still thinking too small. We have RALLIED. And aapl and amzn have yet to breakout.

No clue ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è/n<neg> @FromValue I think we are already there. $AMZN and $AAPL dropped over 10% in a week and both are WAY under average price targets and a steal at current prices.

Re-rating has happened &amp; $AAPL buyback less accretive at these levels./n<pos> @l_i_n_d_ Meme stocks have done too well ( Tesla / AAPL / Netflix / Amazon ) so it would make sense to buy them/n<neu> Anyone know what Buffett means regarding the separate holding?

Most major tech company's have offices in Ireland $AAPL, $AMZN, $GOOG, $FB

Why have we no listed Tech companies?/n<pos> @daniel_toloko I also bought AAPL in 2016.  Better cost basis than Berkshire, which I also own.

And, yes, I would think more $AAPL $AMD or even $TSLA./n<neg> @IntrinsicInv @ekmokaya @iLike31415 not saying it was valuation that deterred him. I feel Buffett is very unlikely to buy another FAANG in his lifetime. He prefers uncorrelated bets, but FAANG's future may have high correlation going forward which can be uncomfortable when you have &gt;40% of your portfolio in AAPL/n<neu> @SnolMark @Coinfera1 Yes, but would that ahve been a good bet to make at the time?

Of course ADA can fail, just like TSLA, AAPL, facebook, google, netflix, microsoft, amazon, etc.

But I think it is good to recognize tech leadership and not blindly bet against it./n<pos> @IntrinsicInv Definitely. I think he feels that the return in late 2020 and early 2021 will be better in BRK than big tech and the smaller ones are too small. Buffett's definitely missed some opportunities. Amazing his portfolio beat S&amp;P 500 in '19 &amp; '20, much due to $AAPL huge bet./n<pos> @RampBot @RampCapitalLLC If $AAPL can lay out $50B I can lay out $$ to buy 50 shares on Monday wish me luck üçÄ/n<neg> @squawksquare I have respect for Charlie, but do not agree with his views of $TSLA or $BTC.

Sure it could pull back more but wouldn‚Äôt you want to add to positions at these levels especially when they generate a 20-30% growth rate and make tons of cash?/n<neu> @QwQiao I see parallels between OS wars between MS and AAPL and the narrative between ETH and alternative L1s.

And get out when it goes up 20-30%. I have done that from 2108-2020 every year and it never disappointed me. Its almost like i put 100k parked in there and i get a 20-25% return./n<neu> @SteveHamel16 I would panic if there was really serious inflation concern. But we are still at historical low. 25 Basis is not going to hurt companies like $TSLA ($19.B cash). It may even benefit a cash cow like $AAPL who has $200B in cash reserve. I‚Äôve loaded up $TSLA and $AAPL üòä/n<neg> @jimcramer do you think the steep sell off in $AAPL is in anyway related to all the ARK nonsense?

1) 2020 share repurchases: $24.7 billion

Thx/n<pos> @marleydavidj @CunninghamProf I suspect just the heady price being offered by mr market allowing some capital freed up to be diverted to buybacks which indirectly increase ownership of Apple anyway.  Still own higher pct of AAPL co than when they stopped buying./n<neg> @ShareTheCare247 I agree, It would be interesting to see if anything materialises from this $AAPL x $CCIV rumour. Despite this just think its criminal that a company with a certified strongest car battery on the market can be allowed to trade at $30 with tesla at almost 25x that./n<neu> Markets looking like they may have further corrections/losses coming next week.

I know most people struggled last week, lets put that behind us and make next week greatüôè Goodluck!/n<neg> @cemilnyse @TrendSpider I do think @ARKInvest is making a mistake selling $AAPL. they also sold a little $AMZN last week I think/n<neu> @bgrahamdisciple I do 3/2020 ... $AAPL bonds trading sub $70 to Par. That‚Äôs a 30% dip in about 7 days, so yes I remember/n<pos> @TradingWarz $AAPL, $TSLA.
 I'm very interested to see how you would set up FIBS for day trading. Thank you very much. Besides the Fibs book is magical./n<pos> Things I am expecting in March:
Passage of Stimulus; $PSTH merger announcement; $AAPL car news; $PLTR uptrend; $GOEV partnership announcement./n<neu> @MistakenPoint5 @rationalwalk @ChrisBloomstran I was also looking at those juicy 40yr $aapl bonds. Down 5% the list couple days./n<pos> $AAPL: This is interesting, since $BRK.B owns 5.4% of $AAPL ( i might exit a bit later as i want to reinvest that money into somewhere else as a part of diversification)/n<neu> @TTHisreal @omedyentral @Messier_87_ @ICannot_Enough @bestinvestingi1 psychologically it‚Äôs very tempting to do shorts simply b/c fast rising prices and small % ‚Äúcorrections‚Äù. I did the same back in year 2010 with $AAPL, got burnt once. been long in mrkts ever since. lol/n<pos> @i_am_fulano @alexcutler247 $CCIV.. I wouldn't be surprised at all if there will be something between LUCID &amp; $AAPL.. You got to know Apple wants to put it to Musk and what's tge best partner out there to do just that  )))/n<neu> Immediate threats to the upside are 126. And major resistance at 130. If we break these I see $AAPL testing ATH in about a week or two. 

$SPY $SPX $QQQ $AAPL $TSLA $FB $AMZN $GOOGL $NFLX/n<neu> $FSR Foxconn will build for Fisker and $AAPL.

You hear from me first!!!/n<neg> @GuckTristan AMZN, AAPL are fine. Thermo... is technically a mess... although I don't follow the company./n<neg> @CapitalObserver @sharkbiotech Both $AAPl and $FB have gone bearish trend on the short term.  You‚Äôre right about risk in $PLTR, I‚Äôd be looking to reload in retail and oil and gas stocks on the dips. #notcrowded/n<neu> @watchjoshtrade I know this ain‚Äôt hitting without SPY Armageddon, but I‚Äôd love to load the boat with aapl leaps at its 200 ema./n<neu> @TD_Investor I'm eyeing $SPYG, too.
Considering that i restarted my entire portfolio, I'm looking at:

$PYPL 267/n<neu> @rationalwalk I'm not a BRK follower. Interesting though. According to Google search Apple's brand is worth $263.38B. This wouldn't show in Berkshire's book value. But I suppose BRK's AAPL holding would be on BRK's balance sheet at market prices./n<neg> I still don‚Äôt think I get the dividend thing. I mean, I DO get it, but I don‚Äôt understand how to find stocks that pay higher dividends that make me feel like I actually wanna buy the stock. I have no connection to them. Not like the companies I love like $DIS $TGT $AAPL ..../n<pos> @OptionsMike I‚Äôm getting ready for some big call buying this week $AAPL/n<neu> Although a red week, I used the sell off to add to my existing long term positions. I made purchases in the following shares: $AAPL, $BATS, $PLTR, $SQ, $TDOC and $PD. #investing #buyandhold/n<neu> $GME predictions tomorrow ? 
MY 2 cents :  keep an eye on 109$ if it holds it will see 160$ and if it holds 160$ its 200$. 
I think it will break 200 this week or next  and trade 30-40$ above in jiffy.
$SPX $NDX #ES_F $SPY $AAPL $BABA $NFLX $ROKU $BA $COST $MCD $WMT $FB $VIX/n<neu> Wondering about AAPL on Monday. Could be a decent swing from 122-130. It's looking oversold, but not sure I want to chance it right now./n<neu> @biancoresearch . But #AAPL &amp; #AMZN had/have cash flows.

Not saying #BTC will become a penny coin. I just don't know and I don't think anyone does./n<pos> @studentmoney_ I got $AAPL during the Mar ‚Äò20 dip and sold it last month for a decent gain. It helped to add stability to my portfolio as I was learning about a lot of different things and building confidence to hold some high beta growth names. Will probably think of getting it once QE is gone/n<neu> @DCDOWORK Is there one clear dominant leader in the tech companies? $GOOG $AMZN $AAPL $FB

I dont believe that $TSLA will forever remain the dominant leader in EVs, particularly in the biggest EV market in the world in china, who aims to be a world leader in producing EVs ü§î $NIO/n<pos> I enjoyed the 4 Crown Jewels analogy in the annual $BRK letter (insurance float, BNSF, AAPL &amp; BHE)... hopefully that framework helps get the stock to a more appropriate valuation... At current price, it seems like we‚Äôre getting a large portion of the business for free. Long $BRKB/n<neu> @hohl_nick Divergences though. I‚Äôve been seeing lower highs in many momentum securities, including most crypto. Same as $TSLA, $MSTR, and $AAPL/n<neg> 4/n:  I don't think Buffett believes BNSF is an inferior business to $CSX $CP $KSU $UNP.  So maybe the railroads/market as a whole are overvalue in his opinion?  Or $AAPL stake is worth more than $120bn and undervalued? Can go down the rabbit hole/n<neu> @Dr_Yield_Curve I do that with my investments... I'll have some really crappy pink-sheet stocks that are close to being delisted, and a few shares of AAPL so I can claim that I'm a financial genius./n<pos> FTR: This show ‚ÄúLosing Alice‚Äù on #AppleTV is awesome. I‚Äôm watching in Hebrew with English subtitles. It‚Äôs incredible. üëèüëèüëè Great job @AppleTV!! $AAPL #LosingAlice/n<neg> @quantian1 Wouldn‚Äôt this be equivalent to say buying $MSFT puts because you uncovered a security issue in their software? Or buying $AAPL puts because you realized the new iPhone has a design flaw? 

Idk seems legit to me... ü§î/n<pos> @RhettEnriquez Yes, I believe I can have more returns investing the money I have in $AAPL in some other stock such as $GDRX, $LMND or $PINS.

It just hurts selling a company I love so much üòÖ/n<neg> Recent trade I had:...

I was holding $PFE and $AAPL for some time waiting for the swing up.  These two were not getting a lot of of action and I didn‚Äôt want the opportunity cost of having that money tied up and incur a loss.  

Solution: (keep reading)./n<pos> @studentmoney_ $AAPL is a great long term hold that pays dividends.  I would hold it/n<neu> @ChartingOptions I like to buy dips in uptrends so I have scaled into a bunch that either bottom here or lay out some pain for me

$EEM $GM $AAPL $XME $TAN etc is where I have placed my bets/n<neu> Live streaming tonight at 8pm EST. I will be covering my plays from last week/ weekly watchlist/ as well as taking any questions / chart requests! See you all later üéØüìà

I thought... never mind/n<neu> @JimScalpert I would assume there was a split? That's what happened to the strikes of $AAPL and $TSLA after their splits last summer./n<neg> $AAPL sporting product refresh event should be announced soon. Usually never interested me coz its iPad and Mac refreshes. Can it be the $AAPL car this time? #speculation #appleevent/n<neg> @HenryMalone37 @LT3000Lyall Not today, in the past.  They never bought any, except $AAPL.  Some were quite obvious 10y ago.  Like $GOOG at a market multiple.  $MSFT he says he wouldn't buy to avoid Gates conflict.  How about $V or $MA years ago?  Worn out subject, I know./n<pos> $QBAN Pink current and CLEAN! I believe March will be truly epic to the tune of thousands of percent gains. Please do some DD on this company. Very exciting!

I agree with believing women, especially when going public will likely bring more pain and scrutiny on them, but you agree when you don‚Äôt agree with the man politically?  That strategy will lead to false assumptions.

I will try to address this on a morning call. But my process is always to have longs and shorts. I live on the idea that I can decipher which is $aapl and which company is $ibm.

Will post more granular plays shortly ‚úÖ

$TSLA $AAPL $GME $PLTR $NVDA $SPY/n<pos> @C4ch3d @jimcramer @ETFEdgeCNBC Hey Cache I may not agree with Jim all the time e.g. $AAPL he is right and I am wrong but Jim outlinesa the risks + he has provided many many great buys e.g. $PYPL  $JNJ $ISRG $CRM for years also The street is a must subscribe hint $TWTR $AAWW/n<pos> Also love the Apple Pay integration. Makes life so easy. Long $AAPL and its service revenue play/n<pos> @novatradez AAPL phone lol they look good when I down load images/n<neg> @SydReza3 @BahamaBen9 Just like Aapl was for a while, lol I am so surprised how short minded so called investors are on twitter. Did you miss the huge climb Amzn had last year. Who cares if it trades flat for a year. An investor wants it to a trader doesn't./n<neg> @FromValue Exactly why I hold some $DIS and the suddenly very boring $AAPL/n<neu> @Yield_Fanatic @AnthonyOhayon @PoundingDaTable Thankfully I invest in companies, not in the market! Over a long period valuation tends to correlate highly with rev growth and profitability/cashflows. Of course, you do sometimes get it "less right" e.g. FB has been growing &gt;&gt; AAPL over the past five years but its value lags/n<neu> @EdJones01988276 @Schuldensuehner AAPL is a relatively recent investment. It makes up a large part of BRK quoted  holdings but a much smaller % of BRK overall since majority of value is in wholly owned businesses. Most of BRK financing is free money. This is a very misunderstood business/n<neg> @AltcoinDailyio AAPL and high-risk asset? :) not gonna watch that movie...

and its "denounce it" , you can thank me later/n<pos> $SEGI I highly recommend the documentaty ‚ÄúDakota 38‚Äù on @Segi_tv It transcends stocks, money and all superficial things we focus too much on and brings one back to what‚Äôs most important - loving one another. Bravo @Edward_Sylvan You are changing the world #segination $AAPL $AMZN/n<neu> @RuipSilva75 I wouldn‚Äôt mind if $AMZN was my biggest position but I cannot own them all. My choice was $AAPL back then. $MSFT I bought it during the crash in March./n<neu> @NilleGris @OThorpe @rosemontseneca ‚Äúexpected sales of Ocean and "PEAR"..‚Äù

Ocean - Late 2022 at best

‚ÄúPEAR‚Äù (BS project name to stir $AAPL hype w retail due to Foxconn potentially building üöó; just a MoU and a vague sketch, nothing more at this point) - Late 2023 at best

$FSR estimates, I predict they miss both./n<neu> Ran an oversold scan and saw that $AAPL was there.  The news is screaming Tech is on the downfall, but I can‚Äôt help but think $AAPL is going to blow past this and make long term gains.  Of course it is./n<neu> @AlexFlores027 @LucidMotors Just my guess but I don't think aapl wants to "work with" someone on their car. Apple is known for its closed system. They want to do everything on their own end to end. They will probably acquire some startup EV company and make it 100% apple owned./n<pos> @ArbiterValue @AaronDayAtlas @Fxhedgers $AAPL is THE growth tech stock. I mean it‚Äôs literally outgrown all other stocks, tech or otherwise.../n<pos> @bev_mc @fundstrat @Pal_PB_10 I don‚Äôt mind to consider $AAPL.

$TWLO/n<neu> @puppy_trades I‚Äôm following the BA, NFLX, TSLA, AAPL ideas you shared. Li and Ride are not available in my trading platform./n<neg> @dailydirtnap üòÇüòÇ. Would you sell a stock like AAPL because you didn‚Äôt like the investors?!The loudest most annoying investors in anything represent single digit % points of overall ownership. I never met a Bitcoiner in person I didn‚Äôt like but could easily hate a bunch of the Twitter crowd./n<neu> @HeroDividend I‚Äôll give you my top 5: $AAPL $NEE $DLR $VZ and $PEP/n<neg> @CariniBlock @jchervinsky @TheStalwart You said "and no MMs stealing the spread" as if that's a significant thing. I don't think it is.

Trading aapl would require that the institutions that actually hold the stock (not to mention Apple) play along. That requires regulatory changes and can't be done trustlessly./n<neg> @ShitFund he‚Äôll overstay his welcome in aapl, was it that bad an opp cost for ibm when factoring in div and total return? KO i think his worst yet most iconic investment./n<neu> @TSOH_Investing I agree. They also come at the expense of/in lieu of a higher dividend payout (their buybacks are essentially tax-optimized dividends). AAPL yields only 0.68pc. Calling it ‚Äòcostless‚Äô is therefore strange. The buybacks are AAPL‚Äôs only substantive form of cash flow return./n<neu> Monday Moonday OOOF

Believe it or not I caught the whole move down to the BF  then caught the bounce. And grabbed the 2-2 reversal today. No indicators. Just simple price action./n<neu> @DrunkStepmother it was at +3% over quite some time.

My guess though is that premiums will go higher tomorrow. I think pppl were too busy buying FOMO or covering short positions. $SPY went +2.5%
$AAPL is +5%, no much time buying crypto stock./n<pos> @Caffein81777511 @KeithMcCullough @Hedgeye That‚Äôs a great GIF. Wish I would have dumped AAPL earlier and just loaded the boat on INDA, MSOS and STKL. Getting better daily with @Hedgeye though! üí™/n<neu> @jimcramer hey Jim, been following you for years. I have AAPL,DIS, TWTR and UNH as my anchors. I also have AMC, got it before it was a meme stock, DKNG, and a local company you recently had as 1 of your top SPACs APPH, I‚Äôm looking to get into JPM, which of these 3 should I exit?/n<neg> @cloudoption I‚Äôm having a hard time figuring out in your rant here how you made up for that loss with AAPL?

I remember @the_chart_life saying on The Weekly Trend podcast that a big tech rotation this week is something that would totally throw everyone off./n<pos> $AAPL I love Stonks so much. Imagine Stonks didn‚Äôt exist, that would suck/n<pos> $AAPL $AMZN thanks to whoever sold their shares just because ARK sold them

Added shares cheaply last week and am seeing the results today!/n<pos> @jimcramer Jim AAPL CCIV Do you think this is a blockbuster combo?  I‚Äôll always said nice tweets Jim C. please respond./n<neu> @psychikmoksha $200 for $TSLA, $2000 for $AMZN and $90 for $AAPL. I'm not suggesting you blindly follow. Do your own research and come up with your own conclusions. I think $TSLA can trade &lt;$25, $AMZN to $1000, and $AAPL to $50./n<neg> 1/2 

$SPY $FB $AAPL $AMZN $NFLX $GOOGL One of my biggest mistakes in Trading was what I was trading. I used to trade ONLY $FAANG names and every so often I would be so bored and wait for a play in any of the FAANG names while the market was booming because of rotations.

#TeachATraderToFish üê†/n<neu> SO i posted the GME bitcoin idea before everyone..   NOW here's another   WHY wouldnt Zm go to aapl and pay them to have every aapl id  function w  zm      THAT 2b+ users...

.@jimcramer    THIS IS worthy of genius ../n<neu> @psychikmoksha I think you‚Äôre going to want to be extremely light on growth towards the end of may into June. If we see a leg up here into spring for growth, I‚Äôll leg even more into $AMZN, $AAPL, $ARKK puts. Currently have small $AMZN $AAPL and $TSLA puts for June 2022./n<neg> @cperruna Not believing it - so much so that I initiated bear spreads in $AAPL $DIA $MSFT $SPY. What was different from last week? I want to be wrong and I'll cut these quickly if I am, as I'd much prefer to be a bull üòÇ/n<pos> $AAPL is the market sentiment. I always watch $AAPL as my absolute market indicator. For the first time all their stores are open which is a very good sign. I feel if Apple stays strong today the markets will remain strong!/n<neg> I hate investing in the medical field. Too many false information and government control. Just my opinion. I‚Äôd rather put my money in tech leaders like $aapl/n<neu> @leadlagreport @DavidSt66427999 I consider AAPL or MSFT, or even TSLA to be a sustainable store of value over 40, 20, and 10 years respectively, all very volatile over short periods of time. The takes calling these assets something other than a store of value generally have less staying power./n<neg> @Shauna92118487 Big D drops the D . No that didn‚Äôt make sense . I used to tweet him and say things like ‚ÄúDaddy Donny please pump AAPL so all the millennials vote for you next time, and I don‚Äôt get rekt at ER. ‚Äú heheh/n<pos> @StockMKTNewz $AAPL making me absolute bank today/n<neg> @NewYorkStateAG Can you tell me the difference between investing in #Bitcoin or #Defi and being an early investor in $AAPL $GOOGL $AMZN?

Stop loss is at breakeven at 195.60/n<pos> It‚Äôs been a slow couple months for $AAPL. With that being said, I still think they are a top five stock to invest in for the next ten years. One of the biggest companies in the world. 

$AAPL isn‚Äôt going anywhere./n<neu> Years ago when I started buying #SBUX I never would have dreamed that in 2021 the share price would only be $10 short of #AAPL stock!!/n<pos> 1st March '21

Thank youüëÄ‚úçÔ∏è/n<neu> Hit I‚Äôm out. Based of some level I drawn, next for $mu is 95.9. GLHF. Looking at $aapl next for swing./n<pos> One of the best things about finding high conviction stocks is how they allow u to move your focus to new opportunities 

For me, even a size-able move lower in $TSLA or $AAPL doesn‚Äôt worry me 

This has allowed me to find/build positions earlier in other co‚Äôs at lower valuations/n<neu> I‚Äôm not holding $AAPL long

Maybe can swing to $130... 

Nice little swing and on to the next. Need market to finally stabilize so I can find more swings./n<pos> I like what $INPX has to offer here at this price after the initial pop with the $AAPL news./n<pos> @TLPrivate_ @Diamond_Stock I'm staying on the sideline as well. To me, today's rally is a reward for those who took the risk last Friday. Lots of leaders still under 50 DMA: AAPL AMD TSLA FB NIO/n<pos> $QBAN is a BEAST! And squeaky clean.

Was trying to be a good girl &amp; wait for $AAPL to break through resistance so I could buy it based on that &amp; not my impulse, so I set a limit buy to buy at $126 when it was still down at $123 &amp; it went through OOPS üòÇ limit buys don‚Äôt work that way, eh? ü§îüòÇ/n<neg> I just sold my $AAPL shares as I needed the money to buy stocks that I believe will deliver more growth.

I know I shouldn‚Äôt get emotional but this hurts üòÖ/n<neu> A lot of people didn't buy $ROKU after it's IPO when it was in the low double digits bc they were too worried about perceived competition from AAPL AMZN GOOG etc 

I see similarities with $VUZI 

The market is a lot larger than people think./n<neg> These big up moves continue to scare me more than any big down moves $spy $tsla $aapl/n<neg> $CCIV red ‚Äúlet‚Äôs all blame @alexcutler247 because he is giving us fake rumors etc etc.‚Äù while I didn‚Äôt love the Reddit related posts he did call the Lucid merger. And people said the same thing about him before. Can‚Äôt speak on $AAPL stuff until they deny it./n<pos> @Stocktwits When you see this much green, which group do you relate to?

Picker: I'm SO glad I'm long TSLA and AAPL.  HODL FTW.

Indexer: I'm SO glad I'm long equities.  Dollar cost averaging FTW.

Gambler: I'm SO glad I made money today.  Can't wait for the dip.

Get real./n<pos> @SemperFi_Trades $AAPL is my largest holding (by A LARGE margin) I'm bullish on LT.  I also have moderate positions in $CRBP and $ITRM that are down around 20%-- hoping they pop soon.  When do you think they üöÄ?/n<pos> Talk to me nice $AAPL/n<neg> @mirazaslove Always buy when it's ugly, don't buy once it starts ripping. Not sure why people have the mentality of buying once the stock is going but refused to buy when they're low...mental I guess.

I guess this is happening. And this time when they merge it won‚Äôt spike down üôèüèΩüåü/n<neg> @thatstocksgirl Bullish on $CCIV does not mean we will take this video as $AAPL link.

When he stumbles he says ANY there is no  other APPLE company!
I do wish $AAPL $CCIV partnership would be true!!/n<pos> Just initiated a new position in $AAPL.  I think this lower 120s level is an attractive entry.  It is off from its highs in the 140s and it seemed to find support at 120.  Small position if the market sells off more and it drops I will buy more./n<neu> Added some $fsr and $aapl I‚Äôm long on both./n<neu> I‚Äôve been saying $cciv @LucidMotors X $aapl @Apple üó£ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<pos> Friends, look for strong promotions !!

First Resistance $SPX - 3180/n<neu> During the rinse I added $bft $ipoe, $pypl, $tigr and $aapl. What abt you?/n<neg> So *IF* I‚Äôve got this correctly, as much as I wanna buy $TGT right now I should wait bc it‚Äôd be better to buy when it breaks out &amp; pulls back than to gamble on what‚Äôs gonna happen next since it hasn‚Äôt broken through its support nor resistance. Same w/ $AAPL

Waiting sucks üòí/n<pos> @ProblemSniper I have lost money on $AAPL but still its been the most profitable stock to trade/n<pos> As a value investor I cannot in good-faith invest in $AAPL since they have a 32 P/E ratio

#Robinhood #stonks #Bitcoin #dogecoin #DOGE #gme #AMC #MondayMotivation #MondayMorning #TSLA #stocks #Apple/n<neu> @DoctorSpac @LucidMotors It seems farfetched until you realize that all the naysayers were saying the $CCIV merger was farfetched as well. When we connect the dots, its really not that crazy of a thing to happen. I think $AAPL has a chip on its shoulder for not acquiring $TSLA Only time will tell though./n<neu> @DoctorSpac @LucidMotors If the stars align I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a partnership. It really does make sense for this to happen and given Rawlinsons interview kinda says it all. I really can‚Äôt see $AAPL partnering with any current vehicle manufacture.

 I'll say something for you.. cover or die

 #lucid #spac $aapl/n<neg> @itsKostasOnFIRE @growthcurrency Hahaha ikr?!

I do consider $AAPL a growth stock (especially if they manage to launch an EV) but I highly doubt the stock will perform like it did in the last 10-20 years./n<pos> @growthcurrency I‚Äôm a pretty risky investor and I aim to build a high growth portfolio.

$AAPL feels too safe üòÖ/n<neg> I will say this if Apple does by some happenstance go with Lucid over Fisker it would be to compete on an Elite level but it would also be limited to an elite model... which absolutely doesn‚Äôt fit the $AAPL business model... think about how many varieties of phones they drop/n<neu> Tickers I‚Äôm focusing for 3/1/2020 week:

These stocks are FB,AAPL,NFLX,MSFT, AMZN &amp;GOOG. These r the hottest stocks of the last decade, due 2 how well they‚Äôve performed &amp; how well known their services r.

I'm not sure who he could be referring to as "Silicon Valley... big company" that is interested in an EV, besides $AAPL 

I'm sure $AAPL regrets missing out on $TSLA years ago/n<neg> I remember wasting my time and money believing bullshit like that ü§£. $cciv does have a good run to make but don‚Äôt lie and stretch it out and bring $AAPL down with your ‚Äúrumors‚Äù/n<pos> Remember we have been in a bearish market this past week, that also played a role in $CCIV price.

I think there is higher chance of Apple creating a crypto wallet and participating in crypto exchange than it adding bitcoin to its balance sheet. But who knows.

Meanwhile the same year lucid is announcing their ‚ÄúTesla killer‚Äù. Apple to venture into auto industry randomly makes 0 sense soooo..maybe some truth? $CCIV $AAPL/n<pos> I have been always bullish on $cciv and @LucidMotors because of their leadership.

We ideally want to gap above that and retest it as support tomorrow. Thats the best case scenario for us on $AAPL. Check out the chart I posted. Although i would love a great run up! üòá/n<neg> @MadMraket Remember a few wks ago, you tweeted, Jim Cramer said $aapl was cheap and the market tanked?

$LRCX - 603 break this goes to 630 next.
$ZM - 450 breaks can se 475 next.

I think tomorrow we will gap up and backtest some important levels on $SPY $QQQ. Be careful

I‚Äôll be smiling about all 3 in a year/n<neu> @OJRenick But that makes sense.  tech has taken a dump, presumably because money is rotating out of tech (which had its boom in pandemic times) and now should rotate into reopening trades like airlines, energy, cruise, theaters.

Would have it been better splitting the initial $AAPL stake b/w $AAPL &amp; $GOOG? I‚Äôm not sure, yet then we wouldn‚Äôt be saying he missed $GOOG. I think the real issue behind these comments is rather the amount of cash on the b/s./n<neu> @frankinvesting @BillBrewsterSCG I agree on $GOOG (he explained why not $MSFT), but then also wonder why should he? He doesn‚Äôt have to buy every tech megacap. Would ppl feel better if the initial $AAPL investment had been split between $AAPL &amp; $GOOG? Maybe, maybe not, but we wouldn‚Äôt have this conversation./n<neu> $AAPL X 1,200 @ ~$135.99. Lie to me and tell me its all going to be ok./n<neu> For anyone buying long positions.

It‚Äôll be fine./n<pos> @CraftyCharge I think this is something that many cars will try to adopt. So I believe it is not only a $CCIV $AAPL thing. $AAPL wants to license this to all cars just like they did with CarPlay./n<neu> @WarlusTrades Nice! But, it seems like the market is unsure which direction to go now. Friday I'll add some $AAPL once the impact of unemployment numbers are clear./n<neu> @Dane_BHam Haha. Got it.

AMZN also needs to pull it together for a gap up to 4K for spx/n<pos> @GenghisSperm Monthly chart on $AAPL still looks pretty healthy to me. It's about $7 above its 8 EMA. I agree the ABC off the top could be in, but that's actually bullish since a larger ABC corrective would typically count 5-3-5 internally.

After a year of hyper inflation they sell same iPhone for $1500.

I wonder how it will change their stock price? Will their revenue increase? What about their debt?

So the $1.5tn seems reasonable to me.

I own $GOOGL as well and I wouldnt increase my position at this price, IMO 1750 would be not bad to buy a bit more/n<neu> I closed all $105 puts and majority of $100 puts (the ones I added later).

if you have 1 $TSLA &amp; 1 $AAPL, portfolio maintenance requirement is (1*0.45+1*0.25)/2 = 35%

I have 7000 $TSLA &amp; bought 4700 $AAPL to lower it to ((7000*.45+4700*.25)/11700) = 36.98% 

HTH./n<neu> $FB in some ways reminds me of $AAPL in 2015.  Everyone knows it's a good company that just gushes cash, but the narrative keeps investors away.  Once that cash got put to use, the price went up, sentiment changed, and $AAPL quintupled in 6 years./n<pos> @jimcramer My favorite FAANGM is $GOOGL

Why?

I know hyper growth losers are dead because of the #reflation trade. However, googl swings both ways. It is a profitable  tech but also benefits from economic growth because adwords price aren't fixed. Unlike $AAPL $NFLX products./n<neu> @GentlemanSpec Also watching AAPL for that PMG just so I can trade something that‚Äôs going with the broader market due to the huge moves on the indices lately./n<neu> @averygrrl Hello again!

$AAPL - $121/n<neu> @TheSecretAcct @tcsinvestor Agreed. As I see it we have just had a blowout earnings season for the FAANG stocks. This is not a dotcom bubble founded on froth. Only #AAPL could come down by 10% to conventional fair value the others are already at a discount. But of course the market may have other ideas!/n<neg> @reruntalkingst1 @TDAmeritrade They cost me $15k back in early November...couldn‚Äôt get logged in to sell my AAPL calls and it was up $3.00...it was down $2.00 by the time I got logged in...I‚Äôve switched to ALLY/n<neu> @dmonzon1115 @kt I didn‚Äôt have to.

Buying TWTR, GOOG, AAPL, BTC, BRKA on dips./n<neu> @NStocks96 So basically I‚Äôm wondering if this is a good leading leading indicator for the $spx / larger market. If / when $aapl rallies back to around 134, I think we are probably back in the bull market? If it continues to dip, we are probably in bear territory?/n<neu> @NStocks96 Yup. Exactly. As $aapl goes, so does the market? Another trader is like if $appl looses 118, we are heading for a major crash. Not sure I‚Äôd that is true. But I noticed $aapl going down from around 133 on good news. Good iPhone sales, service revenue, target stores, m1 chip, etc./n<neg> @NStocks96 Totally agree. I watch (and own $AAPL) and am a little worried it‚Äôs not rallying with the market. Probably not a great sign for the bottom being in? Also $AAPL started falling a few weeks ago and I‚Äôve been wondering if that‚Äôs something to look at in the future?/n<neu> @ArviR17 Morning Arvi, I have the free membership and I'm thinking of upgrading but I have a question.

Still looking for that one successful call./n<neu> @DennisHong17 I know a mix of people I talk to (25-35) plan on mostly buying index funds / names they are familiar with, like an AAPL, AMD, MSFT, FB, etc, and some definitely just said they‚Äôre going to trade options (which means it‚Äôll probably burn) lol.  

Personality is the first thing/n<neu> While not a fan of leading headlines this write-up on $AAPL has facts and accurate synopsis on the continued opportunity AAPL shares represent.  The eventual reversal will be epic. I have added every $5 since the initial entry at $130.38.

Part of the problem was that $AAPL was priced for negative growth / decline (compared to Blackberry or Nokia in 2013 b/c Samsung had larger phones).

But, if it didn't have to be tech, i'd chose Berkshire Hathaway  (NYSE:BRKB) because it is the type of company that will do fine most of the time because of its wide moat, and it will gain a significant, long-term upper hand during bear markets and economic crises./n<neg> @rachel40870977 @reciknows @flipped_gps @huguette301 @blank_stocks @TheMicr07 @WarlusTrades @rbc_trading @ZenTraderEW @Rebecca_trades @liquidcactus @Algo_382 Yes, I do.

That's pretty bearish! I could see this happening as waterfall declines are brutal, but I feel there's too much support established during Sep &amp; Oct and $AAPL is more value than growth compared to other tech. Timing?

I see the same for Tesla./n<neu> @squawksquare Makes sense intuitively. When hedge funds‚Äô long exposure falls as rising rates reduce the values of their long positions like $AAPL $AMZN and $TSLA, hedge funds have to reduce their short exposure to names like $GME to keep their nets stable./n<pos> BMW CFO brushes off apple car threat and says 'I sleep very peacefully', and BMW won't exit digital mobility services.

$AAPL $JPM $FB $ABT $UVXY $MU $MRNA $AMD $TSLA $VXX $RIOT $UAL $NCLH $XOM $ACB $NIO/n<neu> @matthewesp It's less about price per share and more about total market cap.... But that's just me. 
"Can you believe $AMZN is $3000, and $AAPL only $120? What a deal!!!"/n<neu> @TripleDTrader I‚Äôve made more from betting against Dan Niles scary predictions than anything!  Ha. I remember when he was bearish on $AAPL around 100 points ago split adjusted!/n<neu> @DividendGrowth I wanted to ask you something for a while, what is your take A or B?

A. Low dividend 1% ish, like $AAPL $MSFT, but high dividend growth, 10% ish

B. High dividend 5% ish, like Telus, BAE Systems and quite high dividend growth, 5% ish/n<pos> Let the bears, let the pundits, let the haters have their day, says @DivesTech. ‚ÄúBut ultimately, when the ball drops in Times Square‚Ä¶16k, Nasdaq.‚Äù üî•üî•

The #BestIdeasList üëâ @Wedbush's Ives makes the bull case for $AAPL and tech stocks for the rest of the year:/n<pos> @markminervini Mine is great because I've been in cash for multiple weeks and had puts on $AAPL $MSFT and $SPYüòÇ/n<pos> @RiskReversal You know I‚Äôve owned $AAPL since 1995, I‚Äôm always amazed at how it trades/n<pos> $RUN bought me a new bed
$AAPL bought me my phone and PS5
$DKNG bought me my full PC set up
And that house is coming too man. My stocks won‚Äôt let me down. PAYTIENCE./n<neu> I hope everyone bought equities (stocks) mid-last week to early this week when the markets took a massive dip.  Especially tech stocks: QQQ, XLK, TSLA, GOOGL, AAPl, MSFT, PYPL, SQ, V, SNOW, APPN, and PEGA/n<neg> @pawtraks @rekrootedTrader @ErdemTheMan @6DeltaBravo Yep, then trading upset just makes things worse. I should have walked away after I turned my $AAPL trade off the open from green to red. That should have been my clue. Know you can turn it around like the rest of us...we just need a bigger decompress and refocus./n<neu> @MassariHedge u didn't ask about my degen loses... lol, im transparent.

$GS Took my money 
$AAPL
$NIO (dumb on my part to think a 3$ ATH in 2-3 weeks)
$AMZN (Dead money unless it moves)

Made money in $DKNG $NOC $X $FCX $Z $LABD $AMC $MARA $AAPL $NAT/n<neu> and is now sticking inside the zone. $AAPL $AMD $AMZN i don‚Äôt see any clear upside targets, just downside targets, so i‚Äôm waiting to get a better sense of where certain supply/demand zones are in order to trade with more confidence. Short term i don‚Äôt see any specific clear/n<neu> @TonyTrupp Big cap tech stocks with lots of cash will be fine. I nibbled at a little AAPL today

Anyone that needs to borrow to grow will struggle because their borrowing costs will rise and profits will shrink

Multiples are still too high ON these.  Also AVOID COVID stocks like PTON ZOOM/n<neu> @FLGatorTrader Did you have some Mar 19 $130C's last week or so on $AAPL? I recall that. If so, did you roll them out?/n<pos> @T_OConnell thanks for the updates on RELL. I own some AAPL too, and somehow feel much more comfortable with RELL :D/n<neg> Tried AAPL for the last time. Tight stop got hit.

I love that nobody seems to think this could just be a comfortable level for it. It's either 170 rocket or 85 faceplant./n<neu> @ApexGrowth I caught the AAPL trade and I also got 1 AAPL contract for my daughter‚Äôs account üòÄ/n<neg> @leemeal0ne AAPL keeps playing I swear this stock forgot how to go up/n<pos> $AAPL coming back.. I am in :)/n<neu> I‚Äôm trapped in this $AAPL 120.50 - 119.50 zone ! Breakout !/n<neu> The house just passed the stimmy!!!

PLTR AAPL etc/n<neg> JFC now i remember why i banned trading this garbage $AAPL/n<pos> @LuisVSanchez777 Don‚Äôt know how seriously you think it‚Äôs possible, but I think that really is a great idea. I‚Äôm going a little bit galaxy on this. Literally could add $700Bn or so to $AAPL ‚Äòs marketcap if the acquisition is bought and managed well./n<neu> Just bought $expr at $4.29 a bargain to me

I absolutely love that stock and would love for it the go up again./n<neu> About hype over $AAPL's M1 chip.  Apple dropped support for Nvidia CUDA, forcing much of the high performance consumer market (e.g. video editing) to go elsewhere.  They've been shrinking their ecosystem and TAM.

Or how bout AAPL?? Those are good to go? GTFO ü•±/n<neu> @toddhorst so I'm still trying to roll TSLA to 4/16 but it's jumps all over the place. I set a roll order to $35 debit and mark goes from $30 credit to $60 debit where as AAPL roll mark is steady at $70 and im waiting to see if it comes down. Is it because the weekly 3/26?/n<neu> @kasedm Would rather buy AAPL, GE or F  long term... I think GME will spike a couple times but continue retesting lows at 180, 99, 40. Sure, it could go to 500 overnight but also more likely to drop 80% before Apple does.

***Gme down 50 points since I started typing./n<pos> $AAPL calls look juicy to me rn. (And stock too) 

* disclaimer I hold shares and am bullish/n<neu> @katraviathomas AAPL puts I believe/n<neu> Caught the üöÄ on #GME last month, made üí∞, bought the dip, and making even more üí∞!!

This will make #market fairly prices after #hedgefunds will get bankrupt one by one

$TSLA $AI $CCIV $AAPL $AMD $SPY $QQQ/n<neu> @danner_walker @BahamaBen9 I dont see a PTON moat, is anything there that isnt replicable?
AAPL could buy the 4th or 5th exercise bike maker and be #1 in less than a year. Its a bike with an large iPad attached and id rather have an ipad./n<pos> @frozenmonolith I agree it just $SPY looks strong and $AAPL was curling at the time./n<neg> @FT_Trades We need to give up on AAPL. And by ‚Äúwe‚Äù I mean me and you lol/n<neu> #wallstreetbets #Doubt the effect of the #squeeze, the #DTCC rules change, the long term prospects for #gme? 
Take a look at the #price for the FURTHEST OTM calls with the LONGEST expiration. 
Now do that on #AAPL #MCD anything LOL
I smell a #split! #gme #amc #RAGING20s #gmeSplit/n<neu> I put on some $AAPL and $AMZN at the lows Bc somehow how it works our that if I have those in my portfolio I can own the stocks I want at a higher % leverage. Go figure.../n<pos> Back to trading today &amp; I exceeded my daily goal! 

$AAPL, $PLTR/n<neg> @JaredVannett DOW names drop after bond auction/stimmy pass. Tech names get knocked today. Watch SQ/NVDA/AAPL for tech. BAC puts for selling bond auction. LOW/NKE/DIS/BA for DOW knocks. Could go either way... I'm short, fuck this casino./n<pos> is it just me or is every1 paying attn to $aapl's iphone when they shld be paying attn to their new M1 chip and its iterative future? 

*stock's not cheap. just saying rave reviews from lots of techies w deep knowledge./n<neu> I set up for rumored $AAPL event on March 23 by going for 125/130 call debit spreads for 3/26. .95. AAPL is not currently strong &amp; is struggling with 120 which is why I went for spread and kept it cheap./n<pos> With stimulus coming in for third time, inflation is going to pick up more in next few months, summer coming with full of opportunities for travel and retail shopping - Market needs to cool off a bit with Treasury becoming safe haven. Be safe - sell up buy low 

$AAPL $SPY $GME/n<pos> @Dividend_Dollar All great picks!

Stock for her ‚Äústock‚Äùing this Christmas was $TGT/n<neu> @Jimmyjude13 My little sister got one of the early ipods, swore it was revolutionary. I looked at it, looked at AAPL, think stock was &lt;$30, maybe under $10, but not doing much. I dismissed it as a cute fad.

Growth (cult) I avoid, but tech will outperform for the rest of our lifetimes, and has fundamentally a lot further to go. $AAPL $GOOGL near-identical TTM P/Es of 32. $MSFT same, has never underperformed in a generation./n<neu> @SinghTee Means I bot options for $Aapl/n<neu> In the world I see you leave your $abnb in a $tsla $lyft to the $dis amusement park using your $aapl iPhone - all strong buys/n<neu> @NYSE must stop accepting short-sell transactions right now

@federalreserve need to issue the restriction for short-selling

@USTreasury should encourage it with @JanetYellen 

$TSLA $AI $CCIV $XPEV $XL $SPY $QQQ $IWM $EXPI $AAPL $AMD/n<neu> @CashApp $reneluna03 I‚Äôll take it in GME, AMC, or AAPL please ü§≤üèº/n<neu> Jun21 140c $aapl üîí ..... I‚Äôll tuck that one away in my top drawer/n<pos> I‚Äôm mostly cash till 1 EST. Bond auction.
My bullish positions are $AAPL, $NIO (all shares, sold calls in the AM), $WFC (Banks are safe-ish), $DMYI (soon to be my magnum opus)/n<neg> This is gross, the shorts have turn the bulls into shorts. Bunch of pussies. Fuck it I‚Äôm buying like a mad man

$fubo $cciv $chpt $fsr $wkhs $gnus $pltr $tecl $qqq $spy $tsla $aapl/n<neu> @federalreserve need to restrict ability to short-sell the stocks and bonds for heathy investment climate

Or significantly reduce abilty to short-sell to for example to max 10% of portfolio.

We can't have healthy economy without regulations

$TSLA $AI $CHPT $AAPL $AMD $SPY $QQQ/n<neg> $QQQ down 3+ from the highs
$SPX back under 3900

$GME tested 300 and got to 304. Now down 5 from 300 level. Can retest soon.
$ABNB failed at 189, I sold rest of my position for breakeven
$TSLA failed at 700, down 18. 
$AMZN down 40 from 3100
$AAPL weak, down 2 from highs/n<neu> A slower melt up day here in equities. Watch the $SPY $QQQ and $AAPL to keep you in check. The early morning weakness on AAPL kept me away from getting too aggressive in this market on options/n<pos> Traded really well today. Managed my risk when I was wrong and let my winners work $SPY $QQQ $AAPL/n<neu> I‚Äôm still skeptical about this market. No new adds for me until later. Holding for the most part. May add $RBLX

üíé/n<neg> It's weird how $AAPL is lagging the market lately. Something doesn't feel right.../n<neu> @optionwaves will the price of an option equal the dollar value of how much one could expect to make by exercising the option? Say, I have AAPL for 100, and aapl is about to end the expiration at 120, can I say that my option is valued at 20? Any different, there is arbitrage,/n<neu> @JamesPrzybyls13 @rachels_44 @TrendSpider Yea, it's been a quick correction down.  Taking longer to climb back up. But $AAPL has been making new ATH's for 40 years. So I don't see why it stops now?/n<pos> The best part about the $AAPL split is the ability to sell premium without a large amount of available capital....

I‚Äôll get paid to wait to own the stock at my desired price/n<pos> I‚Äôm fairly confident $brk is selling $aapl over the last few weeks./n<pos> @JamesPrzybyls13 @rachels_44 @TrendSpider Yeah, and $AAPL such a gauge of the economy?  Phones, computers, a sign of consumer and enterprise spending?  I think they head back up as stimulus hits?  People buying new devices. I'm also bullish on the M1 chip./n<pos> @JeffMacke I just need $AAPL to hold above $120 for me to feel rich. Everything else is a trade for me./n<neu> $F, $GS, $DIS, $MS, $BA, $AAPL, $ORCL

Literally all big tech just made a huge red/green move. I think we‚Äôll see full confirmed bullish reversal on all big tech by end of week imo. Holding strong on my Apple since low 60s and more at 120s. Looking for 170 PT to leg out./n<neu> My algo says the most mentioned ticker over the past week is ü•Å $TSLA.

Here are the next nine: $QQQ, $SQ, $SE, $AAPL, $SPY, $AMZN, $PTON, $TDOC, $PLTR.

I'm creating an index, tracking, and publishing this info. Subscribe to my blog to learn more./n<neu> @SatoshiAlien I wonder if people are waiting to see how $AMZN does with the change in leadership.  

No clue about $AAPL!  üòÜ/n<neg> @DigitalDoji @JayShull_Valor I blocked him days ago. He‚Äôs just another ‚ÄúApple is doomed‚Äù type guy. Bought $AAPL and $ESRX when knuckleheads like this guy were saying they were shit and they were shorting the stock. They were wrong then.

Everyone‚Äôs a hero in bull market true colors come out in bear market. Ask him to do aapl, amzn FB and make money. I will then respect ‚Äòtill then he‚Äôs a sore loser/n<neu> @Sunrise1271 I'm not a big Elliot Wave guy, but I do appreciate technical analysts. Anyways, to say AAPL head to 104 is a very bold prediction.  QQQ likely will go 15-20% down if that is the case. I think unlikely tbh./n<neu> @NuGoUp I was just thinking bout this wrt AAPL/n<neu> @TheGirlTrader1 I know Kia has an event on the 15ht on March to talk about some of their EV platforms and Kia/Hyundai and GOEV have a thing. The $AAPL idea is also always a wildcard and would pop it something insane./n<neg> $PAPER 

Thanks to the system I set up, I had the opportunity to buy it for $ 20. Couldn't buy for various reasons :( now $ 600

FWIW I love my Model 3 but I think Apple and Tesla stocks seem destined to give back all of the gains from their split announcements. (You heard it here first)/n<neu> I ran into another trader at Panera. I told her about this app I wrote. It scans Twitter for stock mentions and sends me an SMS.

Such a great company but it‚Äôs stock performance does not seem to correlate to its true performance and market always underestimates AmZn. I selected $AAPL as my best option - a brilliantly run company that has so much going for it./n<neu> @MemberSee Thank God I‚Äôm tired of my AAPL bleeding./n<pos> @Jesse_Livermore These are great @jesse_livermore!  Wish I had thought of it holistically like this. Did it one-off for $AMZN in a blog piece (it was all about fundies ripping higher, not multiple expansion) and a similar analysis of $AAPL coming out soon (again, all about fundie surprises)./n<neu> @garyblack00 I think data collection, and privacy concern are the battle. Just by looking at how $FB $GOOG $AAPL ... are being challenged in different jurisdictions./n<neg> @PrestonPysh I had someone tell me "when the United States puts it on their balance sheet." Kinda like saying they wouldn't believe in AAPL until Buffett bought in. Silly./n<pos> I see a lot of people talking about $aapl and sharing long setups recently and like the sentiment. 

Tested some nice support around 119 and I have a position. If we get a rotation into tech, even for a bit, it‚Äôll be a winner./n<pos> Currently long 3/26 AAPL calls.

Price has been hit the past week so I think this can be an attractive entry point. Hoping with stim checks starting to hit some people, we'll see some positive movement in the market this week. Stable enough unlikely to go broke (RIP my GME puts)/n<pos> $AAPL has a $2T market cap. $AMZN is 1.5B. $FCX is 50B and $MOS is 12B. It doesn‚Äôt take a lot of growth repositioning into cyclicals to push their market caps quickly.

$QQQ reached fairly oversold &amp; can still work fine. It always makes sense to look at what else is working too./n<neu> If $aapl makes an EV, that makes them an auto company, they would be valued at more than the sum of all other big autos, so shareholders must sell because the company will be immediately overvalued! Thats how it works right? $TSLA/n<neu> @JGT_Money Smh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôve had conversations with thousands of investors over the past 8 months many of which are long $NIO $TSLA $AAPL/n<neu> 4) I don't plan to actively cover the portfolio on Twitter because we don't make moves in it often, ~1x per year.

(unsure of any AAPL dilution post-1980)/n<neu> @profplum99 Thanks, Mike. Point 1 definitely makes sense intuitively, but I‚Äôm curious how you measure that. As I mentioned in another reply, from what I‚Äôve seen AAPL‚Äôs daily notional trade volume relative to its market cap (and thus relative to its share of passive flow) is actually lower/n<neg> @AltitudeChaz I‚Äôm holding PLTR commons/leaps and aapl commons/leaps.

Technogym is also interesting player in this market. Their equipment are used in about every gym I know and it‚Äôs high quality. Listed in Italy 2 billion market cap./n<neg> @FOofBearTheDog @profplum99 notional trade volume is actually below average. To me, that suggests that the index flows (that are presumably price-insensitive) account for a smaller portion of total volume, so it‚Äôs impact on AAPL‚Äôs price should actually be diluted compared to something where passive/n<neu> @FOofBearTheDog @profplum99 there‚Äôs definitely not a perfect correlation, but it‚Äôs not clear to me that this manifests itself as reinforcing price momentum.

Swinging the rest of $TSLA $FB $BA Have a good night guys! üòâüí∏/n<neg> @RetirementWrong @TheMarkCooke $AAPL/ $AMZN and even $WMT/ $COST are likely to report YoY and MoM profit declines each earnings after Q3 this year. Revenue is whatever, because of all the printing, but inflation hurts their bottom line. 

I'd take a cash pile over money-burning "innovation."

Money talks./n<neu> @jeremy10garrett On social media everyone is a millionaire stock guru. No one posts or talks about their losses. I bought a significant amount of AAPL at $131, I'm currently taking losses but we hold. It just is what it is, can't pay attention to all that stuff/n<pos> $AAPL still needs $126 for full reversal. Taking some time but I think it‚Äôll get there. 

Apple is up 2%+ on the day with nice price action for big tech at the moment./n<neu> @TheSkeptic21 Bought AAPL August 2003 c$20 (split adjusted $0.35), sold August 2005 c$57 (split adjusted $2.04) in 2005

Would have 56,000 shares if I'd held on/n<pos> If $AAPL holds up I think $TSLA should follow to test highs of day ~ 712-713 now 703/n<neu> @jimcramer AAP member here. #AAPL currently represents 20% of my $100k Roth IRA portfolio. This clearly exceeds the percentage of any individual stock owned by the trust. Should I trim or is Apple a stock to hold at any percent?/n<pos> $FB pop near 272 level, now above. Needs above 275 next.
$AAPL back above 123, looks like it can get back to the highs
$SNOW basing above 240 still
$NVDA there is the pop I mentioned. Up 1.50+ quickly. Get to 525 next./n<neg> Have 125 $AAPL calls but I don‚Äôt know if I bought enough time to make it to my 135.50 target this ol gal moving like a snail these days üêå/n<neu> Long $AAPL

Recent consolidation created a possible bull reversal from an overall bear trend. Looking to break resistance at $126.29. After that, $128.29. If unable to break through either I'll liquidate for better entry point to hold.

Overall, Strong long term investment/n<neg> $AAPL chart has been a disaster since #earnings 
It tends to flush out traders,look like it's heading much lower, then pops out of nowhere
To me, the 20 and 100 day moving averages need to be held in order to spark another ATH
$124-$125 is the first important area
then
$129-$130/n<neu> @BahamaBen9 I have to go with heavy one in my portfolio. $AAPL/n<pos> @DrSagarRV I am a long term investor and bullish on the following names:
$TWTR, $SoFi via $IPOE, $CLF, $JMIA, $NIO, $HPE, $AAPL, $GM, $TSLA

Nice run today!!
I swung $CHWY $AAPL and $SNOW

Search my @ followed by a key word to find tickers I may have posted on!

Example "@theatmtrades $AAPL" and then you can see all tweets I've posted with the $AAPL tag./n<pos> actionable plays recently posted on my twitter that I would swing with time.

$MSFT, $AAPL, $FB

$SPY and $QQQ charts still valid./n<neg> @TwinsightPro @aapl just like I mentioned, I believe it is waiting game than to enter. Careful. I lost lots of money on AAPL alerts already/n<pos> @Dividend_Dollar I would have to go with group 2! 

$AMZN is the king of e-commerce and that likely won‚Äôt change. 

$AAPL and $MSFT run the hardware space and I see a lot of upside potential in Apples services segment. 

$BABA is tougher but will get things fixed in time

$ABBV rock solid/n<pos> Bought my second share of Apple (AAPL) today. I ain‚Äôt Jordan Belfort, but slowly acquiring shares of long term stocks I believe in./n<pos> @jedimarkus77 aapl options look normal for me. good morning and good luck!/n<neg> @bon_laetitia I think $aapl letft me, I lost that train at 116 the 8 of mars 
damnnnn/n<neg> My thoughts on oil:

I believe that oil will fall. The target of the $WTI correction is 60 and 58. I expect the shares of those sectors to grow. Growth from $ZM $PLTR $TSLA $CCIV $FRX $AAPL $AMD IS ALREADY WAITING!
Now I would not recommend buying shares in $RIG $CVX $XOM $OXY/n<pos> if you took a scalp off $DOCU or $AAPL congrats! i am day trading or swing $DOCU today :)/n<pos> S/o $aapl paid me good this morning with 4 contracts!!!!/n<neu> @CardinalTrades Yeah, for the most part the rising tide lifts all boats? I can generally tell how my portfolio will do with how $AAPL is doing.  It's a leading indicator too, for how/when things will go.  $AAPL started slipping a few weeks ago, right before everything else crashed./n<pos> What are your favorite #stocks to hold for 30-40 YEARS?
Some I have for long term are...
$aapl
$atvi
$arkw
$arkq 
$fb
$baba 
Let me know what you think maybe tag someone you believe has a good list too./n<pos> @caleb_investTML @bankertradetips @SecretCapital_ I think another sign that Zuck is confident about his AR tech is how vocal he has become against $AAPL recently.  FB AR/VR has about 4mm users right now and critical mass is 10mm. Long runway and head start for $FB. Think about both the social and ecommerce experience/n<neu> @almighty_red You think it‚Äôs a good week for that $125 call in AAPL? Or play it safe w long position. The stock is going up I just don‚Äôt know if I wanna gamble that it‚Äôs this week/n<pos> @SteelerNation_ I prefer non-dividend stocks so I can't give you 5. But I'm bullish on both $MSFT and $AAPL/n<neu> @djblack385 Whenever I can I take some gains and put it into $aapl or $msft or $vti to start taking some risk off the table but keeping some growth. Hard to hold onto cash these days even though it‚Äôs a bubble ya know?/n<neu> $AAPL typically announces events 1 week prior. If no announcement tomorrow and action remains poor below 123 I will cut the last spread that‚Äôs free for whatever it‚Äôs worth for profit./n<pos> @cowboys19surfer Although I think you are batshit crazy to say that, but part of me wants it to be true, I would love me some $AAPL at 90$/n<pos> @jeremymday Given its fund based investing I suspect $TSLA will be helping them the most!üöò

Or maybe $AAPL......üçé/n<pos> @BigBucksBryant $AAPL for me, they've stood the test of time so far and are continuing to innovate/n<pos> @RutiRegan There A TON of finance people on Twitter. And a good number of years back I think someone wrote some Twitter apps that would aggregate news and send it out using $AAPL or similar. I think it was so successful it got absorbed by actual Twitter./n<pos> @wisewizzz @SpencerKSchiff The higher BTC goes, the less often I would move it. I expect 2nd layer tech to make things quick and easy. If I had 10-1 oz. gold coins, I could sell one (with Tx cost), use that 1% in fiat, within PYPL or SQ, and AMZN AAPL and GOOG may also incorporate their own BTC system./n<neu> If we see $150 Billion more $BTC added to public company balance sheets I think that‚Äôs enough to push the price past $250k. A company like $AAPL could account for $10 Billion of that no sweat. 

Question is, how long will it take for enough companies to get on board?/n<neu> Bought some $AAPL bc @Twitter told me to ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü•¥üí∞ü§©/n<neg> @TheAndyKatz @B1GMBBall @IlliniMBB @OhioStateHoops @IlliniAD And I can‚Äôt believe AAPL is a trillion dollar company (but happy with my holdings) with the way that the worst in class iOS autocorrect turns that into they./n<neu> Been working to learn TheStrat the last couple of weeks.  Time to start putting some of what I think I've learned to the test.  Tomorrow's watchlist for me for a swing (going up):  $CCL, $COTY, $FEYE, $CSCO, $INTC, $AAPL, $NNDM

#Trading #TheStrat/n<pos> @NoTimeZone_ I love $aapl and load up every chance I get/n<pos> @fourtyseven_ak I always like to watch AAPL and TSLA to gauge market sentiment. But I will definitely be watching DKNG off PENN inclusion. GRWG. RIOT/MARA/SI/NCTY. Some popular ER tickers like VUZI, CRWD, FCEL, FUTU, GEVO, UPST, MP etc. Going to be a crazy week! Goodluck! ü•∞/n<neg> If I take classes at nova I should have bought stock last month #fuck #aapl/n<pos> I‚Äôm not sure why people haven‚Äôt been talking about it more but $AAPL at $121 is a no brainer. Sometimes I just think the stock market enjoys paying me money./n<neu> I‚Äôll be watching $TSLA $AAPL $PENN to see if it‚Äôs a risk on day and week. 50/50 right now. Not super excited for the growth names but I‚Äôll let the markets and money flow dictate. Retail / banks / energy still in full force. Trade cautious. Be flexible, go with what‚Äôs working./n<neu> @MuzLM_Trader I say $aapl to 155-165 by YE and 175-200 by end of next year and 250 within 2-3 years target. Thoughts ?/n<neu> @JBoyd_TDA I saw that hammer too, same hammer as for AAPL and TSLA/n<pos> @Molson_Hart I read that analysis you posted earlier.  sounds like amazon could give aapl a run for its money in a few years for cash.

Considering buying more./n<neu> Potential buys for me tomorrow morning - $SINO | $RIOT | $AAPL/n<neu> @jhartmanil @saxena_puru @vijucat You cannot go wrong when you do this consistently. But choosing the stocks is a tricky thing because you don‚Äôt want to be in 1000 different ones. These are the ones I have : TSLA, Cannabis ETF, QS, FLGT, APPN, OKTA, ABNB, AAPL, FVRR, SHOP, MRNA, ZM, PINS, FUBO, PLTR, NET, LMND/n<neu> If you have $1700 to buy stocks for the immediate/longterm what would you buy? 

If it were me I would buy: 

2 shares of AAPL = ~$250
30 shares of PLTR = ~$850
2 shares of IIPR = ~$400 
3 shares of LMND = ~$300/n<neu> #nanoinvestment #nanoinvesting survey:

Apple has profit share, but so much is riding on the iPhone (half of Apple revenue).

Especially since the people are starting to realize they can take on the investment firms./n<neu> What‚Äôs with all these financial institutions who give these extreme price guesses on stocks?

Just seen an evaluation of $AAPL on CNBC:

Bull case: $430

Bear case: $80

Both are so removed from the current price, how does that help me? 

Comes across as guessing, I can do that./n<neg> I don't recommend buying this bounce.  My charts say it's counter-trend.

It is a stock I do not plan on trading. My largest individual holding by far./n<neu> #NuclearDailyRecap

Only played one play today and that was the $AAPL put which we made 41% on today.

I will post an overview of my thought process on that trade in a little bit.

#TheStampede/n<neu> @Market There is no such thing as bulletproof stock ... there is always risk, rotation, competition, etc. I would say AAPL ... I see TSLA the next AAPL as they expand and innovate/n<neg> @stock_mj This makes zero sense - share count isn't the determinant of dilution. It is capital raised relative to the company's market cap. Example: AAPL has 16.8 billion shares outstanding; it also has a market cap of over $2 trillion so who cares./n<pos> @Market Great exercise Rick. Something everyone should do when analyzing a stock. Next step: Which one of the bearish counters is weakest/least likely? I‚Äôm going with $AAPL/n<pos> @MagnarelliMark that I‚Äôm extremely bullish on all for a small premium? Risk = having to sell 100 shares of AAPL at a discount. Reward = small premium/n<neg> @MagnarelliMark Risk/reward seems like a poor proposition selling covered calls, no? It‚Äôs basically a hedge. If I own AAPL, for example, I‚Äôm bullish on it. So, why would I want to sell a covered call and risk having to give up 100 shares (that‚Äôs even IF I owned 100 shares) of a company.../n<pos> @BackpackerFI @mukund IMO the best acquisition to date is $AAPL acquiring Steve Jobs , sorry NeXT Inc

For me that acquisition makes the 2T company what it is today/n<neg> Can anyone tell why ARK made the following transactions today?

- Sold 1 share of $SPLK
- Sold 2 shares of $ROK
- Sold 4 shares of $HIMS
- Sold 5 shares of $AAPL
- Sold 7 shares of $FLIR

Make me worried that it, too, needs the $1,400 stimulus checküòÇ./n<pos> $FB, $AMZN, $AAPL, $NFLX, $GOOG have clearly been massive winners since the GFC of 08/9.

Who are the next FAANG?  Who wins big tech over the next decade?

Is it really the 10 yr yield pressuring here? Maybe some other behind the scenes stuff?

I've heard other technicians say "watch $AAPL &amp; $TSLA for market direction"

Your thoughts @LloydBoyLuke ?

Cheers from upper Manhattan/n<neg> I still can‚Äôt believe $AAPL got rid of the MagSafe charger on laptops. What an unbelievably stupid decision. #Apple/n<pos> These Algorithms do what they do and the people follow. The sentiment will change.

Until then I am trying to get them $AAPL March 2023 170 calls at a even better price. #stickingtothescript/n<pos> @bleacherbum23 Based on industry news &amp; trends, I expect a sequence of events indicating MicroOLED backplane sales ramp as we move through 2021 in advance of new #VR devices from Apple, HTC, Sony, Oculus, Panasonic, Pico and others.

Now +1.75%

Long-term perspective $AAPL $TSLA $SQ $PYPL $BABA $AMZN/n<neg> $AAPL well this is one stock I can‚Äôt call anyone a bag holder. No matter where you buy eventually it turns into a good buy.

Mostly small speculative stuff, but a bunch of positions are hedges since my biggest LONGS are TSLA &amp; AAPL by far. Also hedging for other stocks I have in some "non trading" accounts./n<neg> @saxena_puru Such good in advice. Time in the market matters more than timing the market?

An AAPL holder who, for the last 6 years has been told the value is too high./n<neu> @jimcramer To be sure. I have a friend who bought AAPL in either late 80s/early 90s. Never sold a share.

He has a cost basis of about 25 cents. Some ridiculous number of shares worth +$5 million, maybe more.

His financial advisor keeps trying to get him to sell some for diversification./n<neg> @SardonicCanuck Either Epic has a long-term plan to run third-party game storefronts on mobile or consoles ( $AAPL and console makers will fight them tooth and nail to keep their gatekeeper role) or I don‚Äôt see the time and effort for their lawsuits.

Fortnite doesn‚Äôt need iOS to succeed./n<neg> @SardonicCanuck The cash flow from Fortnite alone should keep them going for years to come. I don‚Äôt get why they need to raise funds (and if they do, why ‚Äúonly‚Äù $1 billion...)?

Well, I don‚Äôt understand many things about Epic. Eg. the lawsuit vs $AAPL, Fortnite doesn‚Äôt play well on touch anyway./n<neg> @JonathanGuito @CathieDWood @TashaARK @skorusARK @wintonARK You are comparing $AAPL and $AMZN with $TSLA ü§°ü§°ü§°

Yes, had quite a few nice Day Trade setups for Long and shorts. But it is still mostly a Day trading session for me. Only few swing positions started today: $RH $AAPL $BOX. 

The fade on the $QQQ (failed at 50d again) and $SPY still shows some weakness./n<neu> In order for me to be bullish on equities in the Short Term; I need to see a LARGE bid in big cap tech.

If the broader market rallies and big tech ranges; I'm bearish.

$AAPL $AMZN $FB could be in a distribution cycle at the moment
$GOOGL is still strong.

I let price guide me./n<neg> @bringevidence @akramsrazor @TwitterSpaces Also I could be wrong but I dont think TWTR has opened it up to all AAPL users yet either. I think so far they have limited the number of people who can host. Could be wrong on that part though./n<pos> @SkolCapital Interesting jumping into AMZN.  I like AAPL and FB better right now. My favorite long hold of 2020 is $POAHY. 

Plan to hold and rebuy through the great EV wars of the 20s.

I trust @jack with my money üòÅ/n<neu> After $TSLA, I scalped $QQQ and $AAPL calls (once stopped out of AAPL before it ripped and worked on second try). Later I rolled out smaller to 4/1 calls for TSLA, but it dumped EOD, so maybe that was it for TSLA for now./n<neu> @jralvarez013 @NEOstockhacker @tanctran @Vemanti Mr, Alvarez, every stock is a pump, is just a matter of how or when. It's easy for me, charts look bullish, financials matter when? AMZN? TSLA? AAPL? Apple had a a record blow out. Look at that crappy chart.

I love the way that Teslemmings always compare $TSLA to $AAPL. $AAPL defends its patents like a mother bear defends its cubs. $TSLA makes its patents "open source."

They should buy WHOOP, but I hear they're valued at $1B+ already/n<neg> @BackpackerFI @TheMarkCooke @BahamaBen9 @Innovestor_ @fatbabyfunds Cause sometimes I think $AAPL lacks innovation and just stacks cash cause they don‚Äôt know what to do with it.

But $TSLA is no $AAPL, which only faced ~3 rivals.

I see a 3-2-2 Bullish reversal and was thinking 120 calls. Would appreciate ur insight.../n<neu> When I was 9, I earned money from a television commercial, I wanted to put it into a stock when I was 13, but my parents said no. I wanted to put it into AAPL. ~900 dollars. In the same time period my mom put her money into Pfizer. Guess which stock did better./n<neu> @ricotheweddings @Gambiste1 Yeah, IMO $AAPL if it's EV comes out in 2024 as rumored will double in value.  After the split I sold 50% of my $AAPL and still maintained x2 of my original shrs.  So I'll now hold for mid year 2024 for now on my remainder./n<pos> @JeffreyAWillia4 @Gambiste1 Yeah I feel comfortable holding onto aapl also. Good track record. Hopefully we will all prosper for April/n<neu> @LiviamCapital @ycharts You are correct

I am such a dumbass, made a mistake, forgot that $AAPL ‚Äòs year end is Sep

So I was looking at FY20

It is indeed correct for TTM to Dec 20. CFO $88.9B, capex $8.7B, which is $80.2B

Apologies @ycharts , please ignore my previous tweet, I made a mistake/n<neu> @LiviamCapital It‚Äôs TTM (last 4 quarters)

Their definition of FCF (I checked) is CFO minus capex

Strange though because in $AAPL ‚Äòs case, they say FCF is $80.2B

But $AAPL CFO for 2020 was $80.7B and capex was $7.3B, so FCF by their definition shld be $73.4B ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> @LiviamCapital I'd rather see $aapl have higher capex and higher growth.  Looking at the list, capex seems in line with respective growth rates./n<neu> I need $aapl to shoot towards 124 before 3/31 so I can sell this call and breakeven./n<neg> @MikeEdward_TTG can you plz stop buying up so many Ads on YouTube??

I didn't say $1T entering "the system" on any given day, I said $1T goes into a "total market index fund."

Let me know ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è/n<pos> @IrnestKaplan @10kdiver They are the truly great businesses! I own a few, including $AAPL that increase earnings  while deceasing capital. The numbers become almost irrelevant, generally i want them to have as high a reinvestment rate as possible to leverage the ROIIC.
(yes, add debt. Deduct buybacks)/n<neu> So Return on incremental capital is negative 12.5%.

Questions for @10kdiver if I may
1) are my calcs correct?
2) what do you do when capital decreases?
3) is it correct to subtract buybacks &amp; add in debt issuance?

Either way $AAPL is special.
More earnings on less capital!

It will be like Apple vs Android all over again.

Tesla is Apple in this example, except there still isn‚Äôt an Android yet.

TSLA shareholders should fear GOOG, AAPL, AMZN and no one else./n<neg> @philgrahambiz @saxena_puru $AAPL PE=33 (5 yr mean = 20)
$AMZN PE = 73 (5 yr mean = 151)
$FB PE = 28 (5 yr mean = 34.5)

I disagree these are WAY undervalued. $AAPL is overvalued. $AMZN could be undervalued but as Covid improves, I think earnings will be reduced. 

$QQQ is valued around the same as 1999./n<neu> @ClausSorensen @saxena_puru That's why I stick with undervalued safe companies like $AMZN, $AAPL, etc./n<neg> @chasericker3 @MarioBerky @QTRResearch Yes, I need a class on portfolio management because it was I, and clearly not you, that referred to $AAPL as a "portfolio"./n<pos> @OffTheGecko @Jedi_ant Well, we had almost 50% move in $AAPL when they did stock split.

Not anything to worry about right now but earnings on apple is 4/29./n<pos> Slow day, no big plays. Overall ok because of a good call on $TSLA. I will take a green day on such an uneventful day.

First off is @grifinapp and since it trades based off real life transactions it will be placing trades for $AAPL, $KR, $MS, $MSFT, $VZ, $WF &amp; $WMT #stocks/n<pos> @cryptorecruitr That‚Äôs good because I like #ADA but I‚Äôm tired of waiting for it to get better than AAPL at breaking ATH/n<neu> @StockMKTNewz Buy the underperformers . AAPL is gonna sore. Not sure what the catalyst will be, but I know it's coming!!!!!/n<neu> Let me know what #charts you want me to go over. 

$SPX $QQQ $GOOGL $BIDU $AMZN $TWTR $AAPL $AMZN $TWLO $TSLA $NIO $FB #ES_F #Bitcoin/n<pos> @MoneyJrod The only real winner I've ever bought was AAPL. Still buying!/n<pos> @FinancialHamst1 Great read.  For me, it's $AAPL, $MSFT and $AMZN.  $DIS being a close forth./n<neg> Many ask me how Adam Jonas is the #3 rated analyst on $TSLA when he‚Äôs often negative. Toni Sacconaghi #1 on $AAPL is the same. That‚Äôs a big diff between institut‚Äôl and retail investors. Ptf  mgrs like analysts who are bullish AND quantify the risks. Many retail investors hate it./n<neu> @MuzLM_Trader I‚Äôm thinking $AMZN makes more sense than $AAPL here. I think Apple may be a little too skittish to publicly do business with a majority Saudi-owned company./n<pos> @The_Stoic_Joe @mukund I was going to say the exact same thing. Price is what you see now - both are competing against other players. I own both - I own $AAPL for its future service revenues from TV+, Arcade ‚Ä¶, and $MSFT for its ability to keep strengthening enterprise community/n<neu> @vandrewattycpa @statusquont @SunfedBryan oh wait, maybe I misunderstood. If I have a Roth with GBTC or MSTR or AAPL in it, I can somehow "swap" those for BTC that I own on a private wallet? But then can I do that within a system like Vanguard or Fidelity or whatever, or do I have to "self-manage" in some kluged setup?/n<pos> @BahamaBen9 $ROKU - and I have non-intelligent reasons.

-Almost everyone I know has one. (reminds me of $AAPL and the iPhone)

-Walked into an electronics department not long ago and every direction I turned... Roku everywhere.

-I got the new Roku sound bar and it slaps/n<neg> @parkeralewis I can‚Äôt pay with AAPL stock. Big key difference./n<pos> @wolfofwallst All I own is AAPL so I‚Äôm hoping for a crash so I can add an obscene amount of shares for real cheap!!!/n<neu> @AlwinSW @SawyerMerritt I will stay where I am at 60% $TSLA , 15% my 401K , 8% Managed , 5% AAPL , 12% in other individual stocks like $CRSP, $KO, $WMT, $AMZN, $FB, $MSFT/n<pos> @strive98933134 @SawyerMerritt I maybe wrong, but I may my decision long time ago and made money on leaps by being 100% in $AAPL. Same thing happened to me with $TSLA in 2020.
2022-2023 will be even more fantastic./n<neg> Adding $nflx to my list of shorts when we eventually have a major correction. So far I have $tsla $aapl and now $nflx. Nflx competition is growing too fast and their margins aren‚Äôt even good to begin with to justify 90 P/E ratio. It‚Äôs worth 150b tops/n<neu> @erikcbutler I wholeheartedly disagree. Next leg up imo comes from rotation into reasonable priced growth as in 10x revs or so growing 25%+ and big cap tech imo. Could be wrong but $amzn and $aapl bout to go on massive run and $fb already confirming as well as $msft and $goog./n<neu> @TopStockMan It was pretty flat today but I do like both stocks for long plays, I‚Äôm out of $hofv entirely til it stops dropping, so I grabbed some $aapl to see something green for a change üòÇ/n<pos> @NStocks96 I loved the Bulllish buying today on tech. Although there was some odd pout buying for $AAPL and $TSLA long dated  late 21 and 2022 and ridiculous strikes 75 for and 400. Big bets million - 4 million/n<neg> It may be bloody when banks declare their real  losses in #archegoscapital very soon, I don't understand why $ES is bid when there is such an imminent risk, not including the NATO war against #Russia in #Ukraine $ES $SPY $QQQ #stocks #StockMarket  $AAPL $TSLA $AMZN $FB $MSFT/n<neg> @marketplunger1 I‚Äôm too dumb to understand his new positions. I can see $PDD ‚Äòs growth, including the recent group grocery delivery, but this company is not cheap at all. And $AAPL at this price?/n<neu> $AAPL have we missed anything long?

3/1 plan given Buffett news +4
3/8 plan given 116&gt; 127 1 week later 
3/31 went long 121.8 &amp; knew 123.5 resistance 

Today another chance long &gt; 124. Now 126.25. Am I genius? No I just understand the flow./n<neg> @01stocksavage I knew about the $GME spike before it hit, and knew it wasn't going to survive.  There's not enough there to warrant the price.  I don't like riding roller coasters with my money.  I'd rather long haul it. $AMZ $BRK.A $AAPL/n<neu> @micahgoulart @christi10006880 @ParrotStock Yeah that totally makes sense. It was odd last month when FAANG was down due to high yields. $aapl has $200b in cash and mints money./n<neu> @ParrotStock I am up $1,807 or 0.29% today.

Winners: $AAPL $MSFT $AQN $PLTR
Losers: $ACUIF $MWK $TIGR $ABBV/n<neg> Hey @tim_cook - half the calls I get say "scam likely" in the ID.  How about you just block those... Thanks. $AAPL @Apple/n<pos> @ChartsWithBret Excited for $AAPL and $PLTR as I'm long on both of them./n<neu> Right now I've got my mind set on $AAPL $HOME $CHWY $NLOK for this week./n<pos> At least a few of these did well 

I traded $FB $MSFT $INTC $AAPL and $PINS

I‚Äôm holding long term calls on $PINS and have taken a swing on $CCIV (prematurely I think, but tomorrow will tell)/n<neu> @StealthQE4 I mean aapl is bound to rise leading into earnings. Got some baidu calls for some Hwang alpha/n<neu> Check out the newest #YouTube video!

Working well/n<pos> @BahamaBen9 I was pretty excited when he agreed with Kara Swisher's suggestion that AR would be ‚Äúcritically important" to Apple's future in that NYT interview. $FB vs $MSFT vs $AAPL -&gt; The AR / VR war between these giants are certainly coming, consumers should be excited./n<pos> @JohnSJohnson17 @thinkorswim Nice! Yeah I was filled on some AAPL &amp; FB calls today./n<neu> I missed the first 3 hrs of the market open. Huge moves on $AAPL $FB $MSFT. I did NOT catch any of those. Don't get worried if you miss plays like that. It wouldve been nice, yes, but there are plenty opportunities.

I took 2 trades today:
$AMD long shares
$TSLA scalp calls/n<neg> $SPY $SEER $TSLA $AAPL the winners for me today. Still holding $GOGO and $NNOX which sold off as soon as market opened, but if you didn‚Äôt shave some at $70 this am well... 

$ONDS broke under a crucial line so my trade is invalid, and I‚Äôm on the wrong side of $HD at the moment./n<neg> @asymmetricalpha $AAPL, $WMT, $CRM and $SHOP for me. $BABA good here too but the news is killing that stock/n<pos> @ThetaWarrior Very good picks and clear charts! Thank you for sharing!! Could you please let me know what do the $1.68, $0.205, the light and the red phone indicate in the AAPL chart ? Thanks/n<pos> With tech running I feel good about $aapl coming back to the $130s.
Will chart everything tonight after the market closes/n<neu> $AAPL $FB $MSFT $PYPL what a day. Sold $FB near its high for the day. Plan to exit $AAPL &amp; $MSFT before close. If $MSFT close above $250 I plan to hold 1/3 position.

Thank me later/n<neu> $AAPL is also in my portfolio.. Why?

Because I‚Äôm typing this tweet using an iPhoneüì±/n<pos> @TD_Investor @BusinessFamous I like the division of these dividend stocks into growth, highyield, and bluechips. Are you balanced according to TD_Investor's groups? 
I own:
$V  -growth

$MO, $T -high yield

$AAPL, $MCD  -blue chip:  Generally, a stock is considered a bluechip if it enters the DJIA/n<neu> Still concerned about the imbalance between small caps and indices though. I will continue to keep tight SL as I feel skeptical about the strength of small caps right now. 

Take profits and trade with a plan!

I opened my account within a week of one another so my memory may not be the best/n<neu> Didn't I tell u guys...... $TSLA Pull back $10 to $15 today.   It can't be up to high today.  Then  after quarter report $1200/share . $AAPL Is going to work with Elon later. ?????

Tim Cook drops some hints on Apple's car plans, shares what he thinks of Elon Musk and Tesla/n<neu> I will bet my 409k portfolio that $AAPL close under 125 today/n<neu> I believe a sell will come by April 16th $SPY $QQQ $AAPL $TSLA $AMZN/n<neu> I have to wonder if the rest of FANG is at all time highs, matter of time before $AAPL joins in? ü§î/n<neg> Will $aapl play catchup to the rest of the FAANG stocks. still an ugly looking chart with price below a downtrending 50 SMA. Rarely are these good risk reward scenarios. i am long small for the catch up trade but will be quick to exit./n<pos> Sold my $AAPL calls this morning for a tidy 30% overall profit after they had dipped to a 50% loss last week. Now I‚Äôm looking for a red day or two so I can rebuy with an expiration date in early may. April is gonna be huge for tech rebound. $SPY I‚Äôm not sure though/n<neg> $aapl $msft $amzn $goog $fb

I keep saying. it‚Äôs the $TSLA of AR, the $AAPL of NextGen devices/n<neu> Done for the day.

Gonna pick some 4/9 calls up if it confirms/n<pos> @FT_Trades Thanks for head up on $AAPL. I hope so. Was looking good places to short $NQ and $ES.... Or at least a very good swing entry for long/n<neg> You do NOT! I WILL REPEAT! YOU DO NOT WANT IT TO HAPPENED THIS EARNINGS THAT IS COMING UP! A healthy PULLBACk would be perfect for those that know a BULLISH RUN is coming. Social media Traders are going to on üî• Y'all! Fattening Season

$AAPL is currently $225.40/n<neu> Folks, this is the Bullish RUN I was telling y'all that was coming B4 the STORM! This normally happens wks going into Earnings. Keep an eye on $AAPL! This RUN could happen next Earnings?/n<pos> @iamtomnash I just think this is a great move by $AAPL coming down from their high horse working towards their 2030 vision/n<neu> $AAPL everyone rotating into value and infrastructure and reopeninng  stocks. With bond yields higher and inflation rising people have rotated out of the fangs . They will be sorry when I -Car is announced. Cook has lots of ex Tesla people working on this gem now./n<pos> After locking nice gains in $AAPL, just watching this strength in the market.

It's a stock I will likely keep buying over the course of why whole life./n<neg> @HotNewHipHop After reading this article &amp; the one on the 2017 robbery I have concerns (not meant to discredit the AAPL community)

Concern 1: "hip-hop made me do it" is still a legit defense in court

Concern 2: YG's content stylizing violence against his own people isn't getting removed/n<neu> The number of businesses that are not competitors with one of $AMZN, $GOOG, $MSFT, $FB or $AAPL feels like it is dwindling fast. Makes sense as these companies are already 20% of the value of the S&amp;P 500./n<pos> I hope everyone is having a nice start to the week.

I haven't done much but watch $SOS $FTFT $OLB $AMD $AAPL $BTC $DOGE

Risk and profit management is one of the areas I struggle with the most, I placed the order / canceled the order a few times before committing to taking profit by hitting that sell button. $AAPL has tons of room, waiting for the next pullback./n<pos> Good to see everything hitting new highs now let's hit some lows so I can get me a position! $AAPL $PLTR  $NIO/n<pos> The successful are successful because they are willing to put in more time mastering their craft than the rest. 

I put in over two hours of work into analyzing charts yesterday. Did you? $SPY $FB $MSFT $AAPL $PLTR/n<pos> $AAPL big things coming this month!!!! Product launch and dividend increase, share buybacks plus services are ramping up for Apple. A WIN WIN WIN situation. I like WINNING!!!!!!!/n<pos> So many freaking alerts I can‚Äôt even catch up.

Great start so far. Ideally if $AAPL can consolidate a bit near 125, I see it getting to 128+ by end of this week. Big tech is very strong today so far./n<pos> Extended to July and September $ORCL calls. I have a feeling. Almost at new ATH so I will be adding more to my position as we pullback later this week/month.

Stock was 140ish last earnings
Buffett sold too soon/n<neg> $AAPL way overvalued up here. Services was supposed take up almost 80% of the revenue by this summer and they are still dependent on the iPhone to generate the bulk of everything. All the P/E is fabricated by buybacks.

For that reason, I'm now short./n<neu> I have simple rules about weekly options on #FAANGS $AMZN $NFLX $AAPL $FB $GOOGL or $TSLA .Buy only on Mon for a thesis or Fri for a lotto, and at P&lt;=1%xStk P on Mon, .1%xStk P on Fri.

"We're interested in the integration of hardware, software, and services," 

Makes it seem like they will attempt some sort of "full stack Uber/DASH" rather than becoming an OEM or selling software to OEMs./n<pos> Sold just over 1/4 of my $AAPL. It's escaped it's EMAs by quite a bit. As soon as we touch the 21 I'm back in.

yours... another tweet to bookmark/n<neg> $AAPL goes up with a PT decrease, $AZN goes up on bad news‚Ä¶.. nothing makes sense anymore./n<neu> There are a few stocks that I have in my radar this morning @StacTrading. I‚Äôll be keeping an eye on:

$AMC $BTX $SPY $AAPL $NCLH

#DayTrading #StockMarket/n<pos> Back in the lineup after a 24-hour IL stint.  Looks like I missed out on the fun Monday, market cooling off this morning from its latest record highs #DOW -40   $AAPL &amp; $TSLA each up slightly after big gains yesterday/n<neg> @MacroCharts I had a look at call options for AAPL as I wanted to sell them and the premiums were in the toilet - so not worth selling them. Sounds like it's similar for tech in general. I think that the sideways nature of tech a few months ago was due to too much options interest./n<neu> @rodeopart3 I have been pondering this a lot lately. When you are already locked into the apple ecosystem, and conditioned to buy their hardware, are you really going to go out and buy an oculus? $aapl already has the retail distribution in prime locations../n<neg> @HeroDividend I believe it was AAPL but as a CFD. Needless to say I don't have that anymore./n<neg> @JohnH_BBT $AAPL chopped me up yesterday too. I lost out by about a penny before it went long. Doh!/n<pos> $AAPL I‚Äôm getting the new iPad Pro whenever it‚Äôs released. That mini-led tech is gunna work wonders when I watch the mandalorian on $DIS plus/n<pos> @Wynzi87 So you are saying that when a company achieves its full potential its P/E is going to be 40? I think it‚Äôs quite high tbh

$AAPL trailing P/E: 34
$FB trailing P/E: 30
$GOOG trailing P/E: 38

These companies still have lots of room to grow and none of them has a P/E of 40/n<neu> @BahamaBen9 35% funds (ARK, QQQ)
20% mega tech (AAPL, GOOGL, FB, CRM, MSFT)
40% Growth
5% Crypto (I've just started this one, GBTC and ETHE)/n<pos> @JoachimKlement That‚Äôs the reason why I give a kudos to Warren Buffett. He has never been become too old to learn (dumped $GE, $IBM, oil - loaded up with $AAPL, $AMZN) whereas old dogs still dream of gold, banks, oil, cocoa and hyperinflation./n<neg> @Pauljamesgallo I‚Äôll sell $AAPL when I die./n<neu> @TraderJ95886811 Bahahahha you can tweet all the tickets to me. You still holding those $AAPL calls?/n<neu> @jsvd87 @BenAltitude Market entry, limit exit, with or without Strat setup. If SPY, QQQ, IWM, AAPL, etc. liquid names, then automatic trailing stop. For these quickies at the open, I set a sell limit order for fast 10% profit, but sizing up lately. Can scale out on higher time frame trades later./n<pos> $AAPL CEO Tim cook on $TSLA

"I think Tesla has done an unbelievable job of not only establishing the lead, but keeping the lead for such a long period of time in the EV space,"/n<pos> Futures slightly red but I think the green April run continues, watch them shift in a few hours! $AAPL/n<pos> Based on the amount of $aapl promotion around iPhone 12, it likely suggests the iPhone 13 will have something they makes it a must have/n<pos> @OLKing33 I'm with you! $AAPL is the gift that keeps on giving - I cashed out after the crazy run up but had to jump back in for more. Strong bullish finish to the day, let's see what kind of momentum it can get tomorrow./n<neg> @GerberKawasaki Sold some $AAPL to buy more $TSLA. Didn‚Äôt pull the trigger today though.  I‚Äôm overthinking!/n<neu> @TeslaLarry @Poxenium @theweekafternxt @CNBC I made below avg returns since 2018, but retired off 90s investment in MSFT, 04/05 investment in AAPL, companies one could actually value. Some AMZN too.
Investing in AMZN pre AWS and TSLA pre Q4, 19 was just gambling.

I think we see a similar run from $TSLA over the next few years./n<pos> @StockQueenie Yes AAPL come thru, I hope you a still on the rise tomorrow!/n<pos> @ExploitForward I am expecting a big beat for $AAPL this Q1 quarter. People got those stims and Apple products are a good place to spend on! üòÄ ... iPhones and laptops and watches and tablets! List goes on!/n<neg> @mars_weed AAPL business model is far different than TSLA... we saw how they rolled out apple maps- based on a legacy mapping company.  I don't think AAPL can really develop anything in house- it all relies on external parties and if they had procured TSLA it would have been a disaster./n<neu> We have a sell up to a 12hr chart 

For perspective the amzn, aapl and msft calls I made last week were based off an hourly signal

I am looking for a daily signal here

To say we are overextended, is quite literally, an understatement

These sorts of moves are extremely rare/n<neu> My brain keeps telling me to short $AAPL here. 

But my portfolio keeps denying it. 

Exceed covid comps, 

Yields rising. 

Why is $AAPL bullish right now ?/n<pos> @DivCultivator @CalebGregory304 Fun. I like looking on my $AAPL devices to see what I might buy on $ebay and pay for with $PYPL or BTC. Also check flights to $DIS, and my accounts at $GS, or book rooms at $MGM or $WYNN.  Could go on all day, but I need an $SBUX./n<neu> @FranklinSaint84 I stay away from blue chip stocks unless I‚Äôm swinging options 

There‚Äôs been opportunities to scalp $AAPL but the market conditions doesn‚Äôt support my options swing strategy

Elon already gave a hint TSLA will be bigger than AAPL in greater than 0 months.

I am super tempted to discuss about the T smart phone, which could be named as tPhone!

My top dividend stocks are $AAPL, $MSFT, $ABBV, $JNJ, $LMT among others.

#groundfloorgang/n<pos> $AAPL has made a nice move off the 200sma and is now climbing back above the 50sma. I have a position in my long term account./n<pos> Today I‚Äôll be focusing on tech, tech, and more tech! Here‚Äôs my watchlist @StacTrading :

$AAPL $FB $MSFT $QQQ $NVDA/n<neg> not me selling AAPL yesterday before close and now it‚Äôs damn near almost at $129. i‚Äôm sick ü§¢/n<neu> Watchlist:
$AAPL on weekly breakout watch over $129
$SHOP tight price range breakout, calls can work over $1180 see chart from yesterday for reference
$ROKU if it can hold above $370 at open consider calls
others I'm watching: $SQ, $NVDA, $AMZN/n<pos> GM Stratters! Market looks to open higher. $AAPL swing working nicely, $TSLA not so much so I exited and covered loss by shorting the stock yesterday. Watching: $AAPL $ADBE $DOCU $LRCX $NVDA $ROKU $NFLX #theStrat/n<pos> $CCiV  Its great to see Lucids CEO publish great videos driving Lucids.     
Investors say could be 30 by a certain date. 
I believe CCiV could run at any time on news.

Great investment! Short &amp; Long Term.

What‚Äôs the easiest way for me to follow your strategy?

Me:
Once a month sell a put or call on $AAPL and collect 2-3% premium

Can you?

Cheers! üçª HAGW!/n<neg> @jpr007 I remember objecting to a previous thread you did on AAPL b/c I felt you were missing forest for the trees, but this analysis is spot on. AAPL is worth owning for its consistency, but IMO they‚Äôve wasted $200+ billion in stock buybacks instead of, you know, investing for future./n<neu> @SeanEnjoying @jpr007 Fair.

I remember you mentioning that it was a stock people invest in because they are comfortable with it, but longer term expected it to fade./n<pos> @MPortfolios @Brokenmkt @davebudge I am expecting a pullback/correction in the next week or two. After that idk maybe nh's. 

AMZN and AAPL charts look great LT but ST extended, GOOGL and MSFT both need a break soon as well. TSLA just looks bleh.

idk who these guys pass the baton to for the market to go higher/n<neu> @acali07 @fs_insight @fundstrat Likewise. I opted for mnth 2 mnth. But same question lingers. To follow FSInsight either u bring fresh cash or you rotate existing positions (sell). Don‚Äôt want to sell many long terms like $AAPL $NFLX $AMZN $TSLA.

Simple one today...Will the NASDAQ 100 be positive today by end of show, 11:30 am est?üìà
@traderTVLIVE $aapl $tsla $msft $fb $googl/n<pos> Enjoy the weekend everyone. No trading for me today, but I will begin sharing real-time trades here within the next few trading days. $SPY $QQQ $AAPL $MSFT $TWTR #fintwit/n<neu> @RedDogT3 when I hopped on this am you were kicking to with your dog.last night  Not too much down time, here either. im sticking w Aapl amzn shop. have snow but down need 244 break. #tradewell/n<neu> @massumeh18 I like both but am curious how the chip shortage will play out for $AAPL. They just delayed new laptops and computers if I am remembering correctly/n<neu> @349Trading do you anticipate another Bitcoin dip like a few weeks ago. I‚Äôm looking to take some profit off of Mara and hop into AAPL or DIS. I caught the last dip and was able to grab 11 shares at 37.33. I don‚Äôt want to completely take myself out of the game with MARA./n<neu> @natehousekey @jojosephCardona @PramilaJayapal AFAIK, I‚Äôve only increased the wealth of billionaires voluntarily (e.g., AMZN, AAPL, WMT). Do you have evidence that billionaires haven taken wealth from you involuntarily?/n<neu> Ok, here you go. Disclaimer, I'm in a bunch of these already from one of my previous posts. 

Some of these still need to break resistance, but if/when they do, you're gonna want to have eyes on them
$AAPL $DDOG $TWTR $VALE $ORCL $EBAY $GDX $PINS $UBER $WPM $HSBC/n<neu> Picked me up some $AAPL &amp; $TSLA calls, locked and loaded for tomorrow babyü¶ß/n<pos> @yocline an S&amp;P index fund would have beat that return by almost 2x last year. I hear #aapl #goog &amp; #FB also did prety well/n<pos> Been building up my options in $NVDA $CRM $AMD and $AAPL. 1-3 months out. $CRM held strong all day, coiling getting ready to spring. $AMD also. When building your calls, layer them out by at least 2 weeks. Makes it easier to unload some while keeping others. Build up and out!/n<neu> @team3dstocks I can relate. I would think this is something I should‚Äôve known or been very aware too but i really took time tracking trades over this quarter and my win percentage trading AAPL and any trade after 11am my win rate is nearly 0%. Really could‚Äôve saved me some losses/n<neu> Watchlist for 4/9

Will be playing most of these like scalps. 0dte on most.
I already have a position in $AAL with 4-23-21 exp.

$GOEV - over 10.65, PT 11.65
$ROKU - over 378, PT 385
$AAL - over 24, PT 24.60

$AAPL - over 131, PT 133

$SPY #options #LOTTO/n<pos> @GreenTreeRd1 Aapl looks good I loaded 130's today. When you mentioned 131's I smiled. And HELD. 

NQ futures wow! Es futures wow!/n<neu> @rocko_uncle I‚Äôd sell way out of money naked puts on CVS and AAPL and collect premium and be fine if stock put to me at those levels. Why limit your upside if you like the stock for long term?/n<neu> My mic came in. I don't have much experience making (Youtube) videos. But I'm going to start recording my thoughts on $ES_F $SPY $NQ_F $QQQ and other common names on my main trade list $AAPL $FB $MSFT $TSLA etc etc. I'm going to give this a go./n<pos> @traderDanielle I picked up some AAPL flys. Thanks for your suggestion. :)/n<pos> @ProblemSniper I love the strength of AAPL this week. Not a lotto play but I want the strength to continue./n<neu> @LudtkeTim @gurgavin I‚Äôm in the same boat with AAPL, I wrote 30 contracts @ 127/n<pos> $SPY $TSLA $AAPL 11 more followers and I‚Äôll have 600, that‚Äôs when the endorsement money starts rolling in fam!/n<neg> Lord knows I‚Äôm a degenerate so I would of probably tripled it cause I would of went balls deep on some $aapl weeklys üòÇ/n<neg> @BullFlexDaily Keep it on the DL but there's this company $AAPL who makes cell phones and now electric cars.  Hearing rumors they might sell fake meat soon too./n<pos> @TSOH_Investing Nice. WFC/Scharf I hope is a winning combo. If you could trade with no tax hit, how different would this look?  BRK is a no brained imo, but I don't know why Buffett doesn't sell more of the AAPL, we'll see if he is right./n<neu> @xDreamCoding @CodingMark @tim_cook @elonmusk @WholeMarsBlog @SawyerMerritt @28delayslater @ConnectingODots And that is why I have 80x more $TSLA than $AAPL/n<neg> $AAPL made almost 3 times as much PROFIT last year as $SBUX had in SALES.

Don‚Äôt give me your toxic bearish thesis. No one cares.

#Seeyoulater/n<pos> So FYI...

I'm long &amp; strong $TWTR, $SHOP, $AAPL for this WAVE 5

Also long $CRM, $DOCU, $FDX, $WYNN...not sure how long

Pretty much blown up my options account learning options in past 2 months, so I have now joined the "I've blown up an account" club!üòé/n<neu> Waiting for that glorious dip from $AAPL before I throw down./n<neu> @B_Funk_ Hmm... I thought MAGA was leading this rally... $msft $aapl $googl $amzn ... ü§î Guess FANG too..../n<pos> @SpacBobby On fire!  Moved into TECL call options and am up 190%, rolling that over into May calls and going heavy on $AAPL calls next week, LFG/n<neu> @mungerian @ThinkingAboutV Yes except i sold $goog. Theyve ran hotter than the rest so while i think they crush like the others not sure if theyll go higher on a beat. $amzn and $aapl highest conviction followed by $fb/n<neu> @JacksonSalzman I‚Äôll typically go out 2-4 months and out of the money.  Example would be selling $135 AAPL calls for $7.  Net $142 or $7 premium gain per share.  I have a $140 target for these shares to exit so doing this juices that at a point where the stock has moved $17 off it‚Äôs lows./n<pos> @DereckCoatney Indeed. I always have aapl open when I‚Äôm trading spx!/n<neu> @EliteOptions2 AAPL! It broke the .618 fib level at 132.68 for me.

Thanks Ed, although I am a little bullish on the little iphone maker $AAPL than you. hah Enjoy the Masters/n<neu> @jbs5 @dhaval_kotecha You can get a free trial if you have an AAPL watch 90 days I trialed it./n<neg> @dhaval_kotecha Totally! That‚Äôs what everyone misses. The experience is very difficult to price with Peloton. I went online and watched an FRX class or MYX whatever the bike is called it‚Äôs very lackluster. Even the AAPL fitness is mundane as well.../n<neu> @zaidror Monster call positions in $amzn, $fb, $goog, $aapl, $snap, $twtr plus everything else i hold stocks and leaps in rebounded. Also got out out close to highs in many names and missed the first half of the drawdown though got hit by 2nd half after getting back in too big and quickly/n<neg> @patrickq007 @OnDaBus6am @garyblack00 Spoken like someone who is convincing themselves not to own the stock.

How about buttons? Did you think like many, that people like buttons? 
$AAPL/n<pos> @BrianVCaffrey Congrats! I rolled $fb up taking 50% of original $ out and sold $goog fri, that ones ran the most. Got a weekly on $amzn in addition to two monthlys and sold it fri for 90% but keeping others full size. Have not touched $aapl at all yet/n<neu> @Crussian17 What‚Äôs your thought on large tech this week? Have some weekly puts on $SNAP and $TWTR that expire this week that haven‚Äôt treated me well. Have some $AAPL calls also hoping for a continued run into earnings./n<pos> $AAPL love what I see here/n<pos> @tomas_coalson I like to add more shares on AApl. what do you think? Thanks/n<neu> @mukund How do I interpret the second chart? AAPL with a 30 PE NTM and the others similar.  It surely doesn‚Äôt have a 10X valuation relative to the SP500?/n<neg> Very close to never running another $FB ad. The adjustments that $AAPL made is crippling their ad platform and it‚Äôs analytics and ad conversions have suffered.

I‚Äôd keep an eye on the stock, I‚Äôm probably not alone in this. 

(Yes, a fundamental take)/n<pos> @Crussian17 Thank you! I‚Äôm long $FNGU and bought some calls on $AAPL/n<pos> @SJosephBurns I have found that my trading system continues to evolve as the environment changes. Being flexible is important I think. It seems to work. One element for success is to overweight in a few stocks with excellent long term prospects. AAPL is one of those./n<pos> @countermass @grassosteve His price target is $180, which I believe is pretty aggressive but even in a sell off $AAPL is a great stock because of passive investing combined with it being seen as a safe haven./n<neu> @PikesPeakTrades Aapl still just above 130 while it was 145 just in a few weeks back. I feel it has bit more juices left to run/n<pos> After you spot money flow in, I like to follow price targets. No, not analysts PTs!! Your own. Create and follow your own PTs. $AAPL once I saw money flow back into it mid March I made some PT going out 2weeks-1month. $AAPL has amazing runs so I wrote down 130-135. Think future!/n<neu> I‚Äôm buying PUTS on all you MFs $SPY $AAPL/n<pos> I'll be working on reducing my number of positions. I've found 30-35 total tickers is my optimal place. My current larger cash position is due to a covered call assignment for $AAPL yesterday./n<pos> @InvestmentTalkk Ok. I will buy more $AAPL on Monday now. üòÇ/n<neu> Holding: $CLOV $RIDE $LAZR $HBRM $WRFX

Market at ATHs with exception of NASDAQ which has been on a run, are we still shaky with the hands or are we buying into the economic uptrend? I‚Äôve been scaling in, looking for a bounce into summer!/n<pos> This may not be a big deal but I put my order in for my first share in $AAPL last night!/n<neu> @ParikPatelCFA you are right lol, it's $AAPL. feel free to correct me anytime lol. We don't all have your level of perfection!/n<pos> @anandchokkavelu I own both. $AAPL is also about 17x as large./n<neu> @Olaedoinvest @Flash_Titans + my way. If it doesn't, I am often out before the stop even hits, purely because a setup failed. Because the best setup triggers work immediately. I use trailing stops on the liquid names like SPY, QQQ, AAPL. Gets me out of puts on vertical capitulation flushes at good +/n<neu> Thread
$GSAT is extremely undervalued right now but there are people who know its true value. The article I am sharing is from 2017. LTE-based 4G spectrum back then was around 2 billion but wait, Now this spectrum is worth way more and is a diamond mine.
$T $QCOM $AAPL $VZ/n<pos> @jpr007 Great thread.
I think people who are buying $AAPL now (not me) are betting on an acceleration of growth (+ margin expansion) because of services.
They basically assign a high LTV on each Apple customer./n<pos> @Atlanta2NYC I agree that seems like a reasonable outcome. If this is the case then I imagine we will see a few massive breakouts coincide with that of $QQQ ‚Äî like $AMZN, $AAPL etc./n<neu> @MileyCyrus @CashApp $ZenSistahüßò

#InvestInYou #15YearsofMiley/n<pos> @hmeisler I still think and even more that apple has good chances to dominate pc market with new shift to own silicon. This could open better potential to $AAPL stock than apple car./n<pos> The #1 SPAC that I am excited to invest in would have to be the #virginhyperloop!

If this is what someone thinks will happen with $SPOT, it's a massively undervalued company./n<neu> @PikesPeakTrades Does the last 3 times this happened was weeks before earnings or after earnings ?  Note that we have earnings in next 3 weeks . Unless a  really bad news I doubt that a AAPL sell off happens./n<neu> @JimScalpert @sanu_kiii @ultimatejingle @Book_of_Job Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want to take any shorts with aapl &gt;132 amzn &gt;3258.

I have 50% in ETFs, 40% in stable stocks (stable meaning established companies with real revenues like MSFT, COST, TGT, AAPL, etc not risky startups) and 10% in high risk high reward like NVAX, SKLZ, PLTR, etc./n<pos> @spectre_trades You killed this!  I joined along and held a little longer than should but still gained 250%  was a great finish to a good week.  Followed you on a few other good trades.  AAPL and FUBO to name a few./n<pos> I put out solid info &amp; DD on Twitter and get +1 follower and maybe someone will subscribe to my substack.

Here are the last 3 dates that happened:
July 31 and Aug. 3, 2020
Oct. 12, 2020
Jan. 25, 2021

The last two dates led to multi-week sell offs.

Steve play on Fast Money was good old trusty $AAPL that‚Äôs def not a good sign for $PSFE. Then again everyone owns it I just hope he‚Äôs right about $180.

I think chances are higher for a pullback/breather after that run. I am hands off for now.

A total of 10 companies I'm watching and really can only buy 1 or 2 but everything will depend on what happens at 9:30 there is so many moving parts right now.

$NLOK/n<pos> @richardbauly I think it‚Äôs coming, not sure when. 

$MSFT has been in talks with both Discord/TikTok so it‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre after a social media. 

$AMZN owns Twitch which is essentially the gaming ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù, Twitter would be a nice pair. 

$AAPL and $TWTR just seem like a perfect match./n<neu> I‚Äôm surprised no company has bought $TWTR yet. It‚Äôs market cap is tiny at 57B and Jack isn‚Äôt in the top 5 equity shareholders any longer so he couldn‚Äôt stop a sale. 

His main focus has clearly become fintech/NFT/crypto aka $SQ. 

$AAPL $AMZN and $MSFT are 3 suitors I could see./n<pos> @7Innovator I would vote for Tesla &amp; Apple. $TSLA. $AAPL. Privacy is an under appreciated long-term advantage and it can meaningfully disrupt multiple markets./n<neu> @LuisGH2020 @TSOH_Investing It's easy today, with massive consumer buying power, high mkt multiples and low interest rates to say, AAPL valuation should be this or that, but  what's the point?   I'll buy stuff other ppl are not interested in that's less liquid, we will see how it plays out./n<neu> @WOLF_Financial @fiducia_invest OK.  I have never gotten an answer on this.  Again using Warren Buffet as an example of "concentration" when Berkshire Hathaway holds positions in over 40 companies.  From $AAPL to $KO to $BAC. That seems like major diversification to me.  Someone please explain.  Thanks./n<neu> @LuisGH2020 @TSOH_Investing Personally, I think there's prob easier money to make than following what Berkshire has to do because of its size.     AAPL is consumer discretionary, what's the mkt going to decide the appropriate multiple is on that, let's see./n<pos> @CryptoMichNL I have invested half of my fiat currency into crypto, the other quarter into stocks like AAPL and CokaCola and the other quarter i am holding onto my bank account.

I also was early in MSFT, AAPL, TSLA - no rocket science.  Anyone that invested in any of his SPACs, has lost bigly.

Seems likely biotech and small growth will have their time in the sun again at some point :)/n<neu> for perspective - $AMZN long call @ 3028 - based off an hourly violation, $AAPL long call w/in 30 cents of bottom? hourly as well
$MSFT 255 call? same thing

For instance, take the AirPods Pro.

Summary so far from this morning (these happen &amp; are part of the game):

- I did not get filled on $AAPL $BABA

Her TSLA/AAPL leaps from December are extremely suspect, but her MSFT options don't appear to have benefitted directly from insider info unless she purchased them between gov't deal and public announcement./n<pos> I like when on two tickers I watch, I get trade signals in opposite direction almost at the same time- chances are that one of them will work - all I need is to manage both trades properly

Don't get me wrong, things are moving.
But you have to ask yourself many game plan questions, including risk reward.

I am keeping an eye on $AAPL.
Waiting for something to set up and will likely target 134.35 as the final exit area.

#AAPL/n<pos> Stocks won't move because you want them to move.  As long as you know the reason why you buy, with patience, you will make a huge bank.  I never lost patience loading the weakness. It's always an opportunity for me.

I‚Äôd be cautious with this stock after the $JNJ vaccine halt. It just didn‚Äôt pull back at all.

There are some large Bearish bets on Apple for this week./n<neu> Traders help! If I have a short call that is getting destroyed by rally, do I buy a call with a higher or lower strike to help save it?
#stocks #TRADINGTIPS $PYPL $AAPL $SQ/n<pos> Good morning! We have a lot of action this far in premarket. Here are a few names I‚Äôll have in my radar going into the opening bell:

$PFE $RIOT $NVDA $BABA $TSLA $AAPL 

#DayTrading #StockMarket @StacTrading/n<pos> $AAPL Expected to release the new iPhone around September/October with a keynote beforehand like they do every year.

all,imo
@FlexOniHub/n<pos> AAPL Average is a Bit High at 132.17~ Only holding 400 shares Currently tho at that average with the Hopes I can average down this morning and Trade out of the Deficit position~ :)
all,imo
@FlexOniHub/n<neg> @wirhabenbread I don‚Äôt play options all the time, but when I do it with $AAPL I wait for the high of day and watch puts, or wait for low of day and watch calls 

For me it‚Äôs easier to scalp only during movement, I hate being in an option when underlying doesn‚Äôt move and the premium gets wrecked/n<neu> $SPX

At the moment, I see head &amp; should patterns in $AAPL, &amp; $IWM.  I'm expecting $SPX to fall back to 4000 by EOM and complete the H&amp;S pattern.

Caveat Emptor./n<neu> @TQQQTRADER Any options on $AAPL? It‚Äôs my dream stock for a cash secured put, but I don‚Äôt have enough capital./n<pos> @darkasaurus @StoopTalkStonks @Chrisjjosephs @litcapital Or I actually sleep vs reading Twitter all night. 

Yes, MSFT is up 10%, so is AMZN. AAPL is up 8% and FB up 15%. Maybe there has been a broader rally in tech stocks that this announcement had little to do with./n<neu> @HammerToe @AllisonReichel @satsie Also, XRP is a ticker for Ripple. If you worked at Apple, and I said you worked at AAPL, that would be correct. No need to be pedantic/n<pos> @GroovyGeek @ThinkingAboutV @nanopore @GrailBio @geochurch That's a good point. Do you think 'first mover' counts for less in liquid biopsy or NGS or related fields? I read one of the many books on the history of $AAPL and Steve Jobs, and my take is that Jobs was great at staying ahead of the curve by setting a vision for the products/n<neu> Just like the trades in $aapl $amzn and $Nvda I will be entering back into $tsla once we get over the 50 day as it‚Äôs cleared the 100 &amp; 200. $715 is our bogey./n<neu> Since today is the day, I‚Äôll say it. Profitability of the financial sector and banks are the least impacted by the inflation spike according to the recent PPI details.

Happily going on 14 years with $AAPL./n<neg> The problem isn't the companies that shift the production/profits overseas, but those that cannot set up subsidiaries,i.e.,Apple can't allocate profits to two subsidiaries in Ireland if the products weren't manufactured there.

$GOOG returned 30% YTD which is fantastic 
$AMZN was very undervalued at 3000 but let‚Äôs see how much it runs 

$AAPL I own but have least expectations for in 21 as is historically expensive when compared to itself others are not/n<neu> @stonkscheer #btc inside $COIN is arrives with a 5% fee?

You are assuming that people have money forever and are investing all in TSLA and AAPL etc. This makes no sense. You're just trying to push your narrative.

I guess if Zwift was public I would buy Zwift instead of my $PTON but I now understand the value of it. Its like ‚ÄûFitness-AAPL‚Äú with a monthly subscription./n<neg> @stocktalkweekly What I learned in this market: when a sector is most euphoric = the best time to sell. When a sector is most depressing = the best time to buy. After huge $COIN IPO, watch for a selloff of #BTC $ETH $TSLA and large caps $FB $AAPL $NFLX $GOOG $AMZN $MSFT. SPAC are depressing today/n<neg> @vladtenev your product has a major defect:  trust. not only am i ok with paying commissions, i will never need to worry about your deceitful and blatant lies.  trust is everything.  why was it safe to buy msft or aapl or even tsla but not gme or slv?  i do not trust you .../n<neg> old school traders say ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know the full position‚Äú

So you‚Äôre telling me you think it‚Äôs more valuable than $AAPL or $MSFT? Also, why not take that $350+ and buy actual #cryptocurrencies with the same projections but own an actual asset? Someone please explain./n<pos> I have whittled smart speaker/assistant down to $AAPL vs. $GOOGL.

The bull case for me to go $AAPL is everything I own is Apple. I would like some HomePod owners to give their reviews on performance?

If they think they have a solution which can compete with the AAPL watch, I‚Äôm inclined to believe them./n<neu> I agree with the author Robert Greene who said ‚Äúa strategist never competes strength against strength. Instead they probe the enemy‚Äôs weakness.‚Äù

MSFT stock was auto-exercised options purchased February 28, 2020 that expired March 19, 2021.

That was just a good play, but the TSLA moves are textbook insider trading./n<pos> 9 Trillion of market cap is in 6 stocks in that order: AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, FB and TSLA. TSLA is up 396% over 12 months and here they are listed by risk of a large correction TSLA, AAPL, GOOGL, FB, MSFT and AMZN. Makes sense since AMZN and MSFT have better reasons to be up./n<neu> As soon as AAPL hits 135 the theory behind our play is that it will keep moving in the direction we want. However, if it doesn‚Äôt, we need to get out of the play immediately. I use a VERY tight SL. The idea behind this is we can always buy back into the same BO level/n<neu> Does this always work? No, the most important part of the entire strategy is to NOT hold losers and hoping for a miracle. For example, I give AAPL a BO (breakout) level of 135./n<neu> @LGJet1 @EeShmee @stringerbell99 @data168 I‚Äôm into trading for a profit. If im trading AMZN, AAPL, GME, or DOGE. To me as a trader, I‚Äôm in and out quick with profits. MANY people said the same about GME yet its still trading in the $150s. I‚Äôm not betting my ROTH IRA in doge. But if there is money to be made, make it./n<neg> @Ryzan55 Trade charts, draw a plan, stop thinking

tsla, bnb, aapl, msft I could care less I trade their charts/n<neu> @sajidnizami @Mephisto731 I‚Äôd argue liquidity provision and short vol both stem from the leverage. 

Your AAPL trade experiences more drag if volatility increases and compounds faster when vol falls.

The expansion of carry increases liquidity and vice versa - seems true but maybe unimportant./n<neu> @coloradotravis I know, took AAPL 44 years to get to $1T and 1 extra year to get to $2T with a net income less than in 2018ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. We‚Äôve entered the era of exponential...But I have a feeling you are not talking about AAPL - the biggest cash cow out there.../n<pos> @finance_hipster @DivCultivator If I wanted total return I would buy more growth companies like $AMZN, $DIS, $AAPl - some pay a dividend but most reinvest back into the company to grow (no guarantee tho)

I have a dividend portfolio too but those companies are more mature - less growth (there are exceptions)/n<pos> @mikeybitcoin I own $AAPL &amp; would want you to stay. But I can see the company has lost imagination.  You're better off in crypto! Good luck. KeepSmiling üòäüå∫/n<pos> 1 of most interesting points made by $BTC bulls is market cap (1 trill) v. gold (10 trill).  Strong case to surpass gold mc and I believe logic can also be applied to tech co valuations near term.

Now $AAPl is approaching ATHs again and the small stuff is down 30% from when I bought!/n<neu> @WentzTime @crypto_rand I meant to say cash covered put. 

Say $aapl is 134. You sell put for 135 for 30 days. You put up collateral and collect $300 premium.

AAPl for instance would we day it‚Äôs at a fair market price? Not in the least in my opinion./n<neg> @ArkadiuszKula @GerberKawasaki I hate the idea of NFT.  It's highway robbery.

Started the day by closing my $TSLA swing and cashing in on puts to pay for the loss, I'm now back in calls overnight.

Closed $INTC &amp; $UPST puts swings for wins, although closed early. Sold $AAPL at breakeven.

I will remain a proud shareholder, with an outsized amount, and my largest position in AAPL, because you are a world-class CEO that drives the best company in the world with passion, vision, and integrity. So proud of your approach, and desire to lead by example./n<neu> @ThetaWarrior I was saying in the Discord I think AAPL pulls back for a few days before breaking through/n<pos> @TheAlphaThought @Califas_jose92 Quick question: I‚Äôm a beginner, and I‚Äôve started my dividend portfolio with AAPL, JNJ, MMM, MSFT, PG, SBUX, and T.  All of them dripping, hopefully for a long, long time.  Any Real Estate dividend stocks you can point me toward?/n<neu> 420 #DOGE: I hope the irony is not lost on the $DOGE buyers (hopefully, all crypto "investors").

I don‚Äôt believe this is a reflection on broader #Tech earnings.
#AAPL #FB/n<pos> @lexamillly I need these!!!!  And so does my 135 AAPL 3/2023./n<neu> @InvestmentTalkk I think $PTON is more about the subscription quality than the hardware.
Same reason why $AAPL releasing a new Apple TV doesn't affect $ROKU/n<neg> God damn.  What a good-ass day.  It's #four20, new $AAPL products announced, and Derek Chauvin is guilty.  I don't even care how badly my portfolio fucked me today.  No amount of money can take this joy away from me. #ChauvinIsGuilty/n<neg> @ShaolinvsWutang @DanYunIsTrying True, I‚Äôm just having ptsd from the comments section of hasbro‚Äôs AAPL post/n<pos> @fiducia_invest @InvestmentTalkk A company called Tile has been making this product for almost a decade now. Raised about $100M.

Pretty cool concept, I wonder if $AAPL entering their field helps their business or destroys them./n<pos> @arunNYC I mean I saw the update yesterday (?) that it's allowed back in the Apple store $aapl üñ§/n<neu> 7 days left to earning call, I think $AAPL made a killing. Let‚Äôs see./n<pos> @lazrpng @87AlwaysRed Big difference here: you‚Äôre talking about ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù stocks. I agree with you on ZM &amp; NFLX I‚Äôve been short ZM 3 quarters ago and made a ton of money. I‚Äôm short NFLX as well especially with DIS + &amp; their higher prices. But AAPL &amp; MSFT are different and will continue to grow./n<neu> Going into today:
$AAPL close below PP, rejection at R1 with a bearish engulfing ‚ùå
$TSLA NH compared to yesterday. Crossed PP but no hold ‚úÖ
$BA I‚Äôm stopped out. Broke through and held S2 ‚úÖ‚ùå
$PLTR rejected at 0.62 fib, rejected before S1 but comparatively a higher low ‚ùå/n<pos> @lazrpng @87AlwaysRed We have big tech earnings report next week. I doubt MSFT &amp; AAPL will disappoint/n<neu> @MarketRebels The number of AAPL call options traded on announcement week just tell me how newbies are buying those. There is little to no chance the stock goes high after the product reveals. Unlike leading to the event which was the buy and sell opportunity from previous weeks./n<neg> I‚Äôm already at 75% TSLA in my stock portfolio. Should I just get rid of my remaining AAPL, AMZN, NFLX and go 100% TSLA? Why half-ass this thing./n<pos> $AAPL after many plump at ER, I‚Äôm more confident Appl will rocket at ER/n<neu> @InvestmentTalkk @FradeDuarte I don‚Äôt hold any of these two and I haven‚Äôt done proper due diligence on any of them but surely the ability of $AAPL to integrate their hypothetical fitness products with their other products (iWatch, iPhone, iPad...) would be just ü§Ø/n<neg> Did Apple wow anyone? 

I‚Äôm not impressed at all. 

$aapl/n<neu> @InvestmentTalkk Disclosure: I own $AAPL and $PTON/n<neu> @InvestmentTalkk Not really honestly. I‚Äôm not saying they wouldn‚Äôt have costumers, they might have great success actually, but that doesn‚Äôt affect $PTON trajectory. $PTON is a real fitness/Sports brand, $AAPL isn‚Äôt. $AMZN can also sell luxury but will never be a $FTCH. Brand perception matters./n<neu> $AAPL at the tip of a W chart pattern. Confirm and let me know./n<neu> @InvestmentTalkk I think they would be if $aapl gave free subscriptions with hardware/n<pos> @RevShark The market will turn around. I sold $AAPL , $SBUX, $MSFT AND $GOOG earlier today and bought $XOM  and 10% more $XERS . I‚Äôll buy those names I sold once $XOM rebounds. Big dividend and earning coming./n<pos> @InvestmentTalkk I think if it‚Äôs under 40 billion dollars it‚Äôs a good deal for aapl long term expanding in to the fitness market think about their software on the PTON bikes, extra features potential add ons they can charge. Plus the brand potential of PTON is already so strong/n<pos> @namle151 Thanks my guy. I checked call to put ratio as well, lot on aapl amzn and googl. I‚Äôll take some lottos on those as well üëçüèª/n<neg> @InvestmentTalkk Apple fitness hasn't been showing signs of big success. Although to be fair, i'm not sure $AAPL was even trying to surpass $PTON with this move. Maybe it's just another feature for their subscriptions &amp; services growth &amp; ecosystem./n<pos> @tim_cook I need you to do more Tim Apple. $AAPL needs üìà so my portfolio sees some green again/n<neu> @MaxJacobsEdison I'm wondering to see if $AAPL gets into this game/n<neu> I went into each of their ir website : Tsla 4/26, msft 4/27, aapl 4/28, Goog 4/27 , Amzn 4/29 , fb 4/28/n<pos> That iPad Pro is calling out to me....now what to do with it...and who gets my current iPad? Mom? Dad? Grandma? I have too many AAPL products, but they keep coming out with cooler stuff!  Damnit!!!!!!!/n<pos> I‚Äôm very bullish $AAPL after the announcements today!/n<pos> @TheMarkCooke I get excited when I see green. Feels like a special bonus.

Or it‚Äôs finally the perfect use case for the included sticker üòÅ./n<pos> It's good time to be an $aapl investor, the M1 chip is fantastic, I have no doubt the new M1 line of products will sell better than the lackluster releases over the past few years./n<pos> The #AppleEvent was good, nothing üòú. Biggest takeaway is the continued integration of $AAPL M1 chip in iMac üñ• &amp; iPad Pro üîú margin expansion. Liked what I saw w/ @AppleTV (connectivity to home health, streaming, other subs). AirTags will low key kill it. @ApplePodcasts also üëçüèª/n<pos> I am super excited about the $AAPL Airtags.  I know, not a groundbreaking new tech or product but the utility of these things are endless.  Not just keys and wallet, slip one into the kids pocket, backpack, dog leash, bike‚Ä¶I will have at least 10 of them./n<pos> Like this article on $AAPL. Most important piece of information is the comment on in-house chips. These chip shortages, IMO, are going to drive more companies to build in-house. To me, this gives Apple an edge. I believe this trend will grow. Especially with custom AI products./n<pos> @Apple Some of the applications for #LiDar are making me want to come back to #iPhone as an Android lover, but not until iOS enables split screen and that big notch gets diminished or possibly eliminated all together.

I for one am very bullish on the Apple Watch and it‚Äôs ability to grow a mobile/wearable/monitoring healthcare economy.

This is in the wheelhouse of Apple but they can‚Äôt forget developers. They transformed the value of the iPhone.

$AAPL is interesting too. They have such a large built in advantage (iPhone/app store), but aren't really dominating any of the markets you talked on.

$AAPL/n<neu> 26th April '21
2/3 - small green day
$AAPL C135 -2,2%
$SPY P418 +14,4%
$TSLA P730 +10,6%
total +$2,2k

My plan for the nearest future is to trade the same way as I always do and wait patiently for stars to align to have a BIG trade, until then small numbers will do.
#Options/n<pos> Call me crazy but I'm feeling even more bullish across all portfolios today. How are you feeling? 

A few of my favorites right now.  $VUZI ü§ù $BNT ü§ù $LINK ü§ù $AAPL ü§ù $CRWD ü§ù $AAVE/n<neu> @stocktalkweekly @LucidMotors It Will be $fsr and $aapl (I think)./n<pos> @simonembanna Ah I know that feeling. Good thing is there's always a new asset that will eclipse the previous. People that missed out on BRK probably made it up in AAPL. People that missed out on AAPL probably made it up in AMZN. And so on. Zion and Lamelo are coming. And then there's Bronny/n<pos> $CCIV - I‚Äôm holding long Jan 2021 &amp; Jan 2022 $30 &amp; $40 calls respectively!!

$AAPL - IF ONLY the rumor with Apple is true then this will see new ATH/n<pos> @igettrades247 i love $aapl but i dont own the stock directly. instead a bought $brk.b which owns about 5% of the company as well as many others./n<neg> @CryptoKaleo I cant see aapl in bsc ?/n<neg> @WallStreetRy @LucidMotors Then again can't get hold of $AAPL because its 'price is NOT rising due to this particular rumour'?. So it has to be @LucidMotors . But as you pointed out, technically it's not public yet. Seems to me we are in the dark till something official is announced./n<pos> @chamath Markets have been amazing for me! Forever holds $AAPL $AMZN $FB $MSFT $NVDA $SBUX $DIS $PYPL
Many great shorts out there as well. Easy to see, happy to play. Thank you/n<pos> I love when $FB and $AAPL publicly feud. Apple is a far superior company.

#stock #StocksToWatch #Options/n<neu> @stocktalkweekly @LucidMotors I really hope AAPL can come in regarding software to help CCIV with autonomous driving. However, I just searched on LinkedIn and none of the employees I clicked follows AAPL... Most of them do follow GM, Ford, Tesla, Amazon, etc.... This is either hiding very well, or nada.../n<pos> @StockOptionCole Looks like a great set up but that‚Äôs my whole bankroll! Lol. In $KGC, $PLTR, $BNGO, and $AAPL for the week. I think $AAPL can hit $140...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§î/n<pos> When $LAZR partner with $TSLA I knew there then that $MVIS is gonna go up. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if $AAPL announced partnership with $MVIS for its lidar sensor technology. Definitely keep stock a watch./n<neg> If @LucidMotors comes out and says the $AAPL and $CCIV rumor was just that, a rumor... I think it'll set the stock back worse that the DA confusion. 

I'm in for the long, so F it... Just don't want people to freak./n<neu> we had the same gut feeling when CCIV and lucid was a rumor. I do think $LCID will partner with $AAPL/n<neu> 3/3 and $AAPL, not $CCIV and $AAPL - technically, since the reverse merger of @LucidMotors and $CCIV hasn't closed yet, Lucid is not yet  publicly - so do they fall under NYSE regs?

It very well may be true &amp; I hope it is - opening it up for discussion - legal minds pls opine!/n<neu> 2/3 I'm genuinely *not sure* if that applies here for two reasons:

1. $AAPL doesn't trade on the NYSE, they trade on the Nas - I *don't know* if this applies to the Nasdaq

2. Now you might say, but $CCIV trades on the NYSE, which is true, however, the rumor is w/ *Lucid*.../n<pos> @Wearejustvibes @stocktalkweekly @LucidMotors Possibility of $FSR too which I own but I think $CCIC / Lucid is the perfect fit as the most elite EV to come to the market and we all know $AAPL wants to have the Best so to me everything points to &gt;&gt; $CCIV / LUCID/n<pos> I traded $AAPL $TSLA today. Luckily on $TSLA, I was able to sell at the top $749. $AAPL the break of 9 EMA on 1mn chart at 9:57 was my entry, riding it up to my profit target of $134.67. Having an edge on Monday is always nice. Insane ER plays ahead./n<pos> @stocktalkweekly @LucidMotors $CCIV...I've had a gut feeling from early on they would have some type of partnership with $AAPL and take on $TSLA....have that feeling stronger then ever lately, we shall see...either way $CCIV / Lucid I see as gonna be a real Game changer..imo/n<neg> @DougApte Jony Ive "news" is about 100 years old.  Today's news is about Rawlinson's refusing to answer a question about $AAPL (which was known last week).  This pop is dumb, but I'll take it./n<pos> $CCIV solid +10% on a scalp.  If $AAPL rumor gains more traction, I might consider a re-buy/n<neu> $CCIV x $AAPL won‚Äôt happen IMO. Apple made their intentions clear that they want to develop their own car. What do they gain from Lucid? 

I‚Äôm bullish both companies./n<neg> Whos been selling these aapl 135 calls ? 3weeks now &amp; shit can't get above 135. They know something i dont know? @jimcramer  @jonnajarian @MarketRebels/n<neu> @InfinityTradesX 4% doesn't seem like much. Anyone know what $AAPL has been recently? I don't play ER, but if I did, selling premium seems like the best way to play them. But 4% seems light to me./n<pos> We Crushed $AMD live today! hope everyone made some good money.  I got filled on $AAPL positions as well.  The bottom side of the IF and IC on $TSLA are looking really nice from last week./n<neu> $CCIV is getting some love ‚ù§Ô∏è on rumor $aapl will get the shaft today through Wednesday most likely then it‚Äôs all ER dependent. No bull no bear till I read report. I would be a fool not to trade both directions till then./n<neu> Do I think $CCIV x $AAPL will happen? Who knows.

What I do know is, the last time Peter Rawlinson denied something in an interview, it was the @LucidMotors x $CCIV merger rumors. The skeptics mocked the speculation as a joke at that time. 

You know the rest of the story./n<neu> $AAPL &amp; $CCIV partnership?üò≥

Good luck friends./n<pos> @jimish @WallStChameleon Thanks for the reply. It is a contrarian take and I still like $AAPL.

Keep in mind I called out Music, Apple+, Fitness, and Card.

These likely contribute little to Services bottom line. Also, they are highly competitive and lower margin./n<neu> @eToro 6 of my 17 companies report this week: $V, $GOOG, $AAPL, $FB, $MA &amp; $DPZ.

Paying over a dollar to make 5 is not very good. The SPY is good because many sector rotations can keep it bullish.

Although I still have concerns, I‚Äôm gaining confidence./n<neu> Disclosure: I own shares of $FB, $AAPL and $GOOG/n<neu> The exact reason I had today as a low and started leaning towards it not being the beginning of W-5 is because of this. $AAPL and $FB soaring.

Should I purchase some more #SAFEMOON while I'm at it?/n<pos> Apple $AAPL is clearly one where you think it cannot be bigger, it proves you wrong time after time, that it can still be bigger and even better. Kudos. Holding on, until the numbers tell me otherwise. 

[Writing this on iPad, calculating the numbers on my iPhone]/n<neu> @eldaminato Superb on both. I am only holding $FB through earnings. I did not trade $AAPL/n<pos> @tpsojda Nice div increase!

I don‚Äôt own $AAPL for the div/div growth

I can‚Äôt believe AAPL and FB are not at the top of every value investors list üìà/n<neu> @Pluggage_ Blasphemous! Thats what i mean. i feel like evryone wins when $AAPL wins üôå/n<pos> @lonemapleleaf @coffeencrypt0 I think I purchased all mine in college, so not that deep into it.

Man‚Ä¶. Must‚Äôve been a great past few years to get a job offer at $AAPL with stock growth though‚Ä¶/n<pos> @great_martis Blowout compared to expectations, perhaps?

Either way, I‚Äôm stoked. Accounts I manage own a whole lot of $AAPL/n<neu> @iriteshsonavane And their small firm competitors will have to waste $ flying blind on ad spend.

Zuck said the $AAPL update could encourage sellers to use FB since they'll be less able to microtarget elsewhere &amp; I think that could be right./n<neu> @coffeencrypt0 $AKAM or $AAPL I only own stock in two companies outside of index funds vast majority is in index funds/n<neu> So the next stock I‚Äôm away to purchase is $AAPL, even before their earnings I would have suggested they‚Äôre a strong buy but their earnings today reassure that. Their price on the stock market is massively undervalued right now $133.58 at close, $136.69 now

#MeerkatStocks #Stocks/n<pos> @OptionsIdeas I did yesterday on the long side ah. down a bit today as I loaded up long at 84.6. wish I would have shorted the top, just couldnt do it.. see how it plays out.

I don't know anyone who's bought an $AAPL product lately but quarter after quarter they seem to sell an iPhone, Mac, iPad, etc to every person on Earth.  Just seems too good to be true, strikes me as odd./n<neg> @realRajatDey @jimcramer The sheer scale of $AAPL makes it harder to move. Facebook is about a third of the size./n<pos> I am super IMPRESSED by $AAPL's earnings. They're back to high growth mode (+53.7% Y/Y)
#Applefangirl for life!/n<pos> Those $AAPL numbers make me want to buy more. 

Do you own $AAPL?/n<pos> @jimcramer $AAPL was the first stock I ever bought when I started doing my own investments (5-6 years ago) Never looked back./n<pos> A tiny company called Apple just reported 54% year-over-year revenue growth. I 'm officially declaring Apple to be the new small cap stock. üòâüòâ $AAPL/n<neu> @munster_gene Tesla vs AAPL next 5-10 years ? Not even close. No way i‚Äôm putting 1 penny in Apple./n<pos> It only took 3 years (and a ton of burned money buying options), but I finally opened a large $AAPL position when it backtested the 200D in March around $119.

Proud of me. I now have a level to add more at or average up (if/when necessary)./n<neu> @TraderXenomorph When‚Äôs the last time aapl blew up on earnings? How‚Äôs never sound, but I‚Äôm up 2800% on my shares. Hold hold &amp; hold./n<neu> @StockMarketNerd With the exception of Nadella,

$AAPL
$NFLX

TBD./n<pos> @CAVandy @bluff_capital Idk.. everyone only has 2 ears and $AAPL seems to have them coveredüòÇ.  If it was prepping for a refresh, would the warehouses be full?

If it his $125 I‚Äôm going to buy 10 more shares....

If it hits $140 I will also buy 10 more shares 

üòÇ/n<neu> According to @RobinhoodSnacks ,

‚ÄúAdvertisers targeting iPhone users will get more detailed and timely data if they buy Apple‚Äôs ad space, than if they buy via third parties (like FB).‚Äù

I guess this means long $AAPL and (maybe) avoid $FB./n<neg> I expect $FB to exceed today as a continuation of stay-home effect from pandemic. A huge number of their users have no clue or don‚Äôt care about how their personal data get used. $AAPL should also exceed, the question is how high the expectations are./n<neg> Might yolo some $aapl calls just because I lost so much on their last earnings when they had record highs but stock tanked :D/n<pos> I would like to see $aapl reclaim 145.

I also think it scandalous that Fed smashed bond yield of trillion $ companies that already had heaps of savings and didn't need to raise more capital

I'm targeting $BTC.X $BTC @ ~30k./n<pos> $AMZN $GOOGL $FB $AAPL earnings have been nothing short of absolutely incredible and mind blowing, props although most of this is baked in imo however I love progress and expansion/n<neu> @10trillionBTC O yeah I‚Äôm well aware of that, ask Tesla and aapl how it worked out annnouncing a split, it makes it go higher anyway/n<pos> Amazed at the earnings reports from $AAPL, $FB, $AMZN, $MSFT and $GOOG. 

$FB surprised me the most with their ridiculous margin increase and over 40% growth. $GOOG was a close second because of the jaw-dropping Youtube numbers. 

Anyone else have a fav?/n<neg> Probably the same for everyone on here, I use $TWTR more than any other product in the world, apart from maybe my $aapl iphone or mac to use $twtr. Yet they just always fail at earnings. Its hilarious./n<neu> 03:59:00 PM MINR Automated Entry.  Long 188 shares of $AAPL at 133.33 for a trade that I will be looking to close in the next 10 days./n<pos> Elon said $TSLA has &gt; 0% chances to become most valuable co on Earth.

#stocks #video/n<pos> $AMZN well these tech companies have been smashing these estimates. $GOOG,$AAPL, I mean WOW!!/n<neu> @asymco @Rashomon2 @cubbie9000 I didnt start investing in $AAPL in '07 for shortterm (3-5 year) targets. I knew they were doing things differently &amp; would have long term advantage. 
Same reason I invested in $TSLA in '13. SpaceX in '20
Focusing on shortterm targets/dates is a disservice to your followers./n<neu> @KMaharathy @MathsDegree @RedDogT3 But AAPL doesn't continuously sell new shares.  That would dilute the value of them. If I buy a share of AAPL today, it's almost certainly not the case that I'm buying it from the company itself, but from some other investor./n<neg> @yatesinvesting 5/1 tops split. Still too expensive for retailers. Let the tutes buy this. I‚Äôll buy $AAPL a bigger cash cow!/n<neu> @garyblack00 What about when you add in Risk as part of the context. For example, $FB should have lower multiple compared to $aapl when factoring risk. I'd imagine most view $tsla as highest risk of the bunch. Thanks for all the hard work and sharing Gary!/n<pos> @atxmachine I hope to hold many in my 8-80 ...$zm $mcd $pton $nke $amzn $aapl $goog $shop etc that I have share dhere for years already/n<neu> Still holding my positions even though I considered closing out $AAPL calls for a moment./n<pos> $AAPL calls did a decent job today, did not play anything else since I wasn't at my desk. Still holding $QS calls for next week and two $RKT call lottos expiring tomorrow/n<pos> @GreenTreeRd1 Sold my SPY's for 50% today, locked the gains, bought some AAPL 135's June 4's am I crazy? Your SPY call just bought me 5 years more membership to your page. April has been my best month./n<neu> @andrescardenal At the moment it seems the stock movements are panic driven and highly detached from business performance. I still think in times like these it‚Äôs better to hold on to solid rocks like $AAPL
1/2/n<neu> @HeroDividend Only $aapl I own is the stock/n<pos> @MarketRebels @rocobasilisk TBH, if $AAPL didn‚Äôt pay dividends, I would just trade in and out. But because of dividends, I treat $AAPL like my savings account. I park my cash in $AAPL stocks and buy $TSLA shares when it goes on sale. Hopefully, @elonmusk will one day offer dividends for Tesla stocks./n<neg> @spiderpete1 Yeah I‚Äôm confused. I‚Äôm a LT $aapl investor and don‚Äôt plan on selling any shares. But this short term action is disappointing./n<neg> I might be wrong, but I think $NIO will drop just like $F did. $F beat earnings but they provided terrible guidance due to global semiconductor chip shortage. So what makes $NIO so special that they can avoid this? Do they make their own chips?

$spy $TSLA $BA $AAPL $MSFT $AMZN/n<neu> @OakenshieldVGX @investvoyager It‚Äôs like this. When $VGX goes up in price and I can sell interest for a shit ton, some of that interest will go into traditional stocks. So, $VYGVF and $AAPL, and $DIS, etc./n<neg> It's important to note the continued rejection of good / great reports with ++ guidance. Today &amp; in the last 10 days we have DOW, WHR, LRCX, MSFT, AMD, AGCO, CAT, TMO and likely others I missed. AAPL also with a big gap up - reversal and now in the yawn category .BIG yellow flags/n<neu> Looking to carry my $AMZN, $SPY, and $AAPL plays into tomorrow. Definitely didn't get in where I should have on $AMZN and knew it would drop before end of day. Should have been patient. Will pay off at market open tomorrow./n<pos> $GVSI $RETC $IGPK $WRIT I like them all... starter positions and waiting for pullbacks to load more, I think most will give chances for more loading.

I‚Äôm jamming out to #AAPL‚Äôs quarterly earnings call via podcast right now/n<neg> I guess the $aapl buyback algo isn't going to sell the close üôÑ/n<neu> Wonder if #NFLDraft2021 breaking ratings record, does $DKNG get a nice pop tmrw

I‚Äôll nibble on some $58 calls for tmrw at $45 each

$SPY $TSLA $AAPL $FB $CLOV $AMZN/n<pos> Cash gang. I‚Äôm not playing $AMZN too expensive and I‚Äôd like to keep my $AAPL profits. Made back my losses from $NFLX ER and $TSLA ER. 

Good luck to those who will be playing $AMZN earnings. If they do announce a stock split, I can make money scalping the next day./n<pos> @Tyler_TD I look to add shares under $10 at this point usually and consider selling any nice massive runs up. Missed this morning though as I had a big Apple $AAPL buy yesterday before earnings making it my largest individual stock again. I‚Äôll be looking to buy if it heads back under $10./n<pos> $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT will never disappoint you great cash parks two have nice dividends. Any dips I buy./n<neu> $AAPL if it close over 136. I will hold it to next week/n<neg> $AAPL going negative on the day was a sure sign of a market meltdown for me.  Time to back up and objectively comprehend price action.  I left my shoes some where around 12pm./n<pos> Glad I made a little change on $AAPL calls. I wanted $TSLA right as it was going to $672. I was typing my order for the calls with a $7.88 ask. Before I could submit it bounced to $9.60 in the blink of an eye. Its over $12 now... FML/n<pos> @OptionsMike That‚Äôs what I need for the day like today. $aapl/n<pos> $AAPL bullish activity appears in the options market today - catch me on Bloomberg TV discussing that and more options with @TheChartress at 3:15pm ET today/n<neu> $AAPL making another attempt at breaking above $135-$136 If it fails here I will sell higher priced calls./n<neu> At some point $AAPL gets close to 1/2 trillion of revenue, i have to believe there's just not enough dollars drive more growth...i dont know if i'd pay 25-26x for something like that. My guess is they have to get into new businesses in a big way in the next 1-2 years./n<neg> @JerryFederline I'm not short anything in this market, and you may be right. But earnings has been terrible so far for tech flyers. $NFLX, $TDOC, $TSLA, $PINS all tanked. $AAPL barely moved. $FB and $GOOG strong. Who knows. It is Russian roulette this quarter, but maybe it works out./n<pos> @jimish @7Innovator @TimBain_NC Healthcare is super complex so I could see a large acquisition being reasonable here. I think AAPL would be really good at bringing telehealth to the masses - not sure if it‚Äôs worth the headache. In some form or fashion AAPL will increase their health care/monitoring prevalence/n<neu> @StockTalk416 $MSFT and $AAPL are worth the same PE as $GE and $XOM. 

Makes sense to me./n<neu> I don't think ANYONE in this market would be surprised if the $SPY finished at highs today. We need to know our levels, have a plan and be smart. AVOID FOMO. Hopefully you had the time to watch our midday show. covering our thoughts

$SPY $QQQ $IWM $TNX $AAPL $TSLA/n<neu> @jimcramer $F? Well we shall see about that! $AAPL $2.3 Trillion MCAP? For it to double $5 Trillion? Oh boy! $NOK MCAP is $25 Billion? Even if it quadruples it will only be $100 Billion. Hello, can you hear me? Now? Now? Short Squeeze is brewing... $BTC $24K $TSLA $465! $GME..../n<pos> @burnmash5 @jimcramer If exec bonuses are tied to stock price performance and you're a shareholder, you still win.  I think I'll trust Tim Cook and $aapl with my money over @burnmash5 ... They have a decent history./n<neu> @mikepsilva What are you thinking on those Qs. Is it any kind of sign that $AAPL $MSFT $FB $GOOGL and $TSLA all reported blowout earnings beats this week and it hasn't budged? At this point I'm halfway expecting $AMZN to report $7 billion Q1 earnings and $QQQ to drop 40%./n<pos> When people ask, should I buy AAPL, I always say Yes. There‚Äôs really no way to go wrong. 

But the other side of that coin, and one that may prove far more profitable in % terms, is LYG. I think this is going 5-10X in next 5-7 years/n<pos> @JRogrow Nice perspective John!
Like you, Long all 4 of these Cash is King / Optionality companies.
$AAPL, $FB &amp; $GOOG are Top 10 positions for me.
Seems ‚ÄúFANG‚Äù stocks are making a bit of popularity comeback (Hmmm, maybe I should wait until after $AMZN Earnings this afternoon to say that)/n<neu> @jimcramer Aapl ? mmm no thanks I will buy $SHIB INU/n<neu> @swoph You had me at 1980 $AAPL/n<neg> I hate these retail shake out days.

I like my old iMac but not the browser./n<neu> @ParrotStock @7Innovator Although I also think AAPL would be more interested in something like LVGO was rather than jumping into the deep end with TDOC/n<neu> Bought $AAPL today. Finally gave in. Thought for the longest time the growth story was slowing down but it‚Äôs clearly not over. I was definitely wrong about this one for the past year./n<neu> @7Innovator @TimBain_NC Do you really think getting into healthcare is a smart move or it‚Äôs just what you want to see? *I wouldn‚Äôt hate AAPL eating my TDOC shares*/n<pos> @Matt_Cochrane7 $AAPL, $AMZN &amp; $GOOG for me all winners and would add to all three going forward./n<pos> @7Innovator Always good to see a different view, and regardless of the rest of the business, I agree healthcare would be a smart move for $AAPL 

They are already embedded into all the right places. Just need that linchpin to pull it all together./n<neu> @Matt_Cochrane7 $AMZN $MSFT and $AAPL for me/n<pos> IMHO, I think Apple's $AAPL "all-in" move needs to be in health care. 

This is where Apple's privacy &amp; awesome consumer-facing UI really matters.

Go big or go home. And it needs to move quickly, to get that important step ahead of Google $GOOGL.

Winner will take most./n<pos> @jimcramer For sure if you don't own it yet, best company in the world hands down. I've owned $AAPL since 2014.  Pick up some $TSLA also./n<neu> Out of the FAAMG stocks - $FB, $AMZN, $AAPL, $MSFT, $GOOG - how many do you directly own (not through indexing)? 

I'm long 4 out of 5./n<neu> @jimcramer I own AAPL and sell far out of the money covered calls./n<pos> @hnrtrading This exchange literally had a net positive p&amp;l impact for me over 10k.  I was going to chase the inevitable blow off top. Instead a waited and nibbled on some SPY, TSLA and AAPL puts.  Wow. Best $129 monthly subscription value ever!/n<neu> @thisisdamola warned me about AAPL/n<pos> @MilMileBattery I thought aapl had the best report/n<pos> Friday eve is in full effect! It was a super Green Day! ü§ëü§ëüôåüèøü§ëü§ë I had $AAPL 130p and my money maker... $TSLA 670p. Tesla was so freaking sexy today. I really enjoyed her. We actually had chemistry today üòç because she ‚Äúbe tripping‚Äù sometime. I‚Äôm done for the week. #StayGreen/n<neu> I‚Äôll be adding to $AAPL this week on weakness. Looking for it to rip next week+/n<neu> @InvestmentTalkk Just to put things into perspective.

At $2.26T market cap $PTON makes up 1.3% of apples total cap.

$PTON s revenue wouldn‚Äôt be much more than a drop on a hot stove with 1% of $AAPL s revenue.

Apples revenue growth is 9% which is one $PTON a year./n<pos> I think we may have hit peak $AAPL/n<pos> @andrescardenal from my POV the business case is still attractive . $aapl will become a fifty% service company in the future. for me is HODL. market is maniac depressive in the short term/n<pos> $aapl flattish on a great Q. I was short 140‚Äôs against my long so I‚Äôm okay with this. $pins got hit - holding that through./n<pos> @Zack67654417 Oh no, got in AAPL at $122 still good, but hard to figure! Should go back up before I dump. This chip shortage has gotten interesting, watching AMD?/n<neu> @ReggieMiddleton Love ya Reggie, smart fellow and hope you will do something big in this space. But regarding Apple, didn't you say in 2017 you felt Apple would ultimately fail with their platform and stock? I could be wrong but feel I heard a negative statement about AAPL./n<neu> I have owned $AAPL for a long time, I sold this year to focus on smaller stocks with bigger potential. But seeing the stock down on that massive earnings beat is making me think about buying again. Am I missing something?/n<neu> So i guess the market is telling us it values $FB earnings over $AAPL???/n<neu> @jonnajarian  what call strikes are you selling against $AAPL?

I was thinking $150 Jun?/n<neu> @jimcramer May/June are typically pullback months because traders take time off like teachers do and take profit in May before the slowdown in June. This is normal. I've been in AAPL./n<neg> @SullyCNBC, I have not heard any @CNBC colleague even mention tomorrow's massive futures expirations.  $AAPL isn't down on disappointment. It's down on #marketstructure. The #FAANGs only now bottomed. Suggests #Passives lift them next week post futures./n<neg> $AAPL down after that quarter is mind boggling! I understand they are not cheap, but damn! That was an INSANE quarter üçé/n<neg> @BrianSozzi For the umpteenth time, why does Rod Hall still have a job? 

I do remember last time after Rod Hall gave up on his bearish call, AAPL dropped big afterwards.  He reversed his mea culpa and said he was right all along. What a POS. 

Let see if he is going to rewrite history again/n<neu> @garyblack00 Forbid, but how do you think the stock would react if something happened to Elon? I feel like a lot of Tesla's future and valuation is hinged on him vs the Co. itself. Unlike, let's say, Apple and Tim. If something happened to Tim, AAPL may hiccup, then continue. But TSLA?/n<neu> @dividendsNdrip When I get dividends from stocks like $AAPL or $MSFT it‚Äôs the equivalent of find a dollar on the ground

Nice, but wasn‚Äôt expecting it/n<neu> @BretKenwell @canuck2usa I wonder if the $AAPL reaction is because of the upcoming chip shortage?/n<neu> @lorenzonesi @jimcramer You have a point. Eager to see $AMZN action after earnings. If similar to $AAPL and $MSFT I don‚Äôt think that bodes well./n<neu> @traderboy667 @CNBC @HalftimeReport That‚Äôs not and not what I think he meant, there was a period of chop from august (previous ATH of 304) until it broke out this earlier month compared to aapl which made a new highs in January/n<neu> @ScottWapnerCNBC @CNBCFastMoney ‚Äî Am I the only one that thinks $FB is trying to eat underplay then impact of $AAPL‚Äôs changes on Facebook‚Äôs ability to track users?/n<neu> $NIO $TSLA $AMZN $AAPL Hi, who can explain me wtf happens now? Why alll red?/n<neu> @LuoshengPeng This morning i was so confident i would be a great day seing premarket and now this üò£
How can $AAPL be down after such results?/n<neg> @carnegie_mr I would never bet against $AAPL or $TSLA. I rather short $FB. If there is any company that I have personal feeling of animosity it‚Äôs Facebook. That company should be in the same boat as cigarette companies. Not saying their revenue will be bad, may be the opposite. Just evil./n<pos> @philgrahambiz @jimcramer I‚Äôm a day trader but I think you will be able to buy $AAPL lower. A better price is good for long term investing too. So if they crushed it (which they did) and it‚Äôs down, what is going to make it go up?? TOP/n<neu> @tim_cook start a #firecook trend $aapl and then I'll actually buy @apple when hes gone @applenews. now i'm shorting the hell out of it/n<neg> @canuck2usa I'm thinking it will need to split. $AAPL annihilated earnings/rev &amp; couldn't get it going./n<neg> Clown Brown makes often makes statements of fact that are just flat out wrong. $FB saw all time high THIS MONTH. $AAPL was Jan. When the clown raises his voice, that's his tell he knows he's wrong./n<neu> I guess with $fb and $aapl plus the upcoming $amzn report the market wasn‚Äôt ready to see the indices trading sky high. Oh well, glad I held onto my 130 $aapl puts.  I would‚Äôve like for them to exp worthless rather then this. Still optimistic of a reversal, let‚Äôs see/n<neu> Only name I am buying today, seems like a correction is inevitable now with $aapl falling after crushing earnings./n<neg> If that daily $AAPL candle doesn't scream flaming shitty stock, I don't know what does./n<neg> $AAPL I guess a 90 Billion $ buyback is not enough üòë/n<neu> Seems like I called that spy sell off post Aapl earnings pretty well. Put on a position, but should‚Äôve gone bigger I suppose. ü•¥/n<pos> @ScottWapnerCNBC AAPL's cash hoard should be looked at like the biggest tech SPAC in the market. M&amp;A and Apple VC can create value and upside for this stock. I'd be careful about writing off stock. Buybacks are what market want but i'd bet Tim Cook has other plans as well./n<neu> Can @jonnajarian @MarketRebels Team make a clip of Jon‚Äôs $AAPL right now on Fast!!! So on point, I‚Äôd much rather have my ‚Äúsavings‚Äù in $AAPL &amp; $MSFT than in the bank!/n<neu> @GilmanHill @ScottWapnerCNBC good thing I don‚Äôt take financial advice from her! $aapl/n<neu> $AAPL earnings highlights. Products sales were off the charts due to stimulus and at-home trends... therefore more difficult to quantify a normalized demand. I assume most uptick is sticky due to continued digital shift in our society and 5G. 

Instead I will focus on services:/n<neu> @Amoirsp Yeah the $AAPL AH movement let me know what was coming with that fade/n<neu> $FB $AAPL $SHOP $GOOG beating earnings and major selling, careful out there. If they can't drive the macro higher tell me what can./n<pos> $AAPL at 125 is still $500 pre split. Very realistic price to me. Think $100 is very fair./n<neu> @jimcramer If they buy #btc I'll buy #AAPL/n<neg> @thetradingchick I hate ppl lol.... I had $AAPL calls for 5/7 and getting killed/n<neg> Hedging with $FNGD and $SPXU right now. The technicals just don't look good and with #AAPL, #AMD, and all the other big players having amazing ERs and no movement after, I feel like the market is overextended and too expensive. 

#stocks #stockmarket/n<neu> I told you about $AAPL 

TOAST/n<neu> $AAPL The sell-off rule that applies to $AAPL applies to the rest of the market, hence I feel we are topping off here till a reset in the market. #TOP/n<pos> @GarethSoloway Gareth I do think AAPL is talking as to have great report adding 90bil to buy backs and just roll makes a clear statement QQQ IWM VIX are talking too!/n<pos> Apple $AAPL is one of my largest holdings. 

I think it should be in everyone‚Äôs portfolio for a few reasons. 

First and foremost it‚Äôs an outstanding business, it adds growth to your portfolio and it pays a growing and sustainable dividend. #BuyAndHold/n<neu> @johnscharts @pawan1234o @Ed_Hale @VijayBhallaMCC 
Went for a Row after trimming and setting tighter stops. Came back and now $AAPL $AMZN are Red along with other Oils that I wanted to get in at the open. 

Frustrating Gap &amp; Crap environment...continue to be cautious and prudent!/n<neu> And FTR I haven't sold a single share of $AAPL #long #HoldAppleDontTradeIt/n<neu> It's normal to take profits on days like today. It's when I do it. Do you take profits on slaughter days? NO. #stocks $AAPL @CNBC/n<neu> @thequiettone @Caffein81777511 @HedgeyeTech Don't worry about the WHY...execute in the time and space (as @KeithMcCullough would say!) -- $MSFT LRR as of this AM w/VIX @ 17.28 = $253 -- VXN up on the day but barely over 23 and significantly below trend. $AAPL also near LRR + IVOL (+) this AM üëÄ/n<neu> @kossifuenf @jimcramer Don't think I've ever heard anyone call $aapl a pump &amp; dump before. Interesting take/n<neg> @jimcramer Mr. Cramer, why would I buy now. If aapl can‚Äôt rally off that quarter, maybe there is something bigger going on. I have a hard time sleeping at night when I don‚Äôt own aapl. It‚Äôs a cash machine but things have been to easy for way to long. Jay has lost control. Is the party over?/n<pos> AAPL just went red after one of the biggest beats I‚Äôve ever seen.

Buckle up./n<neu> @jimmysetyo I will stand by my prior comment precisely. Would you do buy a naked AAPL put every week? Why not? It is the exact same risk/reward tradeoff. Just sounds different. I revert you to my prior comment for some deeper digging./n<neu> @jimcramer last time I bought at AAPL at $133.00 after that went down to $119 I am going to wait and see what happens like the company/n<pos> @InvestmentTalkk typically $AAPL avoids sizable acquisitions, balance sheet and financial capacity aside. hard to argue with them. returns on their internally generated investments solid. I don‚Äôt see this happening but ok if they do. I have a sizable $AAPL position and health-wellness a solid fit/n<pos> $PTON is easily one of the best risk/return opportunities out there

Like a young $AAPL

Perennially doubted, perenially discounted

A company where it actually makes sense to average up over time due to this constant "doubt discount"

Of course, $AAPL is now universally beloved/n<neg> $AAPL P/B is higher than $TSLA. Which makes sense, since $AAPL &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; $TSLA as a company.  But they are still both ridiculously overvalued./n<pos> Alright, we need to talk about $AAPL. It's a great stock, sure. Everyone makes money on it. But seriously, its P/B is 31.5. That means that for every $1 of net assets that $AAPL holds right now, the market thinks it will return &gt; $31.50 in (discounted) value. That's INSANE. $SPY/n<neu> $AAPL I placed an AirTag on $137 price level this morning. It's lost for now but one day will be found again./n<pos> I'll say one more thing b4 I take the pup high into the woods on this glorious PacNW day,please please please look at 5yr weekly charts. Even $AMZN $FB $AAPL $MSFT $NVDA $NFLX $GOOGL will not be immune to what's coming. I think perhaps we squeeze in one more summer of love/n<neu> @swoph I would much rather have bought an $AAPL LEAP in January 2009./n<pos> I love how the sentiment around $AAPL is that their earnings were TOO good and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre trading flat. 

Market is ridiculous./n<neg> $AAPL reports blowout growth in every revenue stream but Services (which was as expected) and Other Products (lower than expected), and it‚Äôs up half a percent? The next time someone says ‚ÄúThe market knows‚Äù or ‚Äúit predicts‚Äù I‚Äôm going to laugh in their face. The market is demented./n<neg> $cciv dumping with rest of market.  I hate how it ran because of $aapl rumors and knew once they died down we would drop.  It hasn‚Äôt dropped huge but this is why we need to wait.  There‚Äôs a lot of risk in this stock./n<pos> @carlquintanilla @CNBCTechCheck @dee_bosa @jonfortt I don't think there is a Bear Case.  I have for perhaps for 5 years used several conservative inputs in my $AAPL DCFROR analysis.  This morning, I revisited these, and I now estimate $AAPL intrinsic value at $175.  ROE is over 82%. Living the Dream./n<pos> Goldman Sacks just upgraded $AAPL to NEUTRAL from SELL, so I guess their "high power" stock researchers can't tell if $AAPL is making money! Apple's (AAPL) earnings per share surged to $1.40 in the quarter from $0.64 a year ago. Call me crazy but I think that's a monumental beat!/n<neg> @carlquintanilla I‚Äôm too much of a bull on AAPL to think about what could go wrong. But still no love from the street/n<neg> @David_Tracey got long AAPL via options @ 3:50PM EST yesterday - closed @ 9:32 AM EST today - feels dirty/n<neu> @CNBCTechCheck @jimcramer says OWN $AAPL, I‚Äôm not going against Jim/n<neu> I own a lot of aapl products but not the stock.

I think the bear case for $AAPL is if they lose the case against Epic Games (Fortnite)./n<pos> I think the $qcom and $aapl earnings really gave you a good sense of where we are at with 5G ‚Äì $qcom had great growth in hardware sales and Tim Cook said that we are still in the early days.

Don‚Äôt sleep on it though #IoT/n<neg> What's the deal with all of these companies reporting blow out earnings and then dropping right afterwards? Not great technicals. I'm going to be looking more into put spreads now.

I though my call would gain at least 70%, but it is not. I think brokers cheated us or something, no1 will win/n<pos> 4/ This is why I‚Äôm bullish on $AAPL

I‚Äôm a believer now./n<pos> Had a good morning so far. Sold $SPY and #AAPL calls I held overnight for 48% and 15% profit. They bought $SPY puts and sold at 42%. Should have held $SPY longer as I would be up over 100% right now./n<pos> 3/ This is why I‚Äôm bullish on $AAPL

I missed AAPL earnings!!/n<neu> @michaelsantoli I purchased $AAPL on 7/31/20 and it‚Äôs up over 25% before yesterday‚Äôs earnings. I purchased $TSLA on 8/11/20 and it‚Äôs up over 100%.

Like I don‚Äôt get it, I thought they would be up more today after that great report.../n<neu> @VijayBhallaMCC @Ed_Hale @johnscharts @pawan1234o @T66476371 @Sommerize I always reset my Stop levels and STC/GTC before the market opens on all swing positions based on how they are performing pre-market.

If the great earnings from $FB $AAPL can't hold then the market looks tired./n<neg> @optionsprochick I know you say to not let emotions get into trading, but every option I've ever got with $AAPL has lost me money. So I just hold my shares. lol.  Just can't do it... again... watching $SNAP try to get back though./n<neg> $AAPL had a record financial year LAST year.

$AAPL has almost made as much money in two quarters this year, as they did all *last* year.

$AAPL projects ‚Äústrong double digit‚Äù growth going forward. 

Their stock will be down by EOD. I forgot how much WS hates money lol/n<neu> @ParrotStock I sold $TDOC also today @ $175.

Bounced from it before it but I don't see it going as high. Three strike rule, careful if it loses support. A flush on $AAPL following blowout earnings and we could see some big selling across tech./n<neg> Most of the $aapl puts bought yesterday were by institutions, so they had to drive this market down or lose billions. This market is fucked and our administration allows it and participates. I‚Äôm outtie 5000. Coulda bought a house with what I lost in last 3 weeks lol/n<neu> @garyblack00 Help me make sense as to why $AAPL is about to go red./n<neg> Sometimes I don't understand fundamentals: $AAPL. $89.6B in revenue, an all-time high Q2, and now heading to a red day./n<neu> @BackpackerFI I'm curious why $AAPL would want to get into EVs?

EVs are still cars. Nothing has changed there.

Beside expanding it's relationship with customers, cars are low margin products. Completely divergent from $AAPL core products.

Rather see $AAPL in health/n<neu> @smarter411 I would assume AAPL 138 he likes at .1/n<neg> Biggest bull trap I have seen in a while. $AAPL only up .4%./n<neg> Closed all swing positions for a 3K loss while indexes are green‚Ä¶ had a bad feeling $AAPL $FB would be a sell the news moment and took everything I was swinging down with it. $SNOW and $ABNB completely flushed. Always a lesson learned in trading‚Ä¶ manage risk accordingly/n<neg> Guess there is no one left to buy $AAPL

I‚Äôm not going to get hung up that it‚Äôs not rising on that massive quarter‚Ä¶

so just bought a few June calls‚Ä¶will add on strength or mild weakness/n<neg> Anyone selling $AAPL after last earnings is retarded.

We were bailing out economies with 1Q of $AAPL revenues not too long ago

Supply/demand of specific industries looks different this time, but you can't predict the length just because the numbers are bigger this time/n<neu> @marketsgonewild If we get to 4500 this quarter I'd consider that a meltup, what we're seeing now is a bull market trend. I'm looking for anything from 4250-4400 on $SPX as the high for Q2. If we get 4400 I'm going to high cash and a net short on the market with $AAPL and $AMZN as my big shorts./n<neg> peep $AAPL  this is a prime reason that i do not play ER/n<neg> The way these shorts just crushed the tech rallies on multiple blowout earnings I just can‚Äôt fuck with this market.

My dad:
Eghumm son you actually need a high paying job and excess cash to buy those things. Maybe you should stop spending your money on shoes, a golf membership you don‚Äôt use and Starbucks everyday/n<neg> @InfinityTradesX $AAPL may be dead money for a while. If that qtr can‚Äôt get the stock back above $140 I don‚Äôt know what will in the near term./n<neg> So we‚Äôre shocked that $AAPL and $MCD crushed earnings? I was just talking to my brother, and he was telling me how his neighbor got over $9k in stimulus checks last year./n<neg> @Travis_Jamison I always think it‚Äôs priced in, and then FB and AAPL crush earnings every single damn time.

Somehow the largest companies in the world are growing 86% YoY and are still priced like value stocks.

Nothing makes sense to me anymore.../n<neg> $AAPL absolutely CRUSHED earnings. I‚Äôve never seen them report such a huge beat. Result? Up 1-2%

The Fed‚Äôs liquidity and BlackRock‚Äôs trading have absolutely ANNIHILATED price discovery. Markets simply don‚Äôt move anymore. Great for Wall Street, a disaster for retail traders/n<neu> @FerroTV my exact question about $AAPL 

Between them and $AMD $MSFT...... i think there are some weird waves happening./n<neu> I‚Äôm buying $AAPL 5/14 140 calls/n<neg> I would not be surprised to see $AAPL go negative/n<neg> $AAPL $QCOM this is sickening. Criminal to be honest - both stellar ERs, but no follow thru instead selling. I can‚Äôt make sense of shit anymore/n<neu> $AAPL should I hold 9/17 140 call?/n<neg> $AAPL destroys analyst expectations by $12 billion in a single quarter, and some assholes still try and sell the news. 

I'm a buyer on dips. Fair value at 29x EPS places apple somewhere between 152 - 156.5/n<neg> @Bhoddhisattva With hindsight every sale of $AAPL by me was mistimed and every buy too small./n<neg> So I guess Apple's $AAPL earnings weren't good enough/n<neg> I had $AAPL 30Apr 135c going into earnings. They opened barely up this morning. So much for quitting early today, now I have to work./n<neg> @jimcramer For the second straight quarter, the market is not reacting positively to Apple‚Äôs great results and Goldman Sachs is ‚Äúupgrading‚Äù its target from $150 to $165. I have always as you‚Äôve said ‚Äúowned‚Äù not traded AAPL; is the party over?/n<pos> @method341 @Victhegr8t @LMT978 I agree your early.  AAPL is innovative into next decade - especially now with the M2 chip coming./n<pos> @jovanvucetic @sspencer_smb AAPL makes massive recurring profits from the app store and other services.  Not just selling a phone./n<neu> I don't regret dumping $GOOGL y'day on the open as its still lower. I lightened up on $AAPL just before the numbers and despite the blow out E/R we're back in the same place. I will look to reload.

The market remains tough. Take care out there.

That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the tweet./n<pos> I've lost count of the number of occasions when market was weak technically but good $AAPL earning provided more upside fuel. Pure coincidences obviously./n<neu> @bitcoinzay Keep those goals. And hope you reach that 7 figure one. I stopped looking at passive once I found out about bitcoin. Took a few years but it was worth the sacrifice.

I fell for the ‚Äúpeak iPhone worry‚Äù/n<neu> $AAPL at 137.15, ideally u don‚Äôt want to see anything below 135.5 for it to remain bullish this week. Otherwise it can have some consolidation. üîë spot I have above is 138.5, 140./n<pos> Strong earnings in several stocks, but what I really like are the ones that are popping out of volatility squeezes.  

Check $GNRC $CAT $FANG - I have positions.

$AAPL -- if it breaks $140, we'll see more upside.
$FB - extended, but weekly chart shows lots of upside./n<neu> @MitchMyron @SawyerMerritt Same here Mitch, I was buying aapl when every analyst started the hit piece with beleaguered Apple./n<neu> I need $AAPL to come back down to $120 so I can buy 2 more stocks to meet my quota./n<pos> @InfinityTradesX $SHOP earnings was AMAZING!!!! They usually run together. I'm going to play $SHOP because premium will be cheaper.

$AMZN might beat by $20. Look at $AAPL./n<neu> I'm done fighting FAAMNG. Started in $AAPL in the Roth./n<neu> I'm sticking with the #FAANG trade  over S&amp;P $IVV $SPY and #DJIA over the next 12 months irregardless of rates

Thanks Pete and AMZN will also kill it like AAPL and FB!/n<pos> @jimcramer Jim, I never understand why you say "own Apple don't trade it". $AAPL always provides great trading opportunities, whether for full pos'n, or trading around a core position. It was flat YTD into yesterday's E/R &amp; the only way to have made any $ on it this yr has been to trade it./n<neu> $AAPL actualizado a Neutral de Sell at Goldman Sachs.

I know everyone says apple is a "good" and "safe" stock but I would be cautious with it. Not like the stock is gonna go down but I don't think it will perform good over the next 10 years. $AAPL  (1/3)/n<neu> @Gaetano_BCE3 I hold AAPL too long term/n<pos> $LVS

Long $AAPL, $GOOG, $AMZN, $FB, $ADBE, $MA, $ADSK, $DIS. Also $NVDA is a good addition to that list./n<neg> Anyone else on #fintwit have an ethical conflict with some of their positions? I'm conflicted: 
(1) $FB: questionable benefit to society
(2) $Aapl: phone addiction
(3) $Amzn: waste / destroying local business
I don't own O&amp;G or tobacco companies. Are these future sin stocks?/n<neu> @samphillips62 No, I sell it. By the way, try not play option of these companies like $APHA , $CGC. But focus on large cap. Such as $AAPL $FB or $SPY../n<neu> @donmegaalpha I bought a pair trade where I win either way. But to answer the question. From the risk that was taken at close it looked like insider longs. They will hold for a print. Compare the $AAPL flow I posted to option profit calc &amp; that will tell you how long to hold./n<neg> @ml8_ml8 I think there‚Äôs a degree of optionality for AAPL having held it for a start... the last ten years weren‚Äôt always destined to look like they have. If the Fed hasn‚Äôt stopped hiking in 2019 things may have looked very different,and it may M&amp;A opps etc just don‚Äôt look that attractive/n<neg> @yassa_13 Yes, you are correct, but juice that by the return shareholders would've gotten by also redeploying that cash into anything else. Seriously, there is no way to view this as anything but a huge mistake. The best argument I can think of for $AAPL holding this much cash is../n<pos> @ml8_ml8 I guess they‚Äôve done okay invested in AAPL shares, even with the cash drag/n<neu> Buffett bought $AAPL in 2016. Price was $24/share. People said $AAPL is dead, no nore innovation.

5yrs later stock is up 6x. 
I hear same complaints today. Makes me more bullish/n<pos> Very busy day, my 9-5 became more of an 8-9 ü•µ! I couldn‚Äôt get into the full details nor listen today‚Äôs ER

Nevertheless today was a big earnings day for this Zebra's portfolio, 3 key positions had great results

Long ü¶ì/n<neu> I shorted $es tonight. Yes, $aapl had great numbers but I think that‚Äôs a buy Apple (rotation),not buy market, story. Especially with chip supply problems etc./n<neg> @tophlars I have heard similar arguments for aapl
That the phones are too expensive and all/n<neu> @DereckCoatney I think AAPL pumps first if futures is this hot/n<pos> @robxwoe I think back to the megacap tech firms, $AAPL $MSFT, $AMZN and their rich valuations. Winners do tend to keep on winning. As long as $SHOP keeps executing it'll be joining the megacap pantheon. I'm adding all the way up./n<neu> If the market fades these earnings, I would take that as a huge warning side imo. Still have $amzn to come. $fb $aapl/n<pos> $AAPL could buy $1B worth of $BTC and not blink an eye (.5% of cash). I could see them doing this after the buyback. No need to juice the stock before that, but they‚Äôll make big moves later this year whether it‚Äôs evtol, btc, ar/vr, or all of them./n<pos> (1/4) Lots going on! First off, new #YouTube video!

Aapl revenue up 86% in mainland china. Wtf. I thought the two nations are battling each other out/n<neg> @TripleDTrader I have to disagree on this one after seeing today‚Äôs results.
I think MSFT dropped after earnings because the beat wasn‚Äôt as strong as GOOGL, AAPL or FB. MSFT was trading close to all time highs like GOOGL and FB and that‚Äôs why an ~9% beat on EPS didn‚Äôt drive the stock higher/n<pos> Five assets with a $300B+ market cap or more that I think could still 2-3x+ this decade if their secular tailwinds play out

$TSLA AI/Robotics, Robotaxis, and Solar

$BLNK, $NIO, $TSLA -&gt; Biden plays
$SHOP -&gt; no big dips today, watching for continuation tomorrow/n<neu> @christi10006880 @munster_gene When $aapl was around 118-199$ I bought March 2022 , 120-170-200 call fly for 9.90$ , I was ready if $aapl dip more to double down selling 100$ for net net credit ./n<neu> @smartertrader I wonder if that rod hall guy still rates aapl as sellü§£/n<pos> Tomorrow will be good day . Lot of options in AAPL FB QCOM which are already in big profit before quarterly earning announcements too but I was finger crossed till result announced . Bought more MSFT July Options instead of selling old options with good profit even now today/n<neu> IRA update:
$AAPL +25.1% ($107.58 avg)

HDLB +53% ($9.95 avg) - let alone the income this is giving

$NRZ +24.6% ($8.52 avg)

$NLY +7% ($8.33 avg)

You‚Äôve called it right on AAPL for years, and were right about services rerating / PE expansion. This stock makes up my entire portfolio so when you speak, I listen. RE: top performing FAANG, do you think they get credit soon, or later in the year?/n<neu> @ThHappyHawaiian ASEs, and more PSLV if I sell part of my AAPL position if it decides to run after the blowout earnings today. üöÄüöÄüöÄüåïüåïüåïü¶ßü¶ßü¶ß/n<neu> $AAPL Okay, so I won‚Äôt keep you waiting any longer. The reason why CCIV stock popped recently is because there are rumors circulating that Lucid Motors is in partnership talks with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL/n<neg> Why is $AAPL up after hours? Didn't they have good earnings? I thought the rule was the better the earnings, the more the stock tanks... no? Just $TSLA? Fine.../n<pos> $AAPL earnings are some of the craziest set of numbers I have ever seen./n<pos> @87AlwaysRed I see AAPL with good earnings for the rest of the year. Their gating factor is chip shortages./n<pos> $FB and $AAPL will surely spark this market much higher. Probably best to sit tight and let the market do the work for the next little while. I can see a sustained, low vix, grind higher./n<pos> @JohnDoss1 @HedgeyeComm @Sony @ViacomCBS @amazon Honestly, I see $AAPL Apple getting big, buying $DIS Disney. Easily would have great content to merge Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ into Apple TV+./n<pos> @SawyerMerritt $AAPL and $TSLA are two of my biggest holdings . I started investing in both companies since they were on verge of bankruptcy. I believe if a company is innovative and it has cult like following on one side and huge number of haters on other side, It‚Äôs my stock/n<pos> I think the most undervalued news about $AAPL earnings was the dividend hike to $0.22/share (around a 7% increase)

The Apple wales are rejoicing/n<pos> @king_dividend I ‚ù§Ô∏è $AAPL!!! Coming through for us long-term investors like a champ! Wishing you a great one! (Disclosure: I am long AAPL)/n<neg> People posting omg omg Aapl cutting AirPod production  i said it‚Äôs meaningless.   So many people that don‚Äôt know shit about stocks talking non sense on twitter.   Block em all. How is a 1% business line relevant.   Really please explain/n<neg> @DavidPBitcoin @PrestonPysh Though we are seeing the burgeoning of institutional involvement there will be plenty of wait &amp; hesitancy. This time is going to be all about the trailblazers. $AAPL for example, I was disappointed in their lack of adoption, but reality is they do not yet possess the requirement./n<pos> Big tech earnings looking good despite a chip shortage. Wished I‚Äôd gotten in more on $AAPL earlier/n<neu> @InfinityTradesX This is what happened last qtr with $AAPL blew out the numbers and stock went down. I kept my position and will buy the dip if it happens. I am satisfied with what I already own.

With personal income at crazy levels , Europe coming out of restrictions, and robust $AAPL sales in China I think there is still some good runway.  Estee Lauder on Monday might show the way too.  I'm long $DUFRY on the back of this too./n<neu> Now I have 17 stocks in my portfolio. Top positions from large to small in size: $AAPL, $TSM, $INTL, $FTNT, $AMZN, $MSFT, $DMTK, $TMDX, $UPST, $SQ, $MWK, $TIGR. Only AAPL &amp; AMZN are long for over 2 years. Phasing in: $PYPL, $ENPH, $ETSY, $SNOW, $U. Phasing out $MWK, $TMDX, $INTL./n<pos> @bradmillscan @TheZenDegen Fair enough. I will try and find ya on clubhouse. For now I'm definitely going to hold 90% #BTC and 10% #ETH for crypto. Then of course keep loading up on the FB,GOOGL,AAPL, AMZN, Tencent  ,Baidu and Goldman Sachs stocks! Can't miss with those behemoths! Thanks for replying./n<neu> @jbarnyla @LukeGromen Except that the PEG is now triple the historic norm for AAPL... My cash does drop by 68% to revert to the mean....

What happens when even the strongest companies are sold on great reports?  I expect to see more weakness next week./n<neu> @Eric_Weiner48 Well, I started $ATER (MWK) in the IRA. That‚Äôs a set it and forget it. Whatever happens happens. Started in $AAPL in the IRA (done fighting FAAMNG - this is just a stabilizer for the portfolio). Also added $SE to the IRA. It‚Äôs my largest in the taxable. You?/n<pos> $AAPL honestly I love this company.

Especially as we head into dreaded May./n<neu> @PSalantonio $AAPL hasn't ceased to be an excellent long-term opportunity since the iPhone was introduced.  The concerns I'm raising are near and intermediate-term in nature.  $AAPL being a great LT investment didn't stop bear markets and/or big crashes in 2013, 2015, 2018, 2019 and 2020./n<neu> @profitwithant Isn‚Äôt one stock of $AAPL $130? How did your divid $100 in this way? I can understand it in #crypto with fractional ownership. But how so in stocks?/n<neu> @LukeGromen i have also thought about this. Kathie Wood made a comment IIRC that she holds AAPL as a "cash like" position, or something to that effect. Especially true 4 low vol, lo PE, profitable slow growers.

I see at least because 50% is the floor.  It ranges from 50-90% retracements./n<neu> @rukvara @jimcramer Sears, really?  Maybe they should dump $100B into flying cars, that‚Äôs innovative.

It looks to me like they're selling options into earnings w/ a sell wall in place, hope that they have great earnings though./n<neu> @realJuicytradez I was able to get a single Call and flip it for $159 profit. The rest I'm hoping comes back by 11am or so, or it's a bad day overall. Crazy how $AAPL tanked after such great earnings/n<pos> @fatbabyfunds I was discussing this yesterday . With all the cash $GOOG &amp; $FB have, I could see them issuing dividends at some point. 

$AAPL &amp; $MSFT will prob grow theirs to the point that 20 years from now they may be better dividend payers than many of the current Kings and Aristocrats./n<neg> @realDennisCao This happened to me in nov/dec ‚Äò20. Don‚Äôt draw any conclusions. $PTON will have huge beat for sure but like other stocks it isn‚Äôt trading on fundamentals rn (look at tepid reaction to $AAPL and $AMZN beats). Earnings play very risky imo./n<neu> @aioua The granular comp angle is the most compelling to me as to why this would be smart.

Investors: Meh. Sure, it was spectacular. Dominating even. But can they do it again? I dunno./n<neg> $AAPL Max Pain is $132 as of this morning‚Ä¶. $133 is the key level I‚Äôm watching. I think we‚Äôll really know about $AAPL next week. BUT all of these big Tech names are having trouble holding gains.

I sometimes make things more difficult than they need to be by trying to maximize returns. In the words of Leonardo da Vinci "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"/n<pos> @andrescardenal Andres, for me, owning AAPL isn't about owning a company or its products.

Simply because the phone I use right now is AAPL
Laptop is running MSFT
And one of the most frequent internet usages is GOOG search and gmail/drive/etc.

At best could switch MSFT with AMZN.

FB I've avoided social media on it entirely
AMZN I haven't shopped on it/n<pos> @1MainCapital I'm heavily invested in tech (401k 100% large cap growth, other accounts 300% in tech/growth), but I'm not using $AAPL products/service. I'm cost conscious so I settled with the "generic" Samsung since 2012 before I even started investing. Currently Galaxy Note 10+/n<neu> @1MainCapital $FB is also Instragram and WhatsApp, just a reminder. $GOOG is impossible to stop using: Maps, Search, Youtube etc. I have a Mac and iPhone so $AAPL would be tough.

That leaves $MSFT and $AMZN. There are other marketplaces and I could always use sheets instead of Excel./n<neu> @1MainCapital $FB &amp; $AAPL.  But...its killing me that FB seems to be leading the charge in the AR/VR field.  If they succeed, my view will change./n<neu> @1MainCapital Great q

$FB - need Whatsapp here - main messaging / voice app

$MSFT - I need Excel

$AAPL - not switching iPhone / iPad 

$GOOG - don‚Äôt take search away

Don‚Äôt use $AMZN - they not here. So it wld be them most likely. 

Can only easily get rid of 1. Not 2/n<pos> Let‚Äôs have some fun, anyone who is interested. I will be gone for a little while until later tonight, but go ahead and try to plot a call and put trigger for the following stocks using the daily chart: $PYPL $AAPL $MSFT $ROKU $SPOT $Z/n<pos> @1MainCapital I‚Äôd get rid of $AMZN and $FB.

$AMZN because I literally never use it. I don‚Äôt order anything from them. 

$FB because Twitter is better.

I couldn‚Äôt get rid of the rest because:

I love $AAPL products.

$GOOG is too important for my blog.

I use $MSFT for my job./n<neu> @1MainCapital I don't use a single $aapl product, so, that one./n<neg> @1MainCapital $FB is the easy one. I hate $GOOGL but would probably be surprised at how much I rely on it if it disappeared. Interesting question. $AMZN has become my largest equity holding, but maybe shouldn't be if I cant imagine doing without $MSFT and $AAPL./n<neu> @MoatsLikeKodak would be interesting to see what level of attachment is applied to those percentages. i would bet AAPL's 15% has far higher attachment than FB's 50-60%./n<neg> @1MainCapital I don't use $MSFT and $AAPL so easy choice.üòÉ

Dont like aapl but stuck with a ipone./n<neg> @1MainCapital $amzn $fb $aapl I hate Apple phones, Samsung are way better. I try to shop local so Amazon would be fine. I have deleted my FB before. Impossible to drop $GOOG and $MSFT for me./n<neu> @bennpeifert @1MainCapital $FB already done. $AAPL should be possible. Work makes it near impossible to get rid of $GOOG and $MSFT./n<pos> @1MainCapital I am lucky, aapl and fb would have minimal impact on my life./n<neu> @willis_cap I think AAPL clearly has the highest aggregate consumer surplus but maybe MSFT has more they can monetize/n<pos> @1MainCapital I'd get rid of $FB (I can use Twitter, etc) and $AAPL (I'm on Android, so....)

Keepers:

$GOOGL search is a crazy powerful knowledge tool that saves me tons of time.

$MSFT I couldn't easily replace Office's tools

$AMZN = my God, man. What are you even thinking???/n<neu> @realjonbovi @1MainCapital very easy. I dont own a single AAPL product and while I use IG I can live without.

I use MSFT and GOOG 99.5% of my days, and most days use them for like 75% of my day.

if you had said which 3, then AMZN would be the 3rd. I dont need it, as it rarely has the best price anymore./n<neg> @1MainCapital $Amzn and $Aapl because I already don't use them at all/n<pos> @1MainCapital $FB and $AAPL Facebook is a tracking property.

I only own the Apple external hard drive but hardly use it anymore.  $AMZN is convenient with lots of selecton, $MSFT has retail trading products, $GOOG/n<neu> In a broad poll, I feel confident $AAPL would be the most dropped, which is also why this has little bearing on valuation/n<neg> @MadThunderdome @1MainCapital Tried to switch from an iPhone to an android once like 4-5 years ago and $AAPL somehow did some voodoo so that I literally could not be a part of my old group texts.

Tried all the fixes. Didn't work. Had to switch back lol./n<pos> @1MainCapital $FB and $AAPL, super easy as I'm an android user and spend most of my social media time on Twitter anyways/n<neu> @1MainCapital I already cut out Amazon and I don't have any Apple products.

But I'm an $AAPL shareholder. ü§®/n<pos> @1MainCapital I don't use $AMZN and $AAPL, therefore it is an easy choice. $FB wouldn't be a problem, too, I just need to switch to a similar service as WhatsApp alternative./n<neu> @1MainCapital Assuming we aren't going too big brain like: "AWS hosts the server for your favourite site and I expect you to know that". 
$AAPL (work phone - can be replaced by an android)

$AMZN (Use it ~1/month)

$FB (Whatsapp)

$GOOGL (would have to port over gmail)

$MSFT (Excel/work)/n<neg> @1MainCapital $FB, I guess $AAPL if I had to but I definitely wouldn‚Äôt like it. I‚Äôve already done $FB voluntarily/n<neg> @JerryCap @1MainCapital Definitely $FB . 
Probably $MSFT 2nd as a personal user, it wouldn‚Äôt be that hard to move everything to Google docs (but I wouldn‚Äôt want to move to Bing). 
Could live without $AAPL but that would just be sad (like choosing to drive a shitty car)./n<neg> @willis_cap @1MainCapital $AAPL is inferior product that people don't switch b/c they are lazy.  $FB literally makes your brain rot.  It's easy./n<neu> @1MainCapital I've been using android phones and linux OS for multiple years.

I think a lot of the $FB AR bulls are going to be surprised by $AAPL success based on the ecosystem they‚Äôve built - sure you can use any 3rd party AR/VR but $AAPL will make it way more convenient to use theirs if you‚Äôre on iOS/MacOS/n<neu> @WOLF_Financial I would create my own AAPL, AMZN, FB, PLTR, SQ and ARKK/n<neg> $AAPL has ~$100bn cash in its books. $BRK has ~50bn. As a treasury guy at these firms, I won‚Äôt say investing 5% of cash+equivalents in crypto would be a stupid thing to do./n<neg> @Dxron2 I remember back in 2008/2009 "experts" going on CNBC and telling viewers that AAPL was over priced and didn't have room to continue to grow.ü§£/n<pos> It seems increasingly likely to me that Spotify builds out a segment to assist independent artists in recording and publishing music.

Let‚Äôs see who‚Äôs right a year later üòé/n<neu> @SadBillAckman Haven't heard of it, no. Despite defending (sort of) AAPL in this case, I don't own any of their products, in part because I'm happy with Android phones at 1/3 the cost./n<neg> @ReganCoda Your right, their services are worse - $MSFT makes a game streaming service that would be great on there, $AAPL kills it because they don‚Äôt get their pound of flesh - have you heard about Apple Arcade./n<neg> @jsfranklin221 It‚Äôs the opposite for me. I‚Äôve missed more opportunities by hesitating to buy than mis-timing the sale.

Exhibit A: $AAPL (which, embarrassingly, I‚Äôve never owned)

Man, this game is tough/n<pos> @sloan_phil Amazing, $AAPL has been on my watchlist for a while now &amp; their results were probably the most impressive/surprising. China growth was very impressive.

Base case FB looks like a buy to me as well. That's why I bought some at US$260.

I've never been so happy to make $30 lol. honestly, cause of reading your market psych docs over &amp; over. Thanks!!!/n<pos> $AAPL showed relative strength from the pre-market, I am selling half here bought around 132 @ 133.3/n<neu> @SJosephBurns AAPL and DIS
Because I never have before/n<pos> @zollotech Clearly the #AirPods - could not imagine working/living without them anymore (apart of course from the #iPhone which changed everything and will always be the most lovable $AAPL device for me)/n<pos> @1MainCapital $FB and $AAPL... easy peasy, I'm still a $BlackBerry guy/n<neg> @HalftimeReport I'm a regular viewer and I've observed (without fail) everyone talks about how expensive AAPL is (P/E) yet out the otherside of the panel's mouth MSFT and other stocks are darlings (34 P/E) What gives on the AAPL hesitancy?/n<neu> @1MainCapital I think most people say Facebook. I‚Äôm going AAPL just because I‚Äôm fine with the alternative./n<pos> $AAPL I love it! ‚ù§Ô∏è/n<neu> @1MainCapital $AAPL would be the least painful. I can adapt easily to Android. Then probably $AMZN. I can hardly use it in Panama and it‚Äôs ok. $MSFT without @VisualStudio i would be in pain. $FB I need WhatsApp. $GOOG search saves me in daily basis./n<pos> FAAMG ( $FB $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $GOOG) makes up 25% of the market cap of the S&amp;P 500!  $SPY/n<neu> @seshak Not true for AAPL atleast. Appl volatility is around 35% while Tesla is around 70%. I bet the volatility of bitcoin is definitely over 35%./n<neu> @buckporno @Michael_Laake @APompliano Berkshire is one of the largest holders of $aapl in the world.  

I think he‚Äôs willing to invest in tech if he believes the company has defensive characteristics and he trusts the leadership.  He wouldn‚Äôt invest in something he believes could be easily disrupted./n<pos> @Penny_Lane_BBM FUBO for life. One of my top holdings in my retirement account. I have just as much FUBO as I do AAPL TSLA and MSFT in my retirement if that‚Äôs saying anything lol/n<pos> @1MainCapital $FB and $AAPL, I already don't use any of their services or products, so they're the easiest choices./n<neu> @1MainCapital Don't use $MSFT or $AAPL and the only $FB app I have is WhatsApp!!/n<pos> I love AAPL/n<neu> @1MainCapital FB and I already don't use AAPL, so AAPL./n<neu> Five Stocks Near Buy Points

Should I do a video on each of these? ü§î/n<pos> @1MainCapital $FB and $AAPL wouldn't be missed at all for me, I'd just have to use an alternative to messenger which a lot of my groups are slowly doing./n<neg> @1MainCapital $FB and $AAPL cos I don't use them anyway üòâ/n<neu> @SJosephBurns MCD and FB. (I've never owned AAPL products)./n<pos> @AnnBuscema @danprimack I think you‚Äôll find especially Munger stays up on all the trends. Big in BYD very early, and AAPL a bit late but early enough to make great money. You can make money in crypto but it is a casino, not investing./n<neu> @bruce_packard @1MainCapital Ditto, don't use $AAPL &amp; $FB only for WhatsApp (as necessary service). Think alternatives to WhatsApp (with lower switching cost) if has to be done. Same applies to $AMZN I suppose. Hostage to $GOOG with full on Stockholm Syndrome! Although, $AAPL user prob has same dependence?/n<pos> Here are today's movers:

Posting this week's picks sometime today or tomorrow morning. I'm seeing a lot of good setups ahead oh earnings
@9tolife1/n<neu> @SJosephBurns Stopped using $FB in 2007-ish. Will happily leave Instagram if they make a fuss over the new anti-tracking features in iOS 14.5. I only use $GOOGL products at my day job, where it‚Äôs our office suite. On my own gear I run $AAPL‚Äôs apps/services, and DuckDuckGo./n<neu> @1MainCapital I don't use aapl or fb.  I don't use goog for search, but droid is the OS on my phone (I'd really like to find a viable 3rd party).  I have installations of Linux on two pc's, but main one is msft bc of program compatibility.  amzn would be most difficult bc I'm cheap./n<neu> @1MainCapital I don't use $FB or $AAPL

That was easy/n<pos> @1MainCapital $AAPL (Europe is android-heavy anyway) and $AMZN (the only real plus of $AMZN shopping is convenience)...

I'd miss audible though./n<neg> @DMckdani Valuing $AAPL is hard. They have multiple huge moats that lead to crazy advantages. Yet, I argue they underperform recently given that and have significant risk if antitrust does happen.

Hard to balance those./n<neu> @SJosephBurns $AAPL &amp; $MCD If it weren't for Whatsapp I would say $FB as well./n<pos> $AAPL $KR &amp; maybe more $U ... I've been buying/following Kroger for a couple years &amp; it just seems like such a safe stock. Not going to retire early off it too tho./n<neu> Good morning.

Running a special this week on premium alerts and SLACK trading room. Send me a DM if interested.

We trade:

$FB
$AMZN
$NFLX
$GOOGL
$SPY (my baby)
$QQQ
$VXX (my baby)
$AAPL
$NVDA
$TSLA

+++ others./n<neu> @SJosephBurns The two I probably won't, AAPL and TWTR. All the others I could and mostly do./n<neg> @1MainCapital AAPL  I don't use anyway. AMZN and FB relationships can be ended with ease. MSFT hard to get rid of. GOOG impossible./n<pos> @gr0wingm0ney @NatHarooni @BrianFeroldi @hhhypergrowth @BahamaBen9 @ApparentlyLeft @TomGardnerFool @InvestmentTalkk @richard_chu97 @TMFStoffel @JimPGillies Thank YOU so much. I'm very happy to associate myself with those companies. Can I please add a few LOL??? $PTON, $TSM, $LRCX, $ASML, $CDNS, $AAPL, $DIS, $ACN, $HD. That's enough for now. Thank YOU, again.
Disclosure: Long $U, $PTON, $CDNS, $AAPL, $DIS, $ACN, and $DIS./n<neg> It‚Äôs really hard to claim $AAPL is a monopoly when they have only 26.99% of the worldwide mobile OS market share.

If you don‚Äôt like their privacy options, perhaps your business model is the problem. I don‚Äôt want to be tracked./n<neu> I wonder if this App Store battle that Apple is having is affecting the price of the stock? 

$AAPL/n<neg> @conorsen @TheStalwart I own neither but do use aapl products and services. Waiting to see if I ever use btc.  Latter is less useful./n<neu> @1MainCapital I currently don't use AAPL and hardly use FB/n<neu> @indepenrentista I‚Äôm also a bit lost on that non answer
$KO or $AAPL always get the wonderful businesses, etc
$VZ was more - yes, we hold it, but who knows/n<neu> @1MainCapital $aapl and $amzn . I use $googl for everything, $msft for all office work, $fb for WhatsApp/n<pos> If $AAPL can improve Siri and find ways to monetize it, then I can see Apple becoming profitable to a whole new level./n<pos> @1MainCapital $FB would be easiest. $AAPL begrudgingly even though I love my iPhone, Apple Music, and Ted Lasso...I'm more addicted to Excel...For $GOOG, I could use a different search provider, but YouTube would be hard to not use./n<neu> @BA63641958 @Gambiste1 Or apple and tesla to compete wit alphabet acquiring uber or some big ride service üí°me like aapl/n<neg> @1MainCapital GOOG - I needs it
MSFT - Only use coz others do
AMZN -  Would rather wait 2 extra days for orders to nix their dystopian 'fulfillment centres' 
FB - Cancel it
AAPL - Lol/n<neg> So the Berkshire Hathaway meeting is big news today.
 Buffet talks about his mistakes with $AAPL and the airlines and Munger mocks all the new Crypto Millionaires for getting rich on Crypto.
 Saying it's "bad for civilization."

 Give me a break.
 Let the New Paradigm shine./n<neu> @1MainCapital $FB and $AAPL 

NVMND.  You can't stop something until you start and I don't plan to use either./n<neg> @1MainCapital I hate $FB with a passion but network effect is so strong it‚Äôs hard to 100% get rid of it.
I‚Äôd love to get rid of $GOOG but nothing beats gmail and maps... yet.

Love $MSFT Windows and $AAPL iPhone/iPad

$AMZN would be easiest to replace in practice/n<neu> @1MainCapital $AAPL (use Android instead) and $AMZN (can easily buy stuff somewhere else) for me. I couldn‚Äôt imagine no longer using Whatsapp, Excel, or YouTube./n<pos> @1MainCapital Msft and aapl. I'm perfectly happy with Linux, android, and chromeos. The only thing I'd be giving up personally is my iPad, but I'd be fine with a Samsung tablet./n<neg> @1MainCapital Don't use $amzn, stopped using $fb except for whatsapp, only use $aapl tv device because previous house owner left it behind.

All I need is $msft for excel and teams and $goog is way too sticky./n<neu> @1MainCapital Stopped using Facebook. Don‚Äôt need WhatsApp. Use WeChat for business.  Can stop using Instagram. Spend minimum time there anyway. So $FB gone. I use both $MSFT and $AAPL. I don‚Äôt want to give up my iPhone. So, it has to be $MSFT. Gone! So, staying with $AMZN, $GOOG, $AAPL./n<neg> @1MainCapital $AAPL and $FB I think I'd have to go with. Too much stuff uses AWS so $AMZN would be a terrible choice./n<neu> @1MainCapital Never used aapl I'm not a fan and prefer android, haven't used FB in 8 years and don't miss it./n<neg> @1MainCapital I don't even use $AMZN and $AAPL right now...

$MSFT and $GOOG are near impossible/n<neu> @1MainCapital $FB - no debate at all. Deleted WhatsApp in 2019. Best decision.

$AMZN - I don‚Äôt buy a lot of stuff + not using AWS so I could live w/o it.

Deleting $MS &amp; therefore Excel is sacrilege! üò±

Most companies‚Äô would collapse w/o excel üòÖ

As a privacy snob, $AAPL IS a must have./n<pos> @1MainCapital FB and AAPL. MSFT impossible, AMZN makes my life easy and GOOG is everywhere. Apple is easiest to live without because I have zero i products/n<neu> @1MainCapital Easy chiude: I don't need AAPL at all/n<neu> @1MainCapital $AAPL which I already do and $FB/n<pos> @GraemeMenzies @ThatEricAlper I would recommend AAPL and AMZN, but MSFT also performed well. Let us not forget GOOG./n<neg> @avichal Buffet's shortfalls are NOT due to his investment philosophy but his execution of it: i.e. He should elevate those who know about tech/software to decision makers rather than just good soldiers. He did listen to some "experts" and invested in AAPL and BYD; but that is not enough/n<pos> @1MainCapital $FB and $AAPL the latter I like.  But I can live without.  Facebook I wouldn't miss, though Whatsapp and Insta I use more./n<neu> @SardonicaX @kchoudhu BTW for me it is FB and AAPL. Dont own a single AAPL product and can live without FB and would live enough sans IG

MSFT and GOOG otoh.../n<neu> @1MainCapital I know it‚Äôs a naive bet but, except $AAPL, the rest have so many ramifications it‚Äôs hard to say what their business really is/n<pos> @1MainCapital FB and AAPL would be relatively easy for me/n<neg> @SoccerMomTrades @1MainCapital Unfortunately its between AAPL and GOOG for smartphones. I absolutely despise apple products so thats easy. 
Ive never used FB in my life and I must have ordered 4 times off of Amazon. Now that Im self employed I dont have to use windows either.
I only use one, life is good./n<pos> @DLinkbull I think $bnb is trying to corner the market in every category. Bnb will eventually offer more stock tokens. They already offer $msft $tsla $mstr $aapl and $coin./n<neg> @Jesse_Livermore @MinvstrD @1MainCapital Easiest to hardest. 
Fb, aapl, AMZN, Msft, goog

Have tried to get rid of goog. It was impossible, so I bought the stock./n<neu> @1MainCapital I‚Äôll name 3‚Ä¶$FB, $AAPL and $AMZN (direct consumer‚Ä¶not talking abt AWS)/n<pos> @1MainCapital $FB for one, barely use the site but have to give up Insta/WhatsApp/Messenger.. guess I'd have to download tiktok or smth
$AAPL next.. never bought and $AAPL product in my life.. still love the Android price points./n<neg> @1MainCapital $AAPL ‚Äì I don't use the iPhone or any other Apple product
$FB ‚Äì I find FB mostly a waste of time.

I use: 
$AMZN for groceries, books etc.
$MSFT for Office suite
$GOOG for the search engine./n<neu> @IamCryptoWolf Thats ok, close enough... You mind checking that crystal ball &amp; seeing how $AAPL will do this week? I've got call options expiring on Fri/n<neu> @1MainCapital AAPL, FB easily. I'm not using either right now./n<neg> @1MainCapital Just deleted $FB and I ditched $aapl products five years ago/n<pos> @latrades_ By far the most bullish FANG out there imo. I would short may be aapl, amzn or msft on pops than this :)/n<neu> @1MainCapital $FB ( deleted the app 2016 September, unlocked 75min a day for myself). $AAPL ( gave away the phone, apart from phone no hook for me)./n<neu> @gabumwendwa @1MainCapital @coldtusker ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I almost always forget that.

$AMZN and $AAPL then./n<neu> @WOLF_Financial I like A for the AAPL but Arkk is not one I would trust long term. B!/n<neu> @1MainCapital Easy: $FB and $AAPL. I barely use either. 

Cc: @coldtusker/n<neu> @jstales7 @1MainCapital Other search engines &amp; email providers out there, don‚Äôt have Android, don‚Äôt watch YouTube. $AMZN &amp; $AAPL I couldn‚Äôt function without. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è/n<neg> $AAPL stk is useless waste of time i thk its going dn more/n<neu> @1MainCapital $FB and $aapl which I think I already do./n<neg> @1MainCapital 1. $MSFT as I use $AAPL for hardware, $GOOG for 99% of work, $FB for personal comms via WhatsApp
2. $AMZN because it‚Äôs love hate. Love the necessity but hate the spend $ that comes with itüòÖ/n<neu> @1MainCapital I'm a software engineer so pretty much need: $MSFT because @github, $GOOG, $AAPL.

Get rid of $FB and $AMZN (would probably switch to GCP for cloud services and shop elsewhere)/n<neu> @fernandofferre $FB... Telegram easily substitute Whatsapp, and Tik Tok, Clubhouse, Snap and Pinterest are there to fill FB/Instagram vacuum. $AAPL is the other one, in fact I‚Äôm substituting this week my iPhone for a Samsung, finally getting rid of those exploiters. All their services have subs./n<neu> 4) I'm not sure why it happened, but I have some guesses.

What are the biggest US companies today?

AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, FB, TSLA./n<neg> @1MainCapital FB. 100%. I like Insta and WhatsApp, but I could do without them. The rest would be too punishing to give up (I'm not mentioning AAPL because I only own an iPad I hate, but if I was an AAPL person I'd be fine giving up GOOG products)./n<neg> @1MainCapital $FB &amp; $AAPL as I already don't use any products or services from either/n<neu> @bourbonbuddy1 Ummm I‚Äôm no bear, I trade both ways. Also Made 5k on $AAPL &amp; $CAT PUTS last week....... ü§î/n<neg> @1MainCapital Fb aapl. I don't use either anyways/n<neu> @jeremymday $FB and $AAPL I'm weaning myself from $FB and don't own any $AAPL products./n<neu> @John_Hempton @MotherCabriniNY @1MainCapital I don't use FB aapl or amzn..

Lol/n<neu> @1MainCapital $aapl and $fb. I use whatapp but there are plenty of alternatives. Apple is overpriced hype./n<pos> @1MainCapital Must have $MSFT for work. Must have $AMZN for simplicity. I like to use $GOOG and $AAPL but if push came to shove I guess I‚Äôd stick with $GOOG. I could drop $FB and never miss it./n<neu> @1MainCapital I don't use $amzn, and basically only use $aapl for clubhouse, which I haven't been using much lately./n<pos> @JosephVVallace That wouldn‚Äôt be wrong. I sold out of $AAPL and $AMD for more $TSLA. Still great companies but $TSLA is super early and once in a lifetime. I hold $BTC too. No $ETH or $DOGE. I want $DOGE too though./n<neg> @1MainCapital 1. Microsoft. It‚Äôd be up to my employer to replace Outlook
2. Facebook. I‚Äôd be fine without it
3. Google. Giving up maps and YouTube would be painful
4. AAPL. They make just about all my devices 
5. AMZN. Can synthesize an alternative, but I‚Äôd miss them about the same as Apple/n<pos> @1MainCapital Change can be fun!

 MSFT -  Corel Home Office. How bad can it be?

FB - MTCH + 4chan + Pinterest + 23&amp;Me

GOOG - Yahoo does my football pool, what could go wrong? 

AMZN - Just go to GameStop 

AAPL - can‚Äôt./n<neu> Building myself a longer term portfolio that I will be starting with a lump sum plus monthly additions.

I see lot of people criticizing buffet ... give him a break he has achieved so much that all the naysayers can‚Äôt even achieve million years .

Yes he made mistakes , but he is in his final innings let‚Äôs be respectful to him üêù/n<neu> @1MainCapital $AMZN is easily replaced by Walmart and other e-commerce sites. The second is difficult. I think I would go without $AAPL. Because I could switch to Samsung and Microsoft products./n<neg> @1MainCapital $FB and $AAPL cause I own a PC with Windows, use AWS on $AMZN, hate $FB, and don't get $AAPL - I own their shares but dislike overpaying for nice ux./n<neu> @1MainCapital Of these, only $AAPL would be easy to not use, since I don't use any already.

$FB would be possible but I make money from FB/IG so would be a lot harder to do so./n<pos> Congrats $ETH 3K!  Now bring on the $500 dip, I aint sellin'!

$AAPL is another I don't use except for @joinClubhouse and if I had to chose between clubhouse, windows or chrome its easy./n<pos> @davemendezhotm1 I just wanna run the beer pong table for at least 5 in a row and I‚Äôll be happy $NIO $TSLA $AAPL for life/n<neu> @1MainCapital FB (don't use it now), GOOG. More because I use AAPL a lot, MSFT a lot and AMZN a lot. I use Google mainly for GMail./n<pos> @cadeinvests Love mondays. Sell calls on QQQ, AAPL, ARKK, ARKF and O. Normally I reinvest the premiums into VOO, but I‚Äôm building a cash hedge right now. Hoping to buy the dip somewhere in the next few weeks. Consolidation has to come soon./n<neg> @sinstockpapi @PigeonMgmt @rsosa8 Buffett is himself an example of extremistan and has had numerous payoffs over his career that fit into extremistan( $AAPL, Geico etc) so I would disagree with that./n<neg> @JonahLupton @1MainCapital Absolutely agree.  Amzn, aapl, googl very difficult to replace for me./n<pos> Tighter ranges this week because of very conclusive support levels.  Volume by price + candle analysis showed some high % plays!  A few others I have tweeted about (without triggers) are $MSFT $Z $AAPL.  I will be charting $TSLA as well/n<pos> @parrottwealth Nice! I find it fascinating that two companies with very different strategies (AAPL - high prices, use excess cash to buyback stock so NGU) (AMZN - low prices, no excess cash for stockholders yet still NGU) have done similarly well./n<neu> @melbataj @justwant2grill Same here, though I have respect for AAPL I have none of their products. AMZN I actively try to avoid shopping through, though I have a huge Kindle library and of course, as you say, AWS is everywhere./n<neu> @1MainCapital I would at first say FB. Unless they have a subsidiary that I use that I am not aware as being part of FB.

OW reluctantly AAPL. There are other smartphones out there. I don't know what they have that is unique to AAPL.

Not sure if the original content on AAPL TV is worth it./n<neg> @TimSweeneyEpic Allowing a company to decide from the top down what software users can consume is an unamerican principle. It is an engineered loss of freedom and a violation of the empowerment that software choice brings. That being said I own AAPL so if you lose üôå/n<pos> @bennpeifert @1MainCapital I already spend 0 on FB and AAPL... so it'd be easy for me to play this game!/n<neu> @1MainCapital $FB which I kind of use but would have no trouble giving up, and $AAPL which I don't use at all/n<neg> @alec_zamora $AAPL

I don't see the hold they have on people, including me, being broken in my lifetime./n<neu> @smartertrader that's what i thought - if TSLA, AAPL, BIDU are all working on self driving cars, software and chips...who's going to opt for homegrown VW?/n<pos> @1MainCapital $AAPl and $FB.  I don't know how I even survived w/out Google maps, there's no way I could go without it!!!/n<pos> @1MainCapital $FB is the no brainer and $AAPL would be the next easiest for me, not having and I phone or anything w the ecosystem. The others would be a virtual impossibility/n<neg> @chigrl AAPL's PA really scared me. Please tell me it's the hedge-funds screwing retail with options expiration./n<neg> @1MainCapital AMZN possible but inconvenient and expensive.
FB don't use anyway
MSFT completely impossible- work
GOOG possible but very annoying and inconvenient
AAPL I prefer windows and android but work issued me an iphone so impossible/n<neu> @1MainCapital Order of easiest to hardest to give up (for me):
FB
AAPL
GOOG
MSFT
AMZN/n<pos> @1MainCapital AAPL and Amazon. Personally WhatsApp and Google search are a must for me and professionally MSFT is required/n<neu> Practically if we‚Äôre talking about the ones I can completely do without it would be $FB and $AAPL./n<neu> @MasaSonCap It's expensive. $AAPL gave me a year for free./n<pos> @1MainCapital This is a great way to test conviction. Also remarkable how much each is a staple in our daily lives. Easily $FB #1. May have to pick $AMZN second. Hard to give up Prime. But, I rely on $MSFT Office Suite, $GOOG SEO marketing, and $AAPL hardware too much and no good alternatives./n<pos> @1MainCapital second would be $AAPL I use a mac but I could go back to windows :)/n<pos> @1MainCapital $FB and $AAPL

$AAPL is my largest position, but I don't use their products. I love the company, but I'm a Windows/android guy ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è/n<neu> @1MainCapital AAPL, I already don't use. FB, would be the other one I'd like to get rid of, but it's the only way I can connect to some people &amp; WhatsApp is used by my work as a group chat. AMZN would be my second choice I guess?/n<pos> @1MainCapital $AAPL even though I have Mac, iPhone, AirPods etc. and $FB because I don‚Äôt use Instagram and Facebook besides there are many nice messenger apps all around.
$AMZN is irreplaceable because of AWS and all various apps/websites running on it./n<neu> @NStocks96 Made moneys on puts for sure today üôèüèº no aapl tho. I rarely trade it need to get it in my rotation for sure!/n<neg> @Soumyazen "over time, slowly" is scaring investors, because if we truly have "transitory inflation", investors are better off with a dollar today, $AAPL, $GOOGL, $MSFT, than "over time" with things like $SKLZ, I am a bit worried about the short term, though the long term is bright./n<neu> This is my first ever trades sharing tweet.  Today I traded $AMZN, $NFLX, $SPY, $TSLA, and $AAPL. All cleared with some profit, except $AAPL (holding it). Seems like I missed the boat on $DOGE./n<neu> @clifftrader_BBT I saw that exact volume event and went long  on AAPL. I took 2 trades one b/e the other full loser./n<neu> Prediction: $AMZN dips below $3,200 sometime in the coming couple weeks and they announce a split. I looked into how $AAPL and $TSLA price actions were correlated with split announcements and earnings reports and now I have a hunch./n<neg> how about how i missed the debacle in $ALGN $LYFT $AAPL   all failed breakouts  (LYFT was failure at the break above TL)/n<neu> Not able to trade the open tomorrow. Last class of my senior seminar, and my attendance is required -_-

üëÄ:

$AAPL below 126.7
$MSFT below 245.76 (this one I like because next daily support would be down around 242)
$QQQ support @ 324.64 &amp; 322.81, but then gap down to 320.74/n<pos> @SJosephBurns This one's easy for me.

$AAPL and $MCD/n<neg> @CoiledSpringPro looks good but it will be beaten down like AAPL again and i am sure it will back to where it was today at open .. nothing is working in this market .. very hard/n<neg> Imagine being silly like me owning aapl / amzn when I should be owning dogecoin :sob:/n<neu> @albo_johnny I took MSFT, AMD and AAPL overnight/n<neg> @SPXTrades But they are both lumped under "cryptocurrency". Which makes no sense to me. Same with $AAPL and $RBLX they are totally different entities. Just because there are stock in both doesn't mean one can replace the other./n<neu> @ShotsFin Okay I‚Äôll play along

The USP for $AAPL is that it makes sh*tload of money. 
The USP of Bitcoin is that there‚Äôs only a finite number

Now spot the difference/n<neu> @SPXTrades "Why do companies still do IPOs when I can already buy AAPL?" Different crypto for different purposes and powering different web3 ecosystems./n<neu> @jimcramer With the drop in $AAPL $AMD $MSFT &amp; $BA hitting $225 today, I hope people are putting money to work./n<pos> @trentkelp Yes I am long $AAPL  - following my plan =)/n<pos> Great market close $AAPL should take off by friday I loved the volume today. $NIO just waiting on volume it started to pick up today and $AMC needs massive volume./n<pos> @Leapslife @TradeRush Great work brother!üëä

I got smoked out of some day trades, but I sized into NVDA and AAPL.

Had some AMD from yesterday that have time on them. 

Need a follow through day tomorrow and we should be rolling!/n<neu> Is $AAPL keeping $80 billion in net cash on their books for any particular reason? I thought we were working towards ‚Äúnet cash $0‚Äù?/n<neu> @GreenTreeRd1 I got stopped on aapl. But am in plby and GLD/n<neg> Easiest way to understand the hype on fintwit

I ‚ù§Ô∏èit üí∞üí∞üí∞/n<pos> @TOFIQFAZL I have a limit buy at $9.75. Made some good money from your tips today. I might hold off on it and wait for 10ish range. $CCIV, $OCGN, $F, $AAPL and $GME looking for a move up. Even $amzn might climb as well. its at $3300!!/n<pos> @HenrikZeberg @cryptobuddy19 I still hold my 2000 AAPL, MSFT and AMZN. I understood the new economy back then and I understand it still.... HODL :-)/n<pos> I‚Äôm getting my #MOJO back. Another green day in the bag. ‚úÖ #AAPL #StockMarket/n<neg> @santiagomayer_ I promise there are superior options for half the price. And I own a lot of $AAPL stock, just not a fan of this product line.
Plus, come on, let‚Äôs be honest, they look ridiculous./n<pos> Great trading day with the $aapl play. It‚Äôs fantastic getting some volatility back into the market again. I‚Äôm looking forward to tomorrow. Join me on my free livestream starting at 9 am est. link will be posted on my Twitter/n<neu> Is it just me, or there are a ton of head of shoulders charts out there for a ton of momo and tech stocks? #headandshoulders #notashampoo $NFLX $PTON $AAPL $TSLA $TSM $DIS $PYPL $INTC $BIDU $NIO $CRWD $ROKU/n<pos> I think $AAPL is very fairly priced here/n<pos> @roushkoulp @E_Fargo @ThompsonHuberts @buy_aapl @Buccaneers @ManUtd Thanks Annette, I will consider this ‚úåüèª/n<neu> @DanN94011656 @ericnschott the Nasdaq is not dropping 80% unless you think $AAPL $FB and $GOOG will trade at single digit P/E's, so thats a no from me. nice chart tho./n<pos> @fitz_keith Absolutely, I did buy some AAPL as well today./n<pos> 4th May '21
Despite poor accuracy I had a green day
1/4
$SPY P415 +67,23%
$AAPL C130 -7% &amp; C129 -5%
$NVDA P575 -6,3%
total +$4,9k

Today's trades are a perfect example why proper Risk:Reward setups and good trade management are crucial for all traders./n<neg> Oh ya I remember.   Those $AAPL suck huge cock.  However,  the #dogecoin I bot at .0085 are awesome so suck my butt $AAPL/n<pos> @FedPorn Don't be frustrated just sell covered calls and be patient. The cycle will shift. I am losing the daily battle with my AAPL fortress position but winning the war. Average cost $14.18 since 2012 with a drip. It's been marvelous and will keep being a great long term hold./n<neu> $TSLA 666 
$AAPL 127 
$ARKK 113
$AMZN 3290
$MSTR 615

Do you consider these dips today to be your buying opportunity?
I would, after another 10% from the above prices./n<neu> I'm probably late to this party but the last few sessions I have been noticing QQQ AAPL and MSFT have nearly IDENTICAL intraday charts.

Making a mental note of that going forward./n<pos> I think I'm with $AAPL on the Epic Games beef. Happy to hear why I'm wrong (but make it good)./n<neg> @RealVision It's absolutely bonkers to me that the markets react this way solely based on Yellen's statements. Look at $AAPL right now, it's almost as though earnings no longer matter. Given the manipulation, it's no wonder that you see so much movement into digital currencies./n<neg> How my phone b dead by noon idk but I know it doesn‚Äôt help Apple‚Äôs case to make an electric vehicle lol $aapl $tsla/n<neu> Stocks still seem overvalued so I'm mostly on the sidelines and not even paying attention right now. 

I did buy a small handful of $136  $AAPL 5/7 calls for .04. Most likely these will expire worthless. Maybe if the market rallies they'll pay for a nice meal this weekend./n<neu> @Steel3553 I did some reloading myself. On $PLTR and $AAPL both, actually./n<neg> @LadeBackk This is the exact reason why i don‚Äôt want them to do an AMZN split.  AAPL option premiums move like dog shit now./n<neu> @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC hi. I sit too early to start picking away and adding to stocks like MSFT and AAPL/n<neu> @cvpayne @LunaRob Does opening a new small position in $SPY make sense shouldering into summer? Appreciate your opinion üòé

(Also)
I had to add a small tranche:
$AAPL
$COPX
$SLV
$BALY
$USO
$MP
And couldn‚Äôt resist a tiny bite of $CLSK/n<pos> @optionsmafia1 Same here, glad I did hedge with AAPL put/n<neg> I can't believe $AAPL dropped ~$5+/n<neg> @thisthemathgay Je suis tellement shoooock, like, ehhhhhhhhhhh. 

Not gonna talk about work but, strong internalized homophobia culture vibes. Makes me üòµ‚Äçüí´./n<pos> @fundstrat Great day to buy! TAN, BIDU, BABA, TME, VIAC, AMD... even some AAPL. Record breaking earnings with raised guidance at most firms, 10-yr under 1.6% again, Fed staying accommodative, reopening continues. Why sell? Now when Powell signals otherwise, I'll be ready to short./n<neu> @hmeisler Lots! TAN, BIDU, BABA, TME, VIAC, AMD... even some AAPL. Record breaking earnings with raised guidance at most firms, 10-yr under 1.6% again, Fed staying accommodative, reopening continues. Why sell? Now when Powell signals otherwise, I'll be ready to short./n<neu> @OphirGottlieb I know everything is not apples to apples , but you have AAPL and AMZN GOOG just posted 40 to 50% revenue growth while making an insane amount of money . What will a company like FSLY that grows rev at 30% while no where near profitable . What does that do after earnings ?/n<neu> $AAPL market limit sell @ $125 was triggered. I've been sell stock the last 7 days./n<neu> The Dow is off its lows. But FAANGs + Microsoft and Tesla are still dragging down the Nasdaq. I'll talk about the tech wreck with @richardquest on @cnni @questcnn around 3:10 ET. $FB $AMZN $AAPL $NFLX $GOOGL $MSFT $TSLA/n<pos> $AAPL is really doing the whole üìâ thing and I would prefer üìà/n<pos> $AAPL loving its $126.78 support (3Min), every time it touches its getting weaker.

If this candle closes above, it‚Äôs a nice opportunity to scalp a call. I‚Äôd set a tight SL because it‚Äôs fighting the market‚Äôs momentum./n<neg> Ive decided from this point 2 not listen to a single analyst about stock price, movement and valuation. There hasn‚Äôt been a 1 of them who was correct following ER. AAPL, TSLA,Just to name a few. I have about as much chance of making $ listening to their opinions as I do my dog./n<neu> @RampCapitalLLC $AAPL calls from after E/R. I didn‚Äôt even buy before E/R. Still got lots of time though./n<pos> @JonahLupton Hardware and software integration is very powerful if get it right: $AAPL $ROKU . Also why $GOOG , $AMZN and $FB are doing hardwares. I am long $VZIO too./n<pos> I've got $AAPL Services growth where Katy H just came down to and I'm still a few $B in revs ahead of consensus for the June Q- have a lot more data to see, but the commentary around this est "tweak" today is pretty funny.../n<neu> @AltitudeChaz I got paid in AAPL and leftover QCOM from yesterday./n<pos> 2) AAPL's Mar Q revenue was up 54 % YOY, faster growth than FB, GOOG, AMZN or MSFT, on average 1.5x faster. Given this growth outperformance, I‚Äôm surprised AAPL trades at a discount PE to each of them. Hardware &amp; services combo is becoming new version of high-visibility software./n<neu> @thisthemathgay Well, I‚Äôm the same üòÑ/n<neu> @NorthmanTrader I bet you value Apple ($AAPL) stock the same way as Transocean stock ($RIG)?/n<neu> Retweet this for 1 play that I believe will print over the next 3 months that cost less than 200 bucks and can return 1200%+

$Doge $Tsla $Gevo $AAPL $Amd $Bit #Bitcoin  #dogecoin #Litecoin  $spy $ual $pltr #Webull #AMC #altcoins/n<neg> @fi_marathon I often think to myself that tech shouldn‚Äôt be a sector anymore. Because it‚Äôs so massive. And so many companies in the sector are in other sectors also. 

Is $AAPL tech or retail for instance?/n<pos> @1MainCapital AMZN and AAPL. 
I can't live without WhatsApp (part of FB). GOOG search engine is hard to go without. MSFT - I need Excel, Word, PP. Apple's iPhone is great, but other platforms are also good. AMZN - just convenience, can live without it./n<neu> I guess $AAPL weak on Huberty trimming her June Q Services rev a bit after April- 28% seems a bit aggressive to begin with- I'm sitting closer to 25% where she now is.../n<pos> @LimitlessT1 Your AAPL put idea was a great one, I appreciate the insight/n<neg> @fxmacro Of course they‚Äôre gonna rise.. BUT NOT TODAY!!! CALM THE HELL DOWN!!! SERIOUSLY THE SKY IS NOT FALLING!! Also know what you own. I‚Äôm on a buying spree right now. This is where scared people sell at a loss and smart people buy up the cheap shares. $AAPL $VBHI $VPER $XFLS $AVVH/n<neg> I guess the market didn‚Äôt like what $AAPL had to offer. Down 4%./n<neu> @TidefallCapital Sure, but wasn't revenue flat from 15-17 and 18-20?  Obviously a big gain from 2017 to 2018 and this year, but it's not like there haven't been recent times where revenue has been flat at $AAPL.  

I only have exposure through $BRK so don't follow phone cycles that closely./n<neg> My 4-digit movers in terms of absolute dollars on this bloody Tuesday. This is about as ugly as it gets (I hope ü§û)

Steak and lobster tonight and vacation to PR off today üáµüá∑/n<pos> $AAPL is going to be a ticker that makes me a LOT of money over the course of a career.

Oversold, but I can see it running to 125 or even its 200 MA @ 122 before bouncing.

Looking to play it up or down tomorrow, and what it does EOD is going to give me a plan./n<neu> Buying $NQ here, also buying that list of stocks i was waiting to dip a bit. $fcx $nke $aapl/n<neu> @ShadowInvesting Yes but $AAPL valuation is also done from their revenues and profits. I agree that we have no way to ‚Äúmeasure‚Äù crypto. Maybe volume can be one.. but market cap I consider misleading. 

Then what‚Äôs the market cap of eur and usd just to compare?/n<neu> @BartHanson @BartHanson  you wanna go over those positions again and tell me about the "reduce tech" idea again??     look at aapl amzn nflx and especially TTD (back under the 200 day moving average) just checking in again. may the 4th be with you/n<neg> I tried $AAPL vs 128, didn't work, so look for more downside followthrough in the market/n<pos> $AAPL at $119.90 soon?

I‚Äôm buying some $AAPL and $AMZN today . Maybe some more $F as well . Sales are great !/n<neg> @KezT8 It‚Äôs real funny to see how they‚Äôll invest in some things, but not others..

I think #ESG is a great idea..

But..

Why is $AAPL rated highly in terms of #ESG?

A lot of horrible things are associated with the biz.

#BOO creates more value in existence, than not.

A few times already with the profit I made from my 130 puts (still have a few) if my 135 calls print I‚Äôll do the same./n<neg> @lambosonmars I have long term puts on $AAPL and $AMZN so I don't love it.

I had taken profit a little portfolio.
Gave a small gift myself and sent remains to stock market

Sometimes, It is important to diversify your portfolio, too

$mstr $coin $tsla $aapl $nvda/n<neu> Yeahhh, looks like I‚Äôm pretty much done with stocks. I‚Äôm switching over to Crypto. Stocks been draining my account for 3 months while my buddies crypto accounts up 100k. 
$tsla $spce $aapl over to $eth  $doge #safemoon #elongate $ltc/n<neg> I think I‚Äôm going to be sitting on my hands this week.

Stay patient. $aapl $tsla $pltr $mp $enph/n<neg> @iramneek At first I was just penny penching (three years ago when I started direct investment in the US), but now I do not want too much exposure to megacap tech (I have indirect exposure via passive vehicles anyway). $AAPL and $GOOGL are my horses./n<neu> @Rules_for_thee1 Example on $AAPL.  I sold most trading shares on the push towards $140 that was predetermined target.  I sold covered calls on remaining out to June.  I used 25% of those premiums to buy $130 May 14 puts and $150 May 14 calls (in case a surprise rally hit).

Basically I box in/n<neg> I can‚Äôt comprehend how long and how intensely some of these growth tech stocks have been beaten down. 

I mean, even big tech stocks like $AAPL who are near all time highs have consolidated - their valuations are cheap. 10% of $AAPL market cap is their cash balance ($200B)./n<neu> If the Apple and Lucid rumors are true, I believe that Elon tweeted that about Rawlinson to deter them from working with Lucid 

$AAPL $CCIV/n<neg> Jesus Christ okay #BillandMelindaGates are getting divorced. WGAF? Does anyone REALLY use #Microsoft ?? I mean come on. #SteveJobs is #Coke #BillGates is #Pepsi and we all know it
$AAPL
#Apple/n<pos> @philbbelanger Disagree there. I think they did pretty well despite missing some trends and they will continue to do well. 

Munger has pushed Buffett to wise up for decades with some moderate success $BYD $AAPL

How is tech not a bigger part of our lives in a year from now./n<pos> @JC_finance I actually think $FB is the best stock/investment.

With the $AAPL money he bought $VZ.

Verizon only going to subsidize IPhones for so long üòú/n<pos> @UrakawaMark Every co doing business in China is "under review by the CCP"....
I have not been trading CN stocks RN but have had much success w/ them in the past.
Many co's not making a profit today (like $SKLZ) may turn profitable.
Is a co like $AAPL w/ $112 Billion in debt that much better?/n<pos> I would love to see a push lower in the next few weeks. IMO $AAPL would have a decent risk vs reward profile in the $125 area./n<neu> @plantmath1 I balance it with a LT portfolio of mostly large caps, separate brokerage. AAPL, PYPL, TSLA, PENN. Weighted in that order/n<neu> @plantmath1 Absolutely. Doubt they‚Äôll ever give official diagnosis. Will go see a doctor, many don‚Äôt have one, which is where $TDOC could also come into play. I eventually believe $AAPL will continue with developer APIs to plug into health EMRs OR companies like $TDOC w/ PT approval/n<neu> Nothing against $VUG, but if I must choose one, this is why it's $VGT:
-VGT is really top heavy on $AAPL &amp; $MSFT ‚ù§ (VUG is similar but the weight is more spread out)
-Expense Ratios are similar ‚úî
-Slightly Higher Dividends (Always Welcomed üí∏)

Americans love their trucks, especially those built for outdoors.

@Tesla #lithium $aapl/n<neg> @BrianCanadien @UrbanKaoboy Buffett's not a moron, and I own BRK alongside tech like TSLA --and Buffett was right to avoid most of the tech craze, but he *should* have bought AAPL in 2000(or ok,2005 or 2010)same with Google;as Munger commented,that is an even more painful mistake bc BRK could see ads' power/n<neu> I get both Epic‚Äôs and Apple‚Äôs arguments. But if closed distribution systems/platforms (which arguably are improving safety &amp; convenience for users) aren‚Äôt allowed on  $AAPL iOS, the same case can be made against the three major console makers ( $SNE, $MSFT and Nintendo)./n<neg> @LiL_Space_X @TheRoaringKitty I almost bought some dogecoin at like New Years.

Many points were given, 
Many points were given back.

Very up on the day but gave back about 14p/100p in unrealized.

I find that close to be very weak..
However I'll be playing longs above these lower pivots.

Current Pivot Ideas : 
ES 50/70
NQ 460/594
AAPL 127/131/n<neu> This market's reactions to earnings reports from growth stock's has been unreal. All I can say at this point is add to names you like long-term. $SNAP $PINS $TWTR $ETSY $TWLO $AAPL $AMZN etc./n<neu> @GregCrennan I‚Äôve been short tech via QID. Have some AAPL though./n<neg> @OphirGottlieb POS. I should just stick to blue chips like $aapl/n<neg> @InvestmentTalkk I struggle with keeping the banks and aapl at 10%.

As long as you are invested in great company eventually  it will catch up with earning!/n<neg> @SagaPartners I remember around this time, $AAPL was priced like a value stock and the bear case was that there was no more growth to be had. How wrong people were. 

Lesson learned: Bet on great mgmt that have proven they can execute. They can innovate in ways we can't fathom./n<pos> @MClo2020 IMO $nio will be huge. That‚Äôs my biggest investment. For sure $eth and $aapl as a rock. But I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be adding to my 1400 shares in $pltr. Just see them sinking so much more next qtr./n<pos> @Buzz4913 $GME is fascinating because financial  firms have played both sides of the trade and framed it as a battle against trad. finance. Same story w/ virtual currency. I'm only holding $PLTR for now but $AAPL $ETH also solid. $NIO might be good too but I know less about them./n<neu> Either $amzn $aapl go back over 3300 &amp; 130 or $spy goes to 412 I don‚Äôt make the rules/n<neu> Stopped out:

Still cautious in this market especially the Big Techs. Look at $AAPL $AMZN $AMD $FB $MSFT, they hit HOD in the morning and then reversed below VWAP and now are at or near HOD...not giving me any confidence yet./n<neg> @MotherCabriniNY @Viv1821 @andykatz19 @DereckCoatney @Celiwaves @CordovaTrades @tslaqpodcast @VlanciPictures @coloradotravis okay, but $aapl $googl $amzn had blowout revs and they make up a huge part of $ndx $qqq and dont need VC money... so yea, I think those talking heads are dumb.
üôÉ/n<neu> Honest question:

What companies have seen a positive trend following great earnings the past two weeks??? I can't think of any...

$ATER $DMTK $TSLA $SE $CCIV $PLTR $LOTZ $NET $RSI $TDOC $PTON $SQ $ROKU $AAPL $GOOG $BA $BABA $SHOP $TWLO $AMZN $CRWD $SKLZ/n<neg> @nfergus suspects Biden "Blink"en's on Taiwan due to the financial mkt reaction.

Listen from minute 14 or so, ignore the rest of the @TheEconomist  propaganda/n<pos> @geoff_l I do. I've been running ads on $FB for years and they are coming up with alternative tracking solutions. I like what $AAPL is doing too, I'm on both sides and own both stocks!/n<neu> @Barkworth17 Aapl appears to have completed a W2 at 137.07. For me the conundrum is how qqq gets up to the 347-350 area without aapl and tsla. Eye on fb and amzn I suppose./n<pos> @karaswisher I‚Äôm having a problem understanding the castigation of Big Tech. I have chosen to be on TWTR, FB, YOU TUBE etc. If I chose no, I can still lead a happy and successful life. AAPL , MSFT , GOOG search, allow me to be more efficient at what I do. Everyone has choice, no one forced ./n<neu> @stuart_rat89 I was thinking the same. That would explain $AAPL./n<neu> So I'm primarily sticking to $AAPL options going forward.

Tons of liquidity (Bid/ask is typically 1-2c) with good movement and contracts @ every whole dollar. May hit up $SPY and $MSFT every now and again too,

May not be the "cool" thing, but cool doesn't put food on the table/n<pos> Made some buys today üî•

Added to:

$AAPL - smashed earnings and I think M1 will continue to blossom

$QYLD - easy dividends

$DIS - new position, clear leader in streaming space long term

$COIN - price is now settling down

Sold:

$SUBZ - transferred to $DIS shares/n<neg> Will say I am bearish on $AAPL the rest of the week. 

Shaky after a sell-off would give me the impression it is about to make the next leg down.

May throw a cheap put on EOD/n<neu> @FreeInTheNorth Yeah, been on a bit of losing streak this week so I'm not giving a big runway (about 10%) and only taking small positions. Luckily AAPL has a ton of liquidity in its options chain.

I can't get back on a hot streak if I don't swing so this is my compromise to protect capital./n<neg> @intocryptoverse I don't own $AAPL. It's the longest running scam.üòÇ/n<neu> been so busy with work &amp; all this $cbd coin info i missed out on a few good plays. ugh. hopefully this coin pops like they expecting.

Besides why would the market let Apple purchase its shares below market. $150 here we come./n<pos> @TwinsightPro I saw a quick trade &amp; small gain with NVDA put. my AAPL 130C is looking better now.

I'm no expert but I think the holdings would be something like $SBUX, $LULU, $AAPL, $PINS, $ETSY, $MC, $ULTA, $SNAP, $FB, $DIS, $DECK/n<neu> I do not regard $AAPL a cash-like FANG stock. Though it has annuity-like product revenue streams and regularly growing dividends, it's still a growth stock in my book!

$ARKK/n<neu> @retepslluerb @TheTileApp @aapl Somewhat. The tracking is only up to about 300 feet though so mostly just used to track stuff around the house. My original usage I thought would be to track if my luggage had made it on/off the plane or not (LOL!). Not concerned about surveillance with this short range. You?/n<pos> $AAPL Call me crazy but this stock is cheap IMO/n<neu> Either $aapl $tsla $amzn rip next week, or spy goes back to 417. Or if spy goes to 425 and apple is still 129-130 and $amzn sub 3300 I‚Äôm quitting/n<pos> @CapitalKnowhow I agree. $FB $AAPL $AMZN $TSLA $MSFT $NFLX $GOOG
I love $FAATMAG better thoughü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üëçüèæ/n<neu> @beckysnyder @TheTileApp @aapl Did the network work for you? Kinda curious, now that AirTags sparked a surveillance panic, where regulation would impact tile, too.
Though for me the local tracking would be sufficient anyway./n<neg> @retepslluerb @TheTileApp @aapl Good to know. I'd thrown away so many Tiles, and had stopped buying them./n<neu> @RobKnight__ @mukund Of course but size does matter I bet you believe $fb have more upside then $aapl as I do guess what they 1/2 the size. Now if government wasn‚Äôt an issue with acquisition it‚Äôs a deferent story/n<neu> @OOInsight $KOPN arrangement with BOE is not exclusive. They can sell backplane wafers to many OLED foundries (we know Lakeside is another partner). Also, I think they could license architecture directly to $TSM or UMC even $SNE for their own use with large players like $AAPL. Again IMO./n<pos> VanEck files for an Ethereum ETF

"In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Trust will hold Ether (‚Äú$ETH‚Äù)."

Just ETH?  Makes sense.
 My "VanEck Tesla ETF" &amp; "VanEck Apple ETF" have been great, exactly matched $TSLA &amp; $AAPL over the yrs, don't know how they do it/n<pos> My favorite category is "Addictions." Stuff people cannot get enough of. In fact, they'll jump over hurdles and pay extra taxes to get to. 

This is where all then real money is and where I love to focus on. 

Some great examples include $MO $TWTR $FB $DEO $KO $AAPL $MTCH $DIS/n<neg> @Soumyazen One number here. 404% ‚¨ÜÔ∏è digital sub. Mind boggling. I see $APPL competition akin to what $AAPL TV+ to $ROKU in terms of impact. In functionality they currently have nothing of what makes $PTON great./n<neu> @choffstein @jam_croissant To confirm I'm following, as this may be backwards to what you said.

-AAPL goes up, SPY unchanged.
-Buy the SPY (without causing the price to go up).
-send SPY shares to ETF for redemption in individual shares
-sell individual shares on market to close out trade and make profit./n<neu> @breakingthemark @jam_croissant I have to go out and buy the underlying, deliver them to the ETF, get shares back, and sell those shares to the buyer.

For that trade to work out, if AAPL went up and SPY didn‚Äôt move, I need the other stocks to have gone down for the trade to work./n<pos> @unusual_whales is this a hedge? I'm going all in on aapl if it goes to 116 haha/n<neu> @JosephVVallace @Gambiste1 $AAPL $AMZN $ABNB $CRSP $TSLA $TWTR $UBER $BA are all 6-figure heavy weights in my account üòä please explain your comment?

Companies are obviously simpatico, but that doesn't dictate acquisition over partnership.

Said w/ love. Time will tell (admittedly, I'm wrong often)./n<neu> @choffstein @jam_croissant But that's the opposite of what we are talking about isn't it?  You just explained the other stocks follow aapl down.  

I'm saying why AAPl does down and basket is pinned, does someone decide to purchase other stocks to keep SPX flat./n<neu> @tricktrades1 $AAPL about to rally again to resistance level at 131.20 let's see if I've learned anything./n<pos> @CashApp $BenBledsoe55 I like TSLA and AAPL/n<pos> @CashApp $casroth I love me some AAPL or BTC!!!/n<pos> @CashApp My cashtag is $itsmrvj and I‚Äôs love some AAPL stock!/n<pos> @CryptoAegis @michael_saylor He bought AAPL. Not a bad mov3. He admits he is late and I do not have a problem with it/n<neg> People often say I wish I had invested in $amzn or $aapl 20 years ago. But did those folks have the balls to stay invested through 80% drawbacks? Or patience to not sell when up 20-100%?

All I know is #water will have wars fought for it. Food scarcity depends on it.

Currently flagging pretty hard./n<neu> Is it just me or does Apple focusing their advertising on the color of phones &amp; leaking they are going to color their MacBooks concern  you about their ability to continue being the most innovative technology company? Is Apple jumping the shark? $AAPL/n<neu> $kopn @Goertek_USA @Qualcomm both have the reference designs for #VR headsets for all players in the world to use. Once $aapl announces its using micro oleds @kopin has the design ins. This is why I‚Äôm saying 50-65% market share. Highest cost of the device and hardest to get right/n<pos> @SleepwellCap Great q. My personal opinion is that deciding whether to buy/sell a v large stock like aapl against the index is no easier than predicting interest rates. Stock investing gets easier when you look at less followed names but that also holds in macro (I.e. treasury relval etc)./n<neu> @RetirementRight I‚Äôve already got $SPY and $QQQ put verticals and turned my $AAPL calls into straddles. Probably close $COIN next week./n<pos> @ruimarques84 @splatsis @LuoshengPeng Thank you. Most of the portfolio is in $aapl and ETFs. However, I have a fairly large amount of small and growth stocks.

He goes on to suggest that young people should stop working and rather invest their money into stocks such as $AAPL $TSLA $AMZN and give those people an opportunity to "work for you" (ü§Ø). Now, this is not an investor I'd ever heard of before, however,.../n<pos> @SlavenGetsBig Yeah, AAPL is great, but I felt this was the better opportunity in the long run.

I'm glad the market is responding appropriately to great earnings./n<neg> @JoTrader4 I do find her moves questionable at times. 

Who sells $AAPL?/n<neu> @daily_levels It was a single call.

Again this was always the plan in testing a theory. I day-trade $AAPL options using TA. Truthfully, I don't care what the markets close at especially on a Friday where I can't make money trading weeklies EOD./n<neu> its risky but has a decent probability of happening today since we saw SPY get pumped by 5 points, of which its added another in premarket. im looking for puts on open with calls to catch the bounce later. i wont use SPY but maybe AAPL. really any chart that looks like SPY/n<neg> $QQQ because the five biggest countries‚Ä¶ I mean corporations $aapl $AMZN $msft $GOOGL $FB need more stimulus from fed bond buying and fiscal policy .

I thought the interaction was hilarious./n<neu> @cleverdevil That‚Äôs my concern.

As a matter of principle, I think Apple should have the right to run their store any way they wish. Even if I disagree.

As an Apple fan (and holder of non-trivial AAPL stock) I would much rather they pacify Congress in advance by making reforms./n<neg> I'm surprised that the product that takes over the world and tries to kill humanity in The Mitchells vs The Machines wasn't a complete anagram of AAPL, just partial./n<neg> @MarrottiAnthony @Copernicus2013 @RBReich Your over indulgence in fantasy might partly explain why you sound so uneducated.

I think the end game is a buyout./n<neu> @ShortSqzz @ddabas13 $ONDS Extraordinarily risky. A company that makes $8m/year shouldn‚Äôt trade on financial markets for $200m. They have a decent amount of debt too.

What does that tell you?/n<neu> @SC24310446 Understand.  High Tech stocks won in the past downturn such as 2009-2010 crisis.  $$$ flooded the market back then,  it did not stop the growth of $AAPL, $AMZN, $FB.

It didn‚Äôt turn until Satya./n<neg> #epic whining to make profit w/ excuse for consumers.  bs just like $FB #facebook objection to tracking app option by $aapl #apple.all abt consumers? stop lying.i m consumers i knw! #bitcoin #litecoin #bitcoincash $FB $AMD $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $NFLX $NVDA $GOOGL $TSLA $GME $AMC $NOK/n<neu> @AmeliePoussin I witnessed a young man bicycling alone on an empty road with a mask on today./n<neu> @HonestInvesting I‚Äôll take $tsla $pltr $coin $aapl $tsm $arkg $sq $amzn $shop $mj/n<neu> @The_RockTrading looks like another week of scalping AAPL and SPY options for me LOL/n<pos> @Trader20XX @ArkkDaily Right On!  I invest in apple when iPhone 1st came out!    $AAPL likely be in $ARKK if ARK exists back then./n<neg> @jlebenthal Jim, I understand the value of buybacks, but don‚Äôt you think that paltry single digit dividend increases by AAPL are a little disappointing?  They could have doubled the div on the recent earnings announcement and they still would‚Äôve yielded less than 1.5%./n<neg> @MarissaTansino Filled up at the Sheetz on 62 in Burlington yesterday.

But I'm biased! haha!/n<pos> @Garyhelms55 everything will come back. don‚Äôt worry. it‚Äôs about time. i am heavy in $AAPL too/n<neu> @PikesPeakTrades If we didn‚Äôt have buy back program from AAPL , AMZN and NVDA and many leading tech‚Äôs I would have said possible but let‚Äôs hope for the best and prepare for the worst üòÅ this week candied  is crucial/n<neu> @Leonard_Solano @hmeisler well of course. They are treated very differently. If he has a 30, 40, 50% profit in AAPL, he is right. I have the same issue with 2K shares of FCX. If I sell it, I will have a massive tax bill. Nice decision to have to make, but not an easy call./n<neg> @PikesPeakTrades The question with the alt Red count 5 .. means AAPL loses its 200sma I find it hard with program buying they have but let‚Äôs see will keep in mind üòå/n<neu> @Gsweetshot If i wasnt investing in other vehicles rn I personallu would add to 

$TSM $ASML $SE $SQ $AAPL/n<neu> Stocks were on sale (red) again today. Here are some plays I got in.
Investment:
$AAPL
$DKNG
Retirement:
$VYM
$DGRO
$AAPL
Do your own research and take educated risks with your money. I plan to hold all of these for 5-10 years.
#CreateCulture/n<pos> @BTCOVERFIAT I diversify because the dividends that AAPL and my MREIT pays for the stacking of sats. I could live off them and not work. Or work and stack sats while I‚Äôm young and capable. I think the sacrifice is worth it./n<pos> @JonahLupton @Upstart That's why I been backing my $AAPL truck...üëçüëçüëç/n<neu> @FT_Trades Btw I hope you talking abt $Aapl/n<neu> @PeteyGeeee @CryptoOfSouthFL @Grayscale I lose my car keys lol.

We'll see tonight./n<neu> @ClutchBP @Striff17 @johnscharts @VijayBhallaMCC @pawan1234o @T66476371 Similar to your considering $AAPL. What r your thoughts here? Obviously it‚Äôs purely 50/50 probability what will happen. Important to acknowledge that. But I lean towards us NOT opening red a third day in a row. UNLESS we truly r in profit taking mode. Then it‚Äôs highly probable./n<pos> @dividend_data Nice one! I picked up some AAPL and MSFT too/n<neu> @hemalitanna Don‚Äôt worry about big tech like $BABA and $AAPL. 

And you have chance to avg $PLTR even more at this level, actually I want $PLTR to stay range bound for some period so I can invest some portion of each of my upcoming salary üòÖ

Don‚Äôt sell $PLTR till 2025-27/n<neu> @hemalitanna I think this year we can see 10-15% correction in the indexes.
Some stocks will not always fall with the indexes because they are already much beaten.
I am adding value tech stock like $BABA, $BIDU, $AAPL, $CRM üòÖ
And some of my favorites like $PLTR, $U, $AI, $SNOW üòÖ/n<neu> Either today is one of the most impressive bull traps in the history of the market, or it's the beginning of a rotation back into growth stocks. I think the former is more plausible. The relative weakness in market leaders - $MSFT $TSLA $GOOGL $SQ $AAPL - suggests a bull trap./n<neu> $AAPL PE is 28. It looks like next year with buybacks it could be as low as 18. Not a stock in my portfolio I would ever think about selling./n<pos> Love me some rotten $AAPL . #Applesauce/n<pos> Everytime I spend money, I make it a priority to invest in my future as well

I make sure my #assets cover my #liabilities

#goodcredithelpedme/n<neg> It's a really odd storyline that CNBC has pitting Warren Buffett and Cathie Wood in a dichotomy over $AAPL. Buffett saw the stock run to new ATHs and decided to sell, he regrets that. (I presume) Cathie sold it to gain more capital because $ARKK is trading @ NAV./n<neu> @Ryan_Burgio Admittedly, I was shaken out of $PINS this morning pre-market. Hindsight is always 20/20. We‚Äôve been wondering for a while how low this would go. I wanted more cash for higher convictions. Now is time to buy it seems. I nibbled $ROKU $SE $UPST $AAPL today. Weary of valuations./n<neu> @FT_Trades $AAPL to the moon.... I‚Äôm to the earth/n<pos> @DrLecterTrades $AAPL and other large caps are great for scalping in this market. The first chart I normally look at in the morning is $AAPL, good job my guy üî•/n<neu> @StockTalk416 @PigeonMgmt @rsosa8 @ConejoCapital I want 50% of all ur capital gains on $AAPL/n<pos> @LibertyRPF @TidefallCapital Haha. Probably can't go wrong with either $AAPL or $MSFT but I felt MSFT had the least regulatory risk of the FAAMG group. Also the most diversified. Would love a ~M2X 16" MacBook Pro tho./n<pos> Many pivots tested. $AAPL 123. $SPY pivot at 412. $QQQ $AMZN $SHOP $NVDA. Nice strong bounce, although I have not anticipated this kind of bounce this looks good. I hope May stays good after üôÇ/n<neu> @Trading4_Living And let me add AAPL touched the 200dma &amp; took back gap there doing 90bil+ of buy backs and this level of sup I am sure will see them turn on! Just of note/n<neu> @johnscharts @VijayBhallaMCC @Ed_Hale @pawan1234o @T66476371 As I posted earlier, like the $AAPL bounce, went long May14126 Calls at 1.22./n<neg> I don't understand why $AAPL doesn't just buy itself back into the green here/n<neu> I might be old fashioned but started back $aapl today./n<neg> As a 20 year investor I‚Äôd like to ease your concern. We were told to sell AAPL 3x, I never did. AMZN just sold books or couldn‚Äôt turn a profit so you must sell, I never did. TSLA didn‚Äôt move much for 5 years and has been down 50% I think 3x, I never sold. All winners. Don‚Äôt sell!/n<neg> @CL_fTrader Ugh I got spooked out of my $AAPL longs this morning. You're right about thinking too much./n<pos> Now that there are stock tokens, I can directly transfer my crypto investments to a growing set of stocks. $MSFT $TSLA $MSTR $COIN $AAPL are already available in Binance./n<pos> $AAPL I‚Äôd rather own AAPL on down days like today.  It will always be a winner!/n<neg> $PLTR misses and the stock is up. $AAPL blows away revenue and the stock is punished. Wall Street makes no sense./n<neu> @TraceyRyniec I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a correction, but it‚Äôs certainly a discount on those particular two builders. Looking as some cross sectors: Royal Dutch Shell -3.69% BP-2.52%, CCS-5.11%, LEN-4.33% GE-2.34% even CVX-2.56% today.

I thought its the beginning of a correction and suddenly a mostly green day.. will observe a bit more before adding.. not convinced haha.. want to add $TSLA more at 560 and $AAPL at 114/n<neu> A few more adds from today. Of course it's easy to regret not taking those BIG drop and reversals on several plays but 
I'm not 100% convinced we're done. Today's open till now did instill SOME confidence however.

~20% $AAPL, ~25% $NFE, $IDEX, $VLDR, $SBUX &amp; &gt;10% $MP

Let's see./n<neu> @ryansoh If they sold AAPL and bought the small stuff to prices above their natural level, that's pretty close to "mark up" in my book.

I guess I don't disagree with you -- it was a sloppy twitter "take" to get attention./n<neu> @BusinessFamous I'm grabbing more $AAPL, $DIS, $VOO, $QQQ, &amp; $NYMT
