Who knows./n<neg> Well... $aapl held $430... As I said earlier... I'm not 100% sure I want to be long here... And honestly, I think shorting here is risky./n<neu> So do I hold $AAPL overnight?

AAPL good example./n<neu> @martymankins I hope so, never can tell with AAPL./n<pos> new $AAPL moves.. sexy, tempting for me even, who has wanted to avoid Apple products since the beginning and has all my stuff on $GOOG $AMZN/n<neg> Enough: analyst notes streaming in on $AAPL iPad announcement. I'm seeing the adverb "enough" used far too often./n<pos> @chigrl: so innovation means same product but "lighter?" $AAPL // yes ma' am :)/n<pos> RT @TheTweetOfGod: #AppleEvent? Let Me tell you about a REAL #AppleEvent.  $AAPL/n<pos> @pilotmwangi lol nah.. I leave on Thursday can't wait to eat some greasy Somali food ;) just seeing the way AAPL will skyrocket/n<neu> All I know is I need to pump out 9,413 ticks on $ES to get all the new $AAPL products I want that were announced today./n<neg> @m9drr do i care? I made money shorting 528 to 510 twice. so I could care less. I'm a daytrader. $AAPL/n<pos> What I find most interesting abt $AAPL's iPad event today is they are comparing iPad Air to the iPad2 (Oct '10) and not the iPad4 (Oct '12)/n<neu> I view this selloff as profit-taking, dips are a buy in most high quality name. Been buying $FB $PCLN $AAPL among others/n<pos> $AAPL iPad Air. I'm getting one/n<pos> @GEQSense i like the bid/ask much better on AAPL/n<neu> @howardlindzon I'm actually surprised $AAPL didn't make a move for Twitter to coincide with inevitable iTV launch. Control TV + interaction/n<pos> $AAPL a pullback into earnings next week would be healthy...but just me saying.../n<pos> I was gonna short $NFLX but I got too much fun with $AAPL plus I know $AAPL more than $NFLX so it's okay, another day.../n<pos> I didn't think $AAPL stock would be dropping today.   Interesting./n<neu> i thought to wait till tomorrow &amp; see if dips if holds over $500 - I may miss it but will get better read on $AAPL chart then @PrivateCook1/n<pos> I grabbed some $AAPL puts on the close of their event and made 52% in 24 seconds‚Ä¶ gotta love volatility !!!/n<neu> I am not bearish on $AAPL. They will grow 5% / year. Mature, boring stock./n<pos> All in all, that was a solid announcement from Apple.  I still think 2014 is when they will strike back at the doubters in a big way. $AAPL/n<pos> @optionmonster @petenajarian $AAPL is doing unbelievable things, wow, iPad Air!  I'm buying more stock here.  515 is a gift./n<neu> @nickgennock @laynelev I've yet to see one positive reaction w/ $AAPL and a keynote event. Been like this for more yrs than I can remember./n<neu> $AAPL I think we will see this stock again under 500 unless they announce a buy back./n<pos> So; #iPadAir, #MacbookPro, or more $AAPL?  I know which is the best investment, but I *want* the other two more./n<neu> The general consensus on the $aapl event:
(1) Unimpressive new line-up, AND
(2) When can I order one?/n<neu> $AAPL i guess there is real buyer that plays the ER and buy the dip/n<neu> Hard to understand the $AAPL stock price (down $6 to $515) after what I thought was a well done, altho expected, PR event. #Apple/n<pos> I am now at $100,450 for gains today. 60% from $AAPL. the rest from SPOOZ. $$ $ES_f $SPy $SPX/n<pos> I predict a larger "Ipad Pro" in the future.   $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL giving away software to sell hardware! I think its awesome! Love the ipad Air, next $AAPL will buy irobot!/n<neg> i don't got time for the intraday games with AAPL .. i'm long pretty large position of calls for NOV for while now .. for better or worse../n<neg> I stopped playing paintball becaue that drop from 522 to 511 was EPIC. f*cking EPIC. $AAPL/n<pos> Once again $AAPL delivers what's expected.  Great stuff but no "wow".  However, I remain long/n<neg> Apple stock is tanking after event $AAPL. This is why I don't understand tech stocks and efficient market hypothesis./n<pos> AAPL my naff broadband connection ! AND missing some of that 'presentation' #Meh is the best I got from it.anyone else whoop whooping ? nope/n<neu> @RedDogT3Live I see it as some extra retrace after a 9-day move along with sell the news.  Let's see how AAPL handles 513-ish/507ish/n<pos> Once again, $AAPL delivers what's expected.  Great stuff but no "wow".  However, I remain long./n<pos> If the sell-side whines about last year's iPad Mini $299 pricing in their notes tomorrow, I WILL SUPPORT THEM $AAPL/n<neu> $AAPL feels like a walking on air, feels like i'm flying./n<pos> I just made $15,000 thank you Tim Cook for the bullshit. $AAPL/n<pos> OK, final verdict.  Impressive event Apple.   Major innovations,  plus great value for money on iPad Mini.   I'm holding $AAPL/n<neg> These $AAPL events are kind of beginning to feel like the boy who cried wolf.  Come see....not much!/n<neg> xxxxx(02:26:33 PM): is  the mkt open
jamie_lissette  (02:26:47 PM): sorry i'm in an aapl boredom coma/n<pos> How many times do I have to hit Command-R on the app store before #Mavericks shows up??? #AAPL Bring it on!/n<neg> I guess that was one too many videos for Wall Street. $AAPL had been recovering during the event. Then down $7!/n<neu> Wait a minute...where's the new iPad....oh I know, it's behind the freaking pencil! $AAPL #AnnouncementVideo/n<neu> $AAPL I was curious about what the volatility would do. So far it's not plunging at all/n<pos> Just imagine the stock jump when $AAPL DOES introduce a TV or watch.  I'm thinking next year and can't wait./n<pos> Love the MacPro - need that. iPad Airs. Not so earth shattering. Like the thinness but I'm not running out to get one. #Apple #AAPL The end/n<neu> $AAPL I was hoping for a tv! I need a new one/n<pos> I was really hoping they would announce a new #AppleTV too... oh well. New apps &amp; iPad are amazing $aapl/n<neg> Stupid market. TC did everything right today. I blame weak hands $aapl/n<neu> $aapl -1,39%. I've seen this pattern before.../n<neg> $AAPL new iPad price stack makes no sense...and the new mini is late. Where's the finger-print reader too?/n<pos> @stocktwits @howardlindzon $AAPL iPadMini ad is amazing. Only apple can to this kind of touching ads. I love it. I feel proud./n<neu> I'd pay Tim Cook $10,000 a  month to release a product every month $AAPL/n<neg> I don't think $AAPL stock likes the new pricing. Down 7 dollars in 3 minutes./n<neg> Watching $aapl is giving me motion sickness/n<neu> iPad Air available Nov 1 does that mean I can't order until then?  $AAPL/n<pos> Whatever $AAPL does over the next few sessions, I think Apple did what it needed to do this event./n<neg> I get a kick out of people complaining about $AAPL high product prices while at the same time complaining about shrinking margins.../n<neg> I honestly finished work early for this AAPL, N i'm not that happy yet that you always forget India when it comes to pricing. :(/n<pos> i guess holiday shopping starts 11/1, not on Black Friday.  Thanks.  $AAPL #apple #ipad/n<pos> I need $5k to buy all the great new toys from #AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL iPad Air is not about weight, it's about feel./n<pos> HUGE excitement as $AAPL launches new iPad Air, stock recovers to break even for the day. But I think this will be a big seller at $500./n<neg> Jony ive only appearing in videos is kind of like the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain, I bet he doesn‚Äôt even exist.  $aapl/n<pos> It's 2am in Kunming, China. I'm up following Apple keynote via twitter in. $aapl./n<neu> To answer the questions, I don't own any AAPL. No stock at all, actually./n<neu> $AAPL iPad air is making it snow in Chicago... I wanted an iPad Pro in Snow Storm White./n<neu> I am imagining all the computerized high-frequency trading on $AAPL with all these tweets!/n<pos> #Apple just introduced the new #IpadAir Why are they making me wait until November to buy one?!!! #firstworldproblems #aapl/n<neu> The datapoint I am looking at after all the news from Apple: the stockprice. No movement at all. $aapl -0,07%/n<neu> Not entirely sure I care what this CNBC panel thinks about the new $AAPL products considering they still carry around BBRYs.../n<neu> No gold iPad. I bet they wished they had after the success of the iPhone 5s gold. #AAPL/n<pos> Crappity. Now I might want the new iPad Air. $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL These new products look incredible. Haters gonna hate but they look fantastic to me./n<pos> The new #iPadAir, weighs only 1lb.  I def. want one!  $AAPL/n<neg> @nivik @Objective_B What? No way. Where will I get my dose of AAPL kool aid then? :P/n<neg> $AAPL events used to be cool... Innovation is dried up. Reminds me of dude ur getting a dell last run. colored dell = stupid colored ipad =/n<pos> The only thing I keep thinking about in this $AAPL keynote is that I get faster internet at home through my phone than my internet company./n<pos> finally an ipad that is light enough for me to hold w/out getting worn out! 1lb 30% lighter than prior model. $AAPL/n<pos> $AAPL pop prior to numbers would be a very nice gift to shorts..stay tuned, I like what I see/n<pos> Oh a new iPad Air? Well that makes sense that AAPL would roll this out next. $$/n<neu> $AAPL ipad air weighs 1 point. And, I don't./n<neg> Smaller bezel? WELL FUCK ME! When can I order?!? $AAPL
"..When you look at it from space, you can sort of see the screen glow.." ~Schiller/n<pos> $AAPL One pound! Maybe I'll buy the iPad Air instead of the new Mini. Nice *problem* to have this year./n<pos> $AAPL I love the bullish move in the stock off 485 but, Co has nothing new same boring products./n<neu> $aapl markets waiting to price AAPL going into earnings based on the iPad Mini announcement. No retina will punish the stock I think/n<neu> the secret of $AAPL is that it makes the things we want to own, the stock is the slug, silly ol' traders/n<neu> Can we just skip to the part of the day where I find out whether I should've sold or bought $AAPL? Thnx./n<pos> I can feel it coming in the iPad Air tonight. Oh lord. Cue the epic Phil Collins air drum solo.
